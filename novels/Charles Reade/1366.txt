book each starting with chapter r where r is the chapter number expressed as a roman numeral authors preface a small portion of this tale appeared in once a week julyseptember under the title of a good fight after writing it i took wider views of the subject and also felt uneasy at having deviated unnecessarily from the historical outline of a true story these two sentiments have cost me more than a years very hard labour which i venture to think has not been wasted after this plain statement i trust all who comment on this work will see that to describe it as a reprint would be unfair to the public and to me the english language is copious and in any true mans hands quite able to convey the truthnamely that onefifth of the present work is a reprint and fourfifths of it a new composition charles reade chapter i not a day passes over the earth but men and women of no note do great deeds speak great words and suffer noble sorrows of these obscure heroes philosophers and martyrs the greater part will never be known till that hour when many that are great shall be small and the small great but of others the worlds knowledge may be said to sleep their lives and characters lie hidden from nations in the annals that record them the general reader cannot feel them they are presented so curtly and coldly they are not like breathing stories appealing to his heart but little historic hailstones striking him but to glance off his bosom nor can he understand them for epitomes are not narratives as skeletons are not human figures thus records of prime truths remain a dead letter to plain folk the writers have left so much to the imagination and imagination is so rare a gift here then the writer of fiction may be of use to the publicas an interpreter there is a musty chronicle written in intolerable latin and in it a chapter where every sentence holds a fact here is told with harsh brevity the strange history of a pair who lived untrumpeted and died unsung four hundred years ago and lie now as unpitied in that stern page as fossils in a rock thus living or dead fate is still unjust to them for if i can but show you what lies below that dry chroniclers words methinks you will correct the indifference of centuries and give those two soretried souls a place in your heartfor a day it was past the middle of the fifteenth century louis xi was sovereign of france edward iv was wrongful king of england and philip the good having by force and cunning dispossessed his cousin jacqueline and broken her heart reigned undisturbed this many years in holland where our tale begins elias and catherine his wife lived in the little town of tergou he traded wholesale and retail in cloth silk brown holland and above all in curried leather a material highly valued by the middling people because it would stand twenty years wear and turn an ordinary knife no small virtue in a jerkin of that century in which folk were so liberal of their steel even at dinner a man would leave his meat awhile and carve you his neighbour on a very moderate difference of opinion the couple were well to do and would have been free from all earthly care but for nine children when these were coming into the world one per annum each was hailed with rejoicings and the saints were thanked not expostulated with and when parents and children were all young together the latter were looked upon as lovely little playthings invented by heaven for the amusement joy and evening solace of people in business but as the olivebranches shot up and the parents grew older and saw with their own eyes the fate of large families misgivings and care mingled with their love they belonged to a singularly wise and provident people in holland reckless parents were as rare as disobedient children so now when the huge loaf came in on a gigantic trencher looking like a fortress in its moat and the tour of the table once made seemed to have melted away elias and catherine would look at one another and say who is to find bread for them all when we are gone at this observation the younger ones needed all their filial respect to keep their little dutch countenances for in their opinion dinner and supper came by nature like sunrise and sunset and so long as that luminary should travel round the earth so long as the brown loaf go round their family circle and set in their stomachs only to rise again in the family oven but the remark awakened the national thoughtfulness of the elder boys and being often repeated set several of the family thinking some of them good thoughts some ill thoughts according to the nature of the thinkers kate the children grow so this table will soon be too small we cannot afford it eli replied catherine answering not his words but his thought after the manner of women their anxiety for the future took at times a less dismal but more mortifying turn the free burghers had their pride as well as the nobles and these two could not bear that any of their blood should go down in the burgh after their decease so by prudence and selfdenial they managed to clothe all the little bodies and feed all the great mouths and yet put by a small hoard to meet the future and as it grew and grew they felt a pleasure the miser hoarding for himself knows not one day the eldest boy but one aged nineteen came to his mother and with that outward composure which has so misled some persons as to the real nature of this people begged her to intercede with his father to send him to amsterdam and place him with a merchant it is the way of life that likes me merchants are wealthy i am good at numbers prithee good mother take my part in this and i shall ever be as i am now your debtor catherine threw up her hands with dismay and incredulity what leave tergou what is one street to me more than another if i can leave the folk of tergou i can surely leave the stones what quit your poor father now he is no longer young mother if i can leave you i can leave what leave your poor brothers and sisters that love you so dear there are enough in the house without me what mean you richart who is more thought of than you stay have i spoken sharp to you have i been unkind to you never that i know of and if you had you should never hear of it from me mother said richart gravely but the tear was in his eye it all lies in a word and nothing can change my mind there will be one mouth less for you to feed there now see what my tongue has done said catherine and the next moment she began to cry for she saw her first young bird on the edge of the nest trying his wings to fly into the world richart had a calm strong will and she knew he never wasted a word it ended as nature has willed all such discourse shall end young richart went to amsterdam with a face so long and sad as it had never been seen before and a heart like granite that afternoon at supper there was one mouth less catherine looked at richarts chair and wept bitterly on this elias shouted roughly and angrily to the children sit wider cant ye sit wider and turned his head away over the back of his seat awhile and was silent richart was launched and never cost them another penny but to fit him out and place him in the house of vander stegen the merchant took all the little hoard but one gold crown they began again two years passed richart found a niche in commerce for his brother jacob and jacob left tergou directly after dinner which was at eleven in the forenoon at supper that day elias remembered what had happened the last time so it was in a low whisper he said sit wider dears now until that moment catherine would not see the gap at table for her daughter catherine had besought her not to grieve tonight and she had said no sweetheart i promise i will not since it vexes my children but when elias whispered sit wider says she ay the table will soon be too big for the children and you thought it would be too small and having delivered this with forced calmness she put up her apron the next moment and wept sore tis the best that leave us sobbed she that is the cruel part nay nay said elias our children are good children and all are dear to us alike heed her not what god takes from us still seems better that what he spares to us that is to say men are by nature unthankfuland women silly and i say richart and jacob were the flower of the flock sobbed catherine the little coffer was empty again and to fill it they gathered like ants in those days speculation was pretty much confined to the cardanddice business elias knew no way to wealth but the slow and sure one a penny saved is a penny gained was his humble creed all that was not required for the business and the necessaries of life went into the little coffer with steel bands and florid key they denied themselves in turn the humblest luxuries and then catching one anothers looks smiled perhaps with a greater joy than selfindulgence has to bestow and so in three years more they had gleaned enough to set up their fourth son as a mastertailor and their eldest daughter as a robemaker in tergou here were two more provided for their own trade would enable them to throw work into the hands of this pair but the coffer was drained to the dregs and this time the shop too bled a little in goods if not in coin alas there remained on hand two that were unable to get their bread and two that were unwilling the unable ones were giles a dwarf of the wrong sort half stupidity half malice all head and claws and voice run from by dogs and unprejudiced females and sided with through thick and thin by his mother little catherine a poor little girl that could only move on crutches she lived in pain but smiled through it with her marble face and violet eyes and long silky lashes and fretful or repining word never came from her lips the unwilling ones were sybrandt the youngest a neerdoweel too much in love with play to work and cornelis the eldest who had made calculations and stuck to the hearth waiting for dead mens shoes almost worn out by their repeated efforts and above all dispirited by the moral and physical infirmities of those that now remained on hand the anxious couple would often say what will become of all these when we shall be no longer here to take care of them but when they had said this a good many times suddenly the domestic horizon cleared and then they used still to say it because a habit is a habit but they uttered it half mechanically now and added brightly and cheerfully but thanks to st bavon and all the saints theres gerard young gerard was for many years of his life a son apart and he was going into the church and the church could always maintain her children by hook or by crook in those days no great hopes because his family had no interest with the great to get him a benefice and the young mans own habits were frivolous and indeed such as our cloth merchant would not have put up with in any one but a clerk that was to be his trivialities were reading and penmanship and he was so wrapped up in them that often he could hardly be got away to his meals the day was never long enough for him and he carried ever a tinderbox and brimstone matches and begged ends of candles of the neighbours which he lighted at unreasonable hoursay even at eight of the clock at night in winter when the very burgomaster was abed endured at home his practices were encouraged by the monks of a neighbouring convent they had taught him penmanship and continued to teach him until one day they discovered in the middle of a lesson that he was teaching them they pointed this out to him in a merry way he hung his head and blushed he had suspected as much himself but mistrusted his judgment in so delicate a matter but my son said an elderly monk how is it that you to whom god has given an eye so true a hand so subtle yet firm and a heart to love these beautiful crafts how is it you do not colour as well as write a scroll looks but barren unless a border of fruit and leaves and rich arabesques surround the good words and charm the sense as those do the soul and understanding to say nothing of the pictures of holy men and women departed with which the several chapters should be adorned and not alone the eye soothed with the brave and sweetly blended colours but the heart lifted by effigies of the saints in glory answer me my son at this gerard was confused and muttered that he had made several trials at illuminating but had not succeeded well and thus the matter rested soon after this a fellowenthusiast came on the scene in the unwonted form of an old lady margaret sister and survivor of the brothers van eyck left flanders and came to end her days in her native country she bought a small house near tergou in course of time she heard of gerard and saw some of his handiwork it pleased her so well that she sent her female servant reicht heynes to ask him to come to her this led to an acquaintance it could hardly be otherwise for little tergou had never held so many as two zealots of this sort before at first the old lady damped gerards courage terribly at each visit she fished out of holes and corners drawings and paintings some of them by her own hand that seemed to him unapproachable but if the artist overpowered him the woman kept his heart up she and reicht soon turned him inside out like a glove among other things they drew from him what the good monks had failed to hit upon the reason why he did not illuminate viz that he could not afford the gold the blue and the red but only the cheap earths and that he was afraid to ask his mother to buy the choice colours and was sure he should ask her in vain then margaret van eyck gave him a little brushgold and some vermilion and ultramarine and a piece of good vellum to lay them on he almost adored her as he left the house reicht ran after him with a candle and two quarters he quite kissed her but better even than the gold and lapislazuli to the illuminator was the sympathy to the isolated enthusiast that sympathy was always ready and as he returned it an affection sprung up between the old painter and the young caligrapher that was doubly characteristic of the time for this was a century in which the fine arts and the higher mechanical arts were not separated by any distinct boundary nor were those who practised them and it was an age in which artists sought out and loved one another should this last statement stagger a painter or writer of our day let me remind him that even christians loved one another at first starting backed by an acquaintance so venerable and strengthened by female sympathy gerard advanced in learning and skill his spirits too rose visibly he still looked behind him when dragged to dinner in the middle of an initial g but once seated showed great social qualities likewise a gay humour that had hitherto but peeped in him shone out and often he set the table in a roar and kept it there sometimes with his own wit sometimes with jests which were glossy new to his family being drawn from antiquity as a return for all he owed his friends the monks he made them exquisite copies from two of their choicest mss viz the life of their founder and their comedies of terence the monastery finding the vellum the high and puissant prince philip the good duke of burgundy luxemburg and brabant earl of holland and zealand lord of friesland count of flanders artois and hainault lord of salins and macklynwas versatile he could fight as well as any king going and lie could lie as well as any except the king of france he was a mighty hunter and could read and write his tastes were wide and ardent he loved jewels like a woman and gorgeous apparel he dearly loved maids of honour and indeed paintings generally in proof of which he ennobled jan van eyck he had also a rage for giants dwarfs and turks these last stood ever planted about him turbaned and blazing with jewels his agents inveigled them from istamboul with fair promises but the moment he had got them he baptized them by brute force in a large tub and this done let them squat with their faces towards mecca and invoke mahound as much as they pleased laughing in his sleeve at their simplicity in fancying they were still infidels he had lions in cages and fleet leopards trained by orientals to run down hares and deer in short he relished all rarities except the humdrum virtues for anything singularly pretty or diabolically ugly this was your customer the best of him was he was openhanded to the poor and the next best was he fostered the arts in earnest whereof he now gave a signal proof he offered prizes for the best specimens of orfevrerie in two kinds religious and secular item for the best paintings in white of egg oils and tempera these to be on panel silk or metal as the artists chose item for the best transparent painting on glass item for the best illuminating and borderpainting on vellum item for the fairest writing on vellum the burgomasters of the several towns were commanded to aid all the poorer competitors by receiving their specimens and sending them with due care to rotterdam at the expense of their several burghs when this was cried by the bellman through the streets of tergou a thousand mouths opened and one heart beatgerards he told his family timidly he should try for two of those prizes they stared in silence for their breath was gone at his audacity but one horrid laugh exploded on the floor like a petard gerard looked down and there was the dwarf slit and fanged from ear to ear at his expense and laughing like a lion nature relenting at having made giles so small had given him as a setoff the biggest voice on record his very whisper was a bassoon he was like those stunted widemouthed pieces of ordnance we see on fortifications more like a flowerpot than a cannon but ods tympana how they bellow gerard turned red with anger the more so as the others began to titter white catherine saw and a pink tinge came on her cheek she said softly why do you laugh is it because he is our brother you think he cannot be capable yes gerard try with the rest many say you are skilful and mother and i will pray the virgin to guide your hand thank you little kate you shall pray to our lady and our mother shall buy me vellum and the colours to illuminate with what will they cost my lad two gold crowns about three shillings and fourpence english money what screamed the housewife when the bushel of rye costs but a groat what me spend a months meal and meat and fire on such vanity as that the lightning from heaven would fall on me and my children would all be beggars mother sighed little catherine imploringly oh it is in vain kate said gerard with a sigh i shall have to give it up or ask the dame van eyck she would give it me but i think shame to be for ever taking from her it is not her affair said catherine very sharply what has she to do coming between me and my son and she left the room with a red face little catherine smiled presently the housewife returned with a gracious affectionate air and two little gold pieces in her hand there sweetheart said she you wont have to trouble dame or demoiselle for two paltry crowns but on this gerard fell a thinking how he could spare her purse one will do mother i will ask the good monks to let me send my copy of their terence it is on snowy vellum and i can write no better so then i shall only need six sheets of vellum for my borders and miniatures and gold for my ground and prime coloursone crown will do never tyne the ship for want of a bit of tar gerard said his changeable mother but she added well there i will put the crown in my pocket that wont be like putting it back in the box going to the box to take out instead of putting in it is like going to my heart with a knife for so many drops of blood you will be sure to want it gerard the house is never built for less than the builder counted on sure enough when the time came gerard longed to go to rotterdam and see the duke and above all to see the work of his competitors and so get a lesson from defeat and the crown came out of the housewifes pocket with a very good grace gerard would soon be a priest it seemed hard if he might not enjoy the world a little before separating himself from it for life the night before he went margaret van eyck asked him to take a letter for her and when he came to look at it to his surprise he found it was addressed to the princess marie at the stadthouse in rotterdam the day before the prizes were to be distributed gerard started for rotterdam in his holiday suit to wit a doublet of silvergrey cloth with sleeves and a jerkin of the same over it but without sleeves from his waist to his heels he was clad in a pair of tightfitting buckskin hose fastened by laces called points to his doublet his shoes were pointed in moderation and secured by a strap that passed under the hollow of the foot on his head and the back of his neck he wore his flowing hair and pinned to his back between his shoulders was his hat it was further secured by a purple silk ribbon little kate had passed round him from the sides of the hat and knotted neatly on his breast below his hat attached to the upper rim of his broad waistbelt was his leathern wallet when he got within a league of rotterdam he was pretty tired but he soon fell in with a pair that were more so he found an old man sitting by the roadside quite worn out and a comely young woman holding his hand with a face brimful of concern the country people trudged by and noticed nothing amiss but gerard as he passed drew conclusions even dress tells a tale to those who study it so closely as he did being an illuminator the old man wore a gown and a fur tippet and a velvet cap sure signs of dignity but the triangular purse at his girdle was lean the gown rusty the fur worn sure signs of poverty the young woman was dressed in plain russet cloth yet snowwhite lawn covered that part of her neck the gown left visible and ended half way up her white throat in a little band of gold embroidery and her headdress was new to gerard instead of hiding her hair in a pile of linen or lawn she wore an open network of silver cord with silver spangles at the interstices in this her glossy auburn hair was rolled in front into two solid waves and supported behind in a luxurious and shapely mass his quick eye took in all this and the old mans pallor and the tears in the young womans eyes so when he had passed them a few yards he reflected and turned back and came towards them bashfully father i fear you are tired indeed my son i am replied the old man and faint for lack of food gerards address did not appear so agreeable to the girl as to the old man she seemed ashamed and with much reserve in her manner said that it was her faultshe had underrated the distance and imprudently allowed her father to start too late in the day no no said the old man it is not the distance it is the want of nourishment the girl put her arms round his neck with tender concern but took that opportunity of whispering father a strangera young man but it was too late gerard with simplicity and quite as a matter of course fell to gathering sticks with great expedition this done he took down his wallet out with the manchet of bread and the iron flask his careful mother had put up and his everlasting tinderbox lighted a match then a candleend then the sticks and put his iron flask on it then down he went on his stomach and took a good blow then looking up he saw the girls face had thawed and she was looking down at him and his energy with a demure smile he laughed back to her mind the pot said he and dont let it spill for heavens sake theres a cleft stick to hold it safe with and with this he set off running towards a cornfield at some distance whilst he was gone there came by on a mule with rich purple housings an old man redolent of wealth the purse at his girdle was plethoric the fur on his tippet was ermine broad and new it was ghysbrecht van swieten the burgomaster of tergou he was old and his face furrowed he was a notorious miser and looked one generally but the idea of supping with the duke raised him just now into manifest complacency yet at the sight of the faded old man and his bright daughter sitting by a fire of sticks the smile died out of his face and he wore a strange look of pain and uneasiness he reined in his mule why petermargaret said he almost fiercely what mummery is this peter was going to answer but margaret interposed hastily and said my father was exhausted so i am warming something to give him strength before we go on what reduced to feed by the roadside like the bohemians said ghysbrecht and his hand went into his purse but it did not seem at home there it fumbled uncertainly afraid too large a coin might stick to a finger and come out at this moment who should come bounding up but gerard he had two straws in his hand and he threw himself down by the fire and relieved margaret of the cooking part then suddenly recognizing the burgomaster he coloured all over ghysbrecht van swieten started and glared at him and took his hand out of his purse oh said he bitterly i am not wanted and went slowly on casting a long look of suspicion on margaret and hostility on gerard that was not very intelligible however there was something about it that margaret could read enough to blush at and almost toss her head gerard only stared with surprise by st bavon i think the old miser grudges us three our quart of soup said he when the young man put that interpretation on ghysbrechts strange and meaning look margaret was greatly relieved and smiled gaily on the speaker meanwhile ghysbrecht plodded on more wretched in his wealth than these in their poverty and the curious thing is that the mule the purple housings and onehalf the coin in that plethoric purse belonged not to ghysbrecht van swieten but to that faded old man and that comely girl who sat by a roadside fire to be fed by a stranger they did not know this but ghysbrecht knew it and carried in his heart a scorpion of his own begetting that scorpion is remorsethe remorse that not being penitence is incurable and ready for fresh misdeeds upon a fresh temptation twenty years ago when ghysbrecht van swieten was a hard and honest man the touchstone opportunity came to him and he did an act of heartless roguery it seemed a safe one it had hitherto proved a safe one though he had never felt safe today he had seen youth enterprise and above all knowledge seated by fair margaret and her father on terms that look familiar and loving and the fiends are at big ear again chapter ii the soup is hot said gerard but how are we to get it to our mouths inquired the senior despondingly father the young man has brought us straws and margaret smiled slily ay ay said the old man but my poor bones are stiff and indeed the fire is too hot for a body to kneel over with these short straws st john the baptist but the young man is adroit for while he stated his difficulty gerard removed it he untied in a moment the knot on his breast took his hat off put a stone into each corner of it then wrapping his hand in the tail of his jerkin whipped the flask off the fire wedged it in between the stones and put the hat under the old mans nose with a merry smile the other tremulously inserted the pipe of ryestraw and sucked lo and behold his wan drawn face was seen to light up more and more till it quite glowed and as soon as he had drawn a long breath hippocrates and galen he cried tis a soupe au vinthe restorative of restoratives blessed be the nation that invented it and the woman that made it and the young man who brings it to fainting folk have a suck my girl while i relate to our young host the history and virtues of this his sovereign compound this corroborative young sir was unknown to the ancients we find it neither in their treatises of medicine nor in those popular narratives which reveal many of their remedies both in chirurgery and medicine proper hector in the ilias if my memory does not play me false margaret alas hes off was invited by one of the ladies of the poem to drink a draught of wine but he declined on the plea that he was just going into battle and must not take aught to weaken his powers now if the soupe au vin had been known in troy it is clear that in declining vinum merum upon that score he would have added in the hexameter but a soupe au vin madam i will degust and gratefully not only would this have been but common civilitya virtue no perfect commander is wanting inbut not to have done it would have proved him a shallow and improvident person unfit to be trusted with the conduct of a war for men going into a battle need sustenance and all possible support as is proved by this that foolish generals bringing hungry soldiers to blows with full ones have been defeated in all ages by inferior numbers the romans lost a great battle in the north of italy to hannibal the carthaginian by this neglect alone now this divine elixir gives in one moment force to the limbs and ardour to the spirits and taken into hectors body at the nick of time would by the aid of phoebus venus and the blessed saints have most likely procured the greeks a defeat for note how faint and weary and heartsick i was a minute ago well i suck this celestial cordial and now behold me brave as achilles and strong as an eagle oh father now an eagle alack girl i defy thee and all the world ready i say like a foaming charger to devour the space between this and rotterdam and strong to combat the ills of life even poverty and old age which last philosophers have called the summum malum negatur unless the mans life has been illspentwhich by the bye it generally has now for the moderns father dear father fear me not girl i will be brief unreasonably and unseasonably brief the soupe au vin occurs not in modern science but this is only one proof more if proof were needed that for the last few hundred years physicians have been idiots with their chickenbroth and their decoction of gold whereby they attribute the highest qualities to that meat which has the least juice of any meat and to that metal which has less chemical qualities than all the metals mountebanks dunces homicides since then from these no light is to be gathered go we to the chroniclers and first we find that duguesclin a french knight being about to join battle with the englishmasters at that time of half france and sturdy strikers by sea and landdrank not one but three soupes au vin in honour of the blessed trinity this done he charged the islanders and as might have been foretold killed a multitude and drove the rest into the sea but he was only the first of a long list of holy and hardhitting ones who have by this divine restorative been sustentated fortified corroborated and consoled dear father prithee add thyself to that venerable company ere the soup cools and margaret held the hat imploringly in both hands till he inserted the straw once more this spared them the modern instances and gave gerard an opportunity of telling margaret how proud his mother would be her soup had profited a man of learning ay but said margaret it would like her ill to see her son give all and take none himself why brought you but two straws fair mistress i hoped you would let me put my lips to your straw there being but two margaret smiled and blushed never beg that you may command said she the straw is not mine tis yours you cut it in yonder field i cut it and that made it mine but after that your lip touched it and that made it yours did it then i will lend it you therenow it is yours again your lip has touched it no it belongs to us both now let us divide it by all means you have a knife no i will not cut itthat would be unlucky ill bite it there i shall keep my half you will burn yours once you get home i doubt you know me not i waste nothing it is odds but i make a hairpin of it or something this answer dashed the novice gerard instead of provoking him to fresh efforts and he was silent and now the bread and soup being disposed of the old scholar prepared to continue his journey then came a little difficulty gerard the adroit could not tie his ribbon again as catherine had tied it margaret after slily eyeing his efforts for some time offered to help him for at her age girls love to be coy and tender saucy and gentle by turns and she saw she had put him out of countenance but now then a fair head with its stately crown of auburn hair glossy and glowing through silver bowed sweetly towards him and while it ravished his eye two white supple hands played delicately upon the stubborn ribbon and moulded it with soft and airy touches then a heavenly thrill ran through the innocent young man and vague glimpses of a new world of feeling and sentiment opened on him and these new and exquisite sensations margaret unwittingly prolonged it is not natural to her sex to hurry aught that pertains to the sacred toilet nay when the taper fingers had at last subjugated the ends of the knot her mind was not quite easy till by a manoeuvre peculiar to the female hand she had made her palm convex and so applied it with a gentle pressure to the centre of the knota sweet little coaxing handkiss as much as to say now be a good knot and stay so the palmkiss was bestowed on the ribbon but the wearers heart leaped to meet it there that is how it was said margaret and drew back to take one last keen survey of her work then looking up for simple approval of her skill received full in her eyes a longing gaze of such ardent adoration as made her lower them quickly and colour all over an indescribable tremor seized her and she retreated with downcast lashes and telltale cheeks and took her fathers arm on the opposite side gerard blushing at having scared her away with his eyes took the other arm and so the two young things went downcast and conscious and propped the eagle along in silence they entered rotterdam by the schiedamze poort and as gerard was unacquainted with the town peter directed him the way to the hooch straet in which the stadthouse was he himself was going with margaret to his cousin in the oosterwaagen straet so almost on entering the gate their roads lay apart they bade each other a friendly adieu and gerard dived into the great town a profound sense of solitude fell upon him yet the streets were crowded then he lamented too late that out of delicacy he had not asked his late companions who they were and where they lived beshrew my shamefacedness said he but their words and their breeding were above their means and something did whisper me they would not be known i shall never see her more oh weary world i hate you and your ways to think i must meet beauty and goodness and learningthree pearls of priceand never see them more falling into this sad reverie and letting his body go where it would he lost his way but presently meeting a crowd of persons all moving in one direction he mingled with them for he argued they must be making for the stadthouse soon the noisy troop that contained the moody gerard emerged not upon the stadthouse but upon a large meadow by the side of the maas and then the attraction was revealed games of all sorts were going on wrestling the game of palm the quintain legerdemain archery tumbling in which art i blush to say women as well as men performed to the great delectation of the company there was also a trained bear who stood on his head and marched upright and bowed with prodigious gravity to his master and a hare that beat a drum and a cock that strutted on little stilts disdainfully these things made gerard laugh now and then but the gay scene could not really enliven it for his heart was not in tune with it so hearing a young man say to his fellow that the duke had been in the meadow but was gone to the stadthouse to entertain the burgomasters and aldermen and the competitors for the prizes and their friends he suddenly remembered he was hungry and should like to sup with a prince he left the riverside and this time he found the hooch straet and it speedily led him to the stadthouse but when he got there he was refused first at one door then at another till he came to the great gate of the courtyard it was kept by soldiers and superintended by a pompous majordomo glittering in an embroidered collar and a gold chain of office and holding a white staff with a gold knob there was a crowd of persons at the gate endeavouring to soften this official rock they came up in turn like ripples and retired as such in turn it cost gerard a struggle to get near him and when he was within four heads of the gate he saw something that made his heart beat there was peter with margaret on his arm soliciting humbly for entrance my cousin the alderman is not at home they say he is here what is that to me old man if you will not let us pass in to him at least take this leaf from my tablet to my cousin see i have written his name he will come out to us for what do you take me i carry no messages i keep the gate he then bawled in a stentorian voice inexorably no strangers enter here but the competitors and their companies come old man cried a voice in the crowd you have gotten your answer make way margaret turned half round imploringly good people we are come from far and my father is old and my cousin has a new servant that knows us not and would not let us sit in our cousins house at this the crowd laughed hoarsely margaret shrank as if they had struck her at that moment a hand grasped hersa magic grasp it felt like heart meeting heart or magnet steel she turned quickly round at it and it was gerard such a little cry of joy and appeal came from her bosom and she began to whimper prettily they had hustled her and frightened her for one thing and her cousins thoughtlessness in not even telling his servant they were coming was cruel and the servants caution however wise and faithful to her master was bitterly mortifying to her father and her and to her so mortified and anxious and jostled came suddenly this kind hand and face hinc illae lacrimae all is well now remarked a coarse humourist she hath gotten her sweetheart haw haw haw went the crowd she dropped gerards hand directly and turned round with eyes flashing through her tears i have no sweetheart you rude men but i am friendless in your boorish town and this is a friend and one who knows what you know not how to treat the aged and the weak the crowd was dead silent they had only been thoughtless and now felt the rebuke though severe was just the silence enabled gerard to treat with the porter i am a competitor sir what is your name and the man eyed him suspiciously gerard the son of elias the janitor inspected a slip of parchment he held in his hand gerard eliassoen can enter with my company these two nay those are not your company they came before you what matter they are my friends and without them i go not in stay without then that will i not that we shall see we will and speedily and with this gerard raised a voice of astounding volume and power and routed so that the whole street rang ho philip earl of holland are you mad cried the porter here is one of your varlets defies you hush hush and will not let your guests pass in hush murder the dukes there im dead cried the janitor quaking then suddenly trying to overpower gerards thunder he shouted with all his lungs open the gate ye knaves way there for gerard eliassoen and his company the fiends go with him the gate swung open as by magic eight soldiers lowered their pikes halfway and made an arch under which the victorious three marched in triumphant the moment they had passed the pikes clashed together horizontally to bar the gateway and all but pinned an abdominal citizen that sought to wedge in along with them once past the guarded portal a few steps brought the trio upon a scene of oriental luxury the courtyard was laid out in tables loaded with rich meats and piled with gorgeous plate guests in rich and various costumes sat beneath a leafy canopy of freshcut branches fastened tastefully to golden silver and blue silken cords that traversed the area and fruits of many hues including some artificial ones of gold silver and wax hung pendant or peeped like fair eyes among the green leaves of planetrees and limetrees the dukes minstrels swept their lutes at intervals and a fountain played red burgundy in six jets that met and battled in the air the evening sun darted its fires through those bright and purple wine spouts making them jets and cascades of molten rubies then passing on tinged with the blood of the grape shed crimson glories here and there on fair faces snowy beards velvet satin jewelled hilts glowing gold gleaming silver and sparkling glass gerard and his friends stood dazzled spellbound presently a whisper buzzed round them salute the duke salute the duke they looked up and there on high under the dais was their sovereign bidding them welcome with a kindly wave of the hand the men bowed low and margaret curtsied with a deep and graceful obeisance the dukes hand being up he gave it another turn and pointed the newcomers out to a knot of valets instantly seven of his people with an obedient start went headlong at our friends seated them at a table and put fifteen manycoloured soups before them in little silver bowls and as many wines in crystal vases nay father let us not eat until we have thanked our good friend said margaret now first recovering from all this bustle girl he is our guardian angel gerard put his face into his hands tell me when you have done said he and i will reappear and have my supper for i am hungry i know which of us three is the happiest at meeting again me inquired margaret no guess again father no then i have no guess which it can be and she gave a little crow of happiness and gaiety the soup was tasted and vanished in a twirl of fourteen hands and fish came on the table in a dozen forms with patties of lobster and almonds mixed and of almonds and cream and an immense variety of brouets known to us as rissoles the next trifle was a wild boar which smelt divine why then did margaret start away from it with two shrieks of dismay and pinch so good a friend as gerard because the dukes cuisinier had been too clever had made this excellent dish too captivating to the sight as well as taste he had restored to the animal by elaborate mimicry with burnt sugar and other edible colours the hair and bristles he had robbed him of by fire and water to make him still more enticing the huge tusks were carefully preserved in the brutes jaw and gave his mouth the winning smile that comes of tusk in man or beast and two eyes of coloured sugar glowed in his head st argus what eyes so bright so bloodshot so threateningthey followed a man and every movement of his knife and spoon but indeed i need the pencil of granville or tenniel to make you see the two gilt valets on the opposite side of the table putting the monster down before our friends with a smiling selfsatisfied benevolent obsequiousness for this ghastly monster was the flower of all comestiblesold peter clasping both hands in pious admiration of it margaret wheeling round with horrorstricken eyes and her hand on gerards shoulder squeaking and pinching his face of unwise delight at being pinched the grizzly brute glaring sulkily on all and the guests grinning from ear to ear whats to do shouted the duke hearing the signals of female distress seven of his people with a zealous start went headlong and told him he laughed and said give her of the beefstuffing then and bring me sir boar benevolent monarch the beefstuffing was his own private dish on these grand occasions an ox was roasted whole and reserved for the poor but this wise as well as charitable prince had discovered that whatever venison bares lamb poultry etc you skewered into that beef cavern got cooked to perfection retaining their own juices and receiving those of the reeking ox these he called his beefstuffing and took delight therein as did now our trio for at his word seven of his people went headlong and drove silver tridents into the steaming cave at random and speared a kid a cygnet and a flock of wildfowl these presently smoked before gerard and company and peters face sad and slightly morose at the loss of the savage hog expanded and shone after this twenty different tarts of fruits and herbs and last of all confectionery on a titanic scale cathedrals of sugar all gilt painted in the interstices of the basreliefs castles with moats and ditches imitated to the life elephants camels toads knights on horseback jousting kings and princesses looking on trumpeters blowing and all these personages eating and their veins filled with sweetscented juices works of art made to be destroyed the guests breached a bastion crunched a crusader and his horse and lance or cracked a bishop cope chasuble crosier and all as remorselessly as we do a caraway comfit sipping meanwhile hippocras and other spiced drinks and greek and corsican wines while every now and then little turkish boys turbaned spangled jewelled and gilt came offering on bended knee golden troughs of rosewater and orangewater to keep the guests hands cool and perfumed but long before our party arrived at this final stage appetite had succumbed and gerard had suddenly remembered he was the bearer of a letter to the princess marie and in an undertone had asked one of the servants if he would undertake to deliver it the man took it with a deep obeisance he could not deliver it himself but would instantly give it one of the princesss suite several of whom were about it may be remembered that peter and margaret came here not to dine but to find their cousin well the old gentleman ate heartily andbeing much fatigued dropped asleep and forgot all about his cousin margaret did not remind him we shall hear why meanwhile that cousin was seated within a few feet of them at their backs and discovered them when margaret turned round and screamed at the boar but he forbore to speak to them for municipal reasons margaret was very plainly dressed and peter inclined to threadbare so the alderman said to himself twill be time to make up to them when the sun sets and the company disperses then i will take my poor relations to my house and none will be the wiser half the courses were lost on gerard and margaret they were no great eaters and just now were feeding on sweet thoughts that have ever been unfavourable to appetite but there is a delicate kind of sensuality to whose influence these two were perhaps more sensitive than any other pair in that assemblythe delights of colour music and perfume all of which blended so fascinatingly here margaret leaned back and half closed her eyes and murmured to gerard what a lovely scene the warm sun the green shade the rich dresses the bright music of the lutes and the cool music of the fountain and all faces so happy and gay and then it is to you we owe it gerard was silent all but his eyes observing which now speak not to me said margaret languidly let me listen to the fountain what are you a competitor for he told her very well you will gain one prize at least which which have you seen any of my work i no but you will gain a prize i hope so but what makes you think so because you were so good to my father gerard smiled at the feminine logic and hung his head at the sweet praise and was silent speak not murmured margaret they say this is a world of sin and misery can that be what is your opinion no that is all a silly old song explained gerard tis a byword our elders keep repeating out of custom it is not true how can you know you are but a child said margaret with pensive dignity why only look round and then thought i had lost you for ever and you are by my side and now the minstrels are going to play again sin and misery stuff and nonsense the lutes burst out the courtyard rang again with their delicate harmony what do you admire most of all these beautiful things gerard you know my name how is that white magic i am awitch angels are never witches but i cant think how you foolish boy was it not cried at the gate loud enough to deave one so it was where is my head what do i admire most if you will sit a little more that way ill tell you this way yes so that the light may fall on you there i see many fair things here fairer than i could have conceived but the fairest of all to my eye is your lovely hair in its silver frame and the setting sun kissing it it minds me of what the vulgate praises for beauty an apple of gold in a network of silver and oh what a pity i did not know you before i sent in my poor endeavours at illuminating i could illuminate so much better now i could do everything better there now the sun is full on it it is like an aureole so our lady looked and none since her until today oh fie it is wicked to talk so compare a poor coarsefavoured girl like me with the queen of heaven oh gerard i thought you were a good young man and margaret was shocked apparently gerard tried to explain i am no worse than the rest but how can i help having eyes and a heart margaret gerard be not angry now now is it likely i love you oh for shame you must not say that to me and margaret coloured furiously at this sudden assault i cant help it i love you i love you hush hush for pitys sake i must not listen to such words from a stranger i am ungrateful to call you a stranger oh how one may be mistaken if i had known you were so bold and margarets bosom began to heave and her cheeks were covered with blushes and she looked towards her sleeping father very much like a timid thing that meditates actual flight then gerard was frightened at the alarm he caused forgive me said he imploringly how could any one help loving you well sir i will try and forgive youyou are so good in other respects but then you must promise me never to say youto say that again give me your hand then or you dont forgive me she hesitated but eventually put out her hand a very little way very slowly and with seeming reluctance he took it and held it prisoner when she thought it had been there long enough she tried gently to draw it away he held it tight it submitted quite patiently to force what is the use resisting force she turned her head away and her long eyelashes drooped sweetly gerard lost nothing by his promise words were not needed here and silence was more eloquent nature was in that day what she is in ours but manners were somewhat freer then as now virgins drew back alarmed at the first words of love but of prudery and artificial coquetry there was little and the young soon read one anothers hearts everything was on gerards side his good looks her belief in his goodness her gratitude and opportunity for at the dukes banquet this mellow summer eve all things disposed the female nature to tenderness the avenues to the heart lay open the senses were so soothed and subdued with lovely colours gentle sounds and delicate odours the sun gently sinking the warm air the green canopy the cool music of the now violet fountain gerard and margaret sat hand in hand in silence and gerards eyes sought hers lovingly and hers now and then turned on him timidly and imploringly and presently two sweet unreasonable tears rolled down her cheeks and she smiled while they were drying yet they did not take long and the sun declined and the air cooled and the fountain plashed more gently and the pair throbbed in unison and silence and this weary world looked heaven to them oh the merry days the merry days when we were young oh the merry days the merry days when we were young chapter iii a grave whitehaired seneschal came to their table and inquired courteously whether gerard eliassoen was of their company upon gerards answer he said the princess marie would confer with you young sir i am to conduct you to her presence instantly all faces within hearing turned sharp round and were bent with curiosity and envy on the man that was to go to a princess gerard rose to obey i wager we shall not see you again said margaret calmly but colouring a little that you will was the reply then he whispered in her ear this is my good princess but you are my queen he added aloud wait for me i pray you i will presently return ay ay said peter awaking and speaking at one and the same moment gerard gone the pair whose dress was so homely yet they were with the man whom the princess sent for became the cynosure of neighbouring eyes observing which william johnson came forward acted surprise and claimed his relations and to think that there was i at your backs and you saw me not nay cousin johnson i saw you long syne said margaret coldly you saw me and spoke not to me cousin it was for you to welcome us to rotterdam as it is for us to welcome you at sevenbergen your servant denied us a seat in your house the idiot and i had a mind to see whether it was like maid like master for there is sooth in bywords william johnson blushed purple he saw margaret was keen and suspected him he did the wisest thing under the circumstances trusted to deeds not words he insisted on their coming home with him at once and he would show them whether they were welcome to rotterdam or not who doubts it cousin who doubts it said the scholar margaret thanked him graciously but demurred to go just now said she wanted to hear the minstrels again in about a quarter of an hour johnson renewed his proposal and bade her observe that many of the guests had left then her real reason came out it were ill manners to our friend and he will lose us he knows not where we lodge in rotterdam and the city is large and we have parted company once already oh said johnson we will provide for that my young man ahem i mean my secretary shall sit here and wait and bring him on to my house he shall lodge with me and with no other cousin we shall be too burdensome nay nay you shall see whether you are welcome or not you and your friends and your friends friends if need be and i shall hear what the princess would with him margaret felt a thrill of joy that gerard should be lodged under the same roof with her then she had a slight misgiving but if your young man should be thoughtless and go play and gerard miss him he go play he leave that spot where i put him and bid him stay ho stand forth hans cloterman a figure clad in black serge and dark violet hose arose and took two steps and stood before them without moving a muscle a solemn precise young man the very statue of gravity and starched propriety at his aspect margaret being very happy could hardly keep her countenance but she whispered johnson i would put my hand in the fire for him we are at your command cousin as soon as you have given him his orders hans was then instructed to sit at the table and wait for gerard and conduct him to oosterwaagen straet he replied not in words but by calmly taking the seat indicated and margaret peter and william johnson went away together and indeed it is time you were abed father after all your travel said margaret this had been in her mind all along hans cloterman sat waiting for gerard solemn and businesslike the minutes flew by but excited no impatience in that perfect young man johnson did him no more than justice when he laughed to scorn the idea of his secretary leaving his post or neglecting his duty in pursuit of sport or out of youthful hilarity and frivolity as gerard was long in coming the patient hanshis employers eye being no longer on him improved the time by quaffing solemnly silently and at short but accurately measured intervals goblets of corsican wine the wine was strong so was clotermans head and gerard had been gone a good hour ere the model secretary imbibed the notion that creation expected cloterman to drink the health of all good fellows and nommement of the duke of burgundy there present with this view he filled bumper nine and rose gingerly but solemnly and slowly having reached his full height he instantly rolled upon the grass goblet in hand spilling the cold liquor on more than one anklewhose owners friskedbut not disturbing a muscle in his own long face which in the total eclipse of reason retained its gravity primness and infallibility the seneschal led gerard through several passages to the door of the pavilion where some young noblemen embroidered and feathered sat sentinel guarding the heirapparent and playing cards by the red light of torches their servants held a whisper from the seneschal and one of them rose reluctantly stared at gerard with haughty surprise and entered the pavilion he presently returned and beckoning the pair led then through a passage or two and landed them in an antechamber where sat three more young gentlemen feathered furred and embroidered like pieces of fancy work and deep in that instructive and edifying branch of learning dice you cant see the princessit is too late said one another followed suit she passed this way but now with her nurse she is gone to bed doll and all deuceace again gerard prepared to retire the seneschal with an incredulous smile replied the young man is here by the countesss orders be so good as conduct him to her ladies on this a superb adonis rose with an injured look and led gerard into a room where sat or lolloped eleven ladies chattering like magpies two more industrious than the rest were playing catscradle with fingers as nimble as their tongues at the sight of a stranger all the tongues stopped like one piece of complicated machinery and all the eyes turned on gerard as if the same string that checked the tongues had turned the eyes on gerard was ill at ease before but this battery of eyes discountenanced him and down went his eyes on the ground then the cowards finding like the hare who ran by the pond and the frogs scuttled into the water that there was a creature they could frighten giggled and enjoyed their prowess then a duenna said severely mesdames and they were all abashed at once as though a modesty string had been pulled this same duenna took gerard and marched before him in solemn silence the young mans heart sank and he had half a mind to turn and run out of the place what must princes be he thought when their courtiers are so freezing doubtless they take their breeding from him they serve these reflections were interrupted by the duenna suddenly introducing him into a room where three ladies sat working and a pretty little girl tuning a lute the ladies were richly but not showily dressed and the duenna went up to the one who was hemming a kerchief and said a few words in a low tone this lady then turned towards gerard with a smile and beckoned him to come near her she did not rise but she laid aside her work and her manner of turning towards him slight as the movement was was full of grace and ease and courtesy she began a conversation at once margaret van eyck is an old friend of mine sir and i am right glad to have a letter from her hand and thankful to you sir for bringing it to me safely marie my love this is the gentleman who brought you that pretty miniature sir i thank you a thousand times said the young lady i am glad you feel her debtor sweetheart for our friend would have us to do him a little service in return i will do anything on earth for him replied the young lady with ardour anything on earth is nothing in the world said the countess of charolois quietly well then i willwhat would you have me to do sir gerard had just found out what high society he was in my sovereign demoiselle said he gently and a little tremulously where there have been no pains there needs no reward but we must obey mamma all the world must obey that is true then our demoiselle reward me if you will by letting me hear the stave you were going to sing and i did interrupt it what you love music sir i adore it the little princess looked inquiringly at her mother and received a smile of assent she then took her lute and sang a romaunt of the day although but twelve years old she was a welltaught and painstaking musician her little claw swept the chords with courage and precision and struck out the notes of the arpeggio clear and distinct and bright like twinkling stars but the main charm was her voice it was not mighty but it was round clear full and ringing like a bell she sang with a certain modest eloquence though she knew none of the tricks of feeling she was too young to be theatrical or even sentimental so nothing was forcedall gushed her little mouth seemed the mouth of nature the ditty too was as pure as its utterance as there were none of those false divisionsthose whining slurs which are now sold so dear by italian songsters though every jackal in india delivers them gratis to his customers all night and sometimes gets shot for them and always deserves itso there were no cadences and fiorituri the trite turgid and feeble expletives of song the skimmilk with which mindless musicians and mindless writers quench fire wash out colour and drown melody and meaning dead while the pure and tender strain was flowing from the pure young throat gerards eyes filled the countess watched him with interest for it was usual to applaud the princess loudly but not with cheek and eye so when the voice ceased and the glasses left off ringing she asked demurely was he content gerard gave a little start the spoken voice broke a charm and brought him back to earth oh madam he cried surely it is thus that cherubs and seraphs sing and charm the saints in heaven i am somewhat of your opinion my young friend said the countess with emotion and she bent a look of love and gentle pride upon her girl a heavenly look such as they say is given to the eye of the shortlived resting on the shortlived the countess resumed my old friend request me to be serviceable to you it is the first favour she has done us the honour of asking us and the request is sacred you are in holy orders sir gerard bowed i fear you are not a priest you look too young oh no madam i am not even a subdeacon i am only a lector but next month i shall be an exorcist and before long an acolyth well monsieur gerard with your accomplishments you can soon pass through the inferior orders and let me beg you to do so for the day after you have said your first mass i shall have the pleasure of appointing you to a benefice oh madam and marie remember i make this promise in your name as well as my own fear not mamma i will not forget but if he will take my advice what he will be is bishop of liege the bishop of liege is a beautiful bishop what do you not remember him mamma that day we were at liege he was braver than grandpapa himself he had on a crown a high one and it was cut in the middle and it was full of oh such beautiful jewels and his gown stiff with gold and his mantle too and it had a broad border all pictures but above all his gloves you have no such gloves mamma they were embroidered and covered with jewels and scented with such lovely scent i smelt them all the time he was giving me his blessing on my head with them dear old man i dare say he will die soon most old people do and then sir you can be bishop you know and wear gently marie gently bishoprics are for old gentlemen and this is a young gentleman mamma he is not so very young not compared with you marie eh he is a good birth dear mamma and i am sure he is good enough for a bishop alas mademoiselle you are mistaken i know not that monsieur gerard but i am a little puzzled to know on what grounds mademoiselle there pronounces your character so boldly alas mamma said the princess you have not looked at his face then and she raised her eyebrows at her mothers simplicity i beg your pardon said the countess i have well sir if i cannot go quite so fast as my daughter attribute it to my age not to a want of interest in your welfare a benefice will do to begin your career with and i must take care it is not too far fromwhat call you the place tergou madam a priest gives up much continued the countess often i fear he learns too late how much and her womans eye rested a moment on gerard with mild pity and half surprise at his resigning her sex and all the heaven they can bestow and the great parental joys at least you shall be near your friends have you a mother yes madam thanks be to god good you shall have a church near tergou she will thank me and now sir we must not detain you too long from those who have a better claim on your society than we have duchess oblige me by bidding one of the pages conduct him to the hall of banquet the way is hard to find gerard bowed low to the countess and the princess and backed towards the door i hope it will be a nice benefice said the princess to him with a pretty smile as he was going out then shaking her head with an air of solemn misgiving but you had better have been bishop of liege gerard followed his new conductor his heart warm with gratitude but ere he reached the banquethall a chill came over him the mind of one who has led a quiet uneventful life is not apt to take in contradictory feelings at the same moment and balance them but rather to be overpowered by each in turn while gerard was with the countess the excitement of so new a situation the unlookedfor promise the joy and pride it would cause at home possessed him wholly but now it was passions turn to be heard again what give up margaret whose soft hand he still felt in his and her deep eyes in his heart resign her and all the world of love and joy she had opened on him today the revulsion when it did come was so strong that he hastily resolved to say nothing at home about the offered benefice the countess is so good thought he she has a hundred ways of aiding a young mans fortune she will not compel me to be a priest when she shall learn i love one of her sex one would almost think she does know it for she cast a strange look on me and said a priest gives up much too much i dare say she will give me a place about the palace and with this hopeful reflection his mind was eased and being now at the entrance of the banqueting hall he thanked his conductor and ran hastily with joyful eyes to margaret he came in sight of the tableshe was gone peter was gone too nobody was at the table at all only a citizen in sober garments had just tumbled under it dead drunk and several persons were raising him to carry him away gerard never guessed how important this solemn drunkard was to him he was looking for beauty and let the beast lie he ran wildly round the hall which was now comparatively empty she was not there he left the palace outside he found a crowd gaping at two great fanlights just lighted over the gate he asked them earnestly if they had seen an old man in a gown and a lovely girl pass out they laughed at the question they were staring at these new lights that turn night into day they didnt trouble their heads about old men and young wenches everyday sights from another group he learned there was a mystery being played under canvas hard by and all the world gone to see it this revived his hopes and he went and saw the mystery in this representation divine personages too sacred for me to name here came clumsily down from heaven to talk sophistry with the cardinal virtues the nine muses and the seven deadly sins all present in human shape and not unlike one another to enliven which weary stuff in rattled the prince of the power of the air and an imp that kept molesting him and buffeting him with a bladder at each thwack of which the crowd were in ecstasies when the vices had uttered good store of obscenity and the virtues twaddle the celestials including the nine muses went gingerly back to heaven one by one for there was but one cloud and two artisans worked it up with its supernatural freight and worked it down with a winch in full sight of the audience these disposed of the bottomless pit opened and flamed in the centre of the stage the carpenters and virtues shoved the vices in and the virtues and beelzebub and his tormentor danced merrily round the place of eternal torture to the fife and tabor this entertainment was writ by the bishop of ghent for the diffusion of religious sentiment by the aid of the senses and was an average specimen of theatrical exhibitions so long as they were in the hands of the clergy but in course of time the laity conducted plays and so the theatre i learn from the pulpit has become profane margaret was nowhere in the crowd and gerard could not enjoy the performance he actually went away in act in the midst of a muchadmired piece of dialogue in which justice outquibbled satan he walked through many streets but could not find her he sought at last fairly worn out he went to a hostelry and slept till daybreak all that day heavy and heartsick he sought her but could never fall in with her or her father nor ever obtain the slightest clue then he felt she was false or had changed her mind he was irritated now as well as sad more good fortune fell on him he almost hated it at last on the third day after he had once more been through every street he said she is not in the town and i shall never see her again i will go home he started for tergou with royal favour promised with fifteen golden angels in his purse a golden medal on his bosom and a heart like a lump of lead chapter iv it was near four oclock in the afternoon eli was in the shop his eldest and youngest sons were abroad catherine and her little crippled daughter had long been anxious about gerard and now they were gone a little way down the road to see if by good luck he might be visible in the distance and giles was alone in the sittingroom which i will sketch furniture and dwarf included the hollanders were always an original and leading people they claim to have invented printing wooden type oilpainting liberty banking gardening etc above all years before my tale they invented cleanliness so while the english gentry in velvet jerkins and chickentoed shoes trode floors of stale rushes foul receptacle of bones decomposing morsels spittle dogs eggs and all abominations this hosiers sittingroom at tergou was floored with dutch tiles so highly glazed and constantly washed that you could eat off them there was one large window the cross stonework in the centre of it was very massive and stood in relief looking like an actual cross to the inmates and was eyed as such in their devotions the panes were very small and lozengeshaped and soldered to one another with strips of lead the like you may see to this day in our rural cottages the chairs were rude and primitive all but the armchair whose back at right angles with its seat was so high that the sitters head stopped two feet short of the top this chair was of oak and carved at the summit there was a copper pail that went in at the waist holding holy water and a little handbesom to sprinkle it far and wide and a long narrow but massive oak table and a dwarf sticking to its rim by his teeth his eyes glaring and his claws in the air like a pouncing vampire nature it would seem did not make giles a dwarf out of malice prepense she constructed a head and torso with her usual care but just then her attention was distracted and she left the rest to chance the result was a human wedge an inverted cone he might justly have taken her to task in the terms of horace amphora coepit institui currente rota cur urceus exit his centre was anything but his centre of gravity bisected upper giles would have outweighed three lower giles but this very disproportion enabled him to do feats that would have baffled milo his brawny arms had no weight to draw after them so he could go up a vertical pole like a squirrel and hang for hours from a bough by one hand like a cherry by its stalk if he could have made a vacuum with his hands as the lizard is said to do with its feet he would have gone along a ceiling now this pocketathlete was insanely fond of gripping the dinnertable with both hands and so swinging and thenclimax of delight he would seize it with his teeth and taking off his hands hold on like grim death by his huge ivories but all our joys however elevating suffer interruption little kate caught sampsonet in this posture and stood aghast she was her mothers daughter and her heart was with the furniture not with the mo gymnast oh giles how can you mother is at hand it dents the table go and tell her little talebearer snarled giles you are the one for making mischief am i inquired kate calmly that is news to me the biggest in tergou growled giles fastening on again oh indeed said kate drily this piece of unwonted satire launched and giles not visibly blasted she sat down quietly and cried her mother came in almost at that moment and giles hurled himself under the table and there glared what is to do now said the dame sharply then turning her experienced eyes from kate to giles and observing the position he had taken up and a sheepish expression she hinted at cuffing of ears nay mother said the girl it was but a foolish word giles spoke i had not noticed it at another time but i was tired and in care for gerard you know let no one be in care for me said a faint voice at the door and in tottered gerard pale dusty and worn out and amidst uplifted hands and cries of delight curiosity and anxiety mingled dropped exhausted into the nearest chair beating rotterdam like a covert for margaret and the long journey afterwards had fairly knocked gerard up but elastic youth soon revived and behold him the centre of an eager circle first of all they must hear about the prizes then gerard told them he had been admitted to see the competitors works all laid out in an enormous hall before the judges pronounced oh mother oh kate when i saw the goldsmiths work i had liked to have fallen on the floor i thought not all the goldsmiths on earth had so much gold silver jewels and craft of design and facture but in sooth all the arts are divine then to please the females he described to them the reliquaries feretories calices crosiers crosses pyxes monstrances and other wonders ecclesiastical and the goblets hanaps watches clocks chains brooches c so that their mouths watered but kate when i came to the illuminated work from ghent and bruges my heart sank mine was dirt by the side of it for the first minute i could almost have cried but i prayed for a better spirit and presently i was able to enjoy them and thank god for those lovely works and for those skilful patient craftsmen whom i own my masters well the coloured work was so beautiful i forgot all about the black and white but next day when all the other prizes had been given they came to the writing and whose name think you was called first yours said kate the others laughed her to scorn you may well laugh said gerard but for all that gerard eliassoen of tergou was the name the herald shouted i stood stupid they thrust me forward everything swam before my eyes i found myself kneeling on a cushion at the feet of the duke he said something to me but i was so fluttered i could not answer him so then he put his hand to his side and did not draw a glaive and cut off my dull head but gave me a gold medal and there it is there was a yell and almost a scramble and then he gave me fifteen great bright golden angels i had seen one before but i never handled one here they are oh gerard oh gerard there is one for you our eldest and one for you sybrandt and for you little mischief and two for thee little lily because god hath afflicted thee and one for myself to buy colours and vellum and nine for her that nursed us all and risked the two crowns upon poor gerards hand the gold drew out their characters cornelis and sybrandt clutched each his coin with one glare of greediness and another glare of envy at kate who had got two pieces giles seized his and rolled it along the floor and gambolled after it kate put down her crutches and sat down and held out her little arms to gerard with a heavenly gesture of love and tenderness and the mother fairly benumbed at first by the shower of gold that fell on her apron now cried out leave kissing him kate he is my son not yours ah gerard my boy i have not loved you as you deserved then gerard threw himself on his knees beside her and she flung her arms round him and wept for joy and pride upon his neck good lad good lad cried the hosier with some emotion i must go and tell the neighbours lend me the medal gerard ill show it my good friend peter buyskens he is ever regaling me with how his son jorian won the tin mug a shooting at the butts ay do my man and show peter buyskens one of the angels tell him there are fourteen more where that came from mind you bring it me back stay a minute father there is better news behind said gerard flushing with joy at the joy he caused better better than this then gerard told his interview with the countess and the house rang with joy now god bless the good lady and bless the dame van eyck a benefice our son my cares are at an end eli my good friend and master now we two can die happy whenever our time comes this dear boy will take our place and none of these loved ones will want a home or a friend from that hour gerard was looked upon as the stay of the family he was a son apart but in another sense he was always in the right and nothing too good for him cornelis and sybrandt became more and more jealous of him and longed for the day he should go to his benefice they would get rid of the favourite and his reverences purse would be open to them with these views he cooperated the wound love had given him throbbed duller and duller his success and the affection and admiration of his parents made him think more highly of himself and resent with more spirit margarets ingratitude and discourtesy for all that she had power to cool him towards the rest of her sex and now for every reason he wished to be ordained priest as soon as he could pass the intermediate orders he knew the vulgate already better than most of the clergy and studied the rubric and the dogmas of the church with his friends the monks and the first time the bishop came that way he applied to be admitted exorcist the third step in holy orders the bishop questioned him and ordained him at once he had to kneel and after a short prayer the bishop delivered to him a little ms full of exorcisms and said take this gerard and have power to lay hands on the possessed whether baptized or catechumens and he took it reverently and went home invested by the church with power to cast out demons returning home from the church he was met by little kate on her crutches oh gerard who think you hath sent to our house seeking youthe burgomaster himself ghysbrecht van swieten what would he with me nay gerard i know not but he seems urgent to see you you are to go to his house on the instant well he is the burgomaster i will go but it likes me not kate i have seen him cast such a look on me as no friend casts no matter such looks forewarn the wise to be sure he knows knows what gerard nothing nothing kate ill go chapter v ghysbrecht van swieten was an artful man he opened on the novice with something quite wide of the mark he was really aiming at the town records said he are crabbedly written and the ink rusty with age he offered gerard the honour of transcribing them fair gerard inquired what he was to be paid ghysbrecht offered a sum that would have just purchased the pens ink and parchment but burgomaster my labour here is a years work your labour call you marking parchment labour little sweat goes to that i trow tis labour and skilled labour to boot and that is better paid in all crafts than rude labour sweat or no sweat besides theres my time your time why what is time to you at twoandtwenty then fixing his eyes keenly on gerard to mark the effect of his words he said say rather you are idle grown you are in love your body is with these chanting monks but your heart is with peter brandt and his redhaired girl i know no peter brandt this denial confirmed ghysbrechts suspicion that the casterout of demons was playing a deep game ye lie he shouted did i not find you at her elbow on the road to rotterdam ah ah and you were seen at sevenbergen but tother day was i ah and at peters house at sevenbergen ay at sevenbergen now this was what in modern days is called a draw it was a guess put boldly forth as fact to elicit by the young mans answer whether he had been there lately or not the result of the artifice surprised the crafty one gerard started up in a strange state of nervous excitement burgomaster said he with trembling voice i have not been at sevenbergen these three years and i know not the name of those you saw me with nor where they dwelt but as my time is precious though you value it not give you good day and he darted out with his eyes sparkling ghysbrecht started up in huge ire but he sank into his chair again he fears me not he knows something if not all then he called hastily to his trusty servant and almost dragged him to a window see you yon man he cried haste follow him but let him not see you he is young but old in craft keep him in sight all day let me know whither he goes and what he does it was night when the servant returned well well cried van swieten eagerly master the young man went from you to sevenbergen ghysbrecht groaned to the house of peter the magician chapter vi look into your own heart and write said herr cant and earths cuckoos echoed the cry look into the rhine where it is deepest and the thames where it is thickest and paint the bottom lower a bucket into a well of selfdeception and what comes up must be immortal truth mustnt it now in the first place no son of adam ever reads his own heart at all except by the habit acquired and the light gained from some years perusal of other hearts and even then with his acquired sagacity and reflected light he can but spell and decipher his own heart not read it fluently half way to sevenbergen gerard looked into his own heart and asked it why he was going to sevenbergen his heart replied without a moments hesitation we are going out of curiosity to know why she jilted us and to show her it has not broken our hearts and that we are quite content with our honours and our benefice in prospectu and dont want her nor ally of her fickle sex he soon found out peter brandts cottage and there sat a girl in the doorway plying her needle and a stalwart figure leaned on a long bow and talked to her gerard felt an unaccountable pang at the sight of him however the man turned out to be past fifty years of age an old soldier whom gerard remembered to have seen shoot at the butts with admirable force and skill another minute and the youth stood before them margaret looked up and dropped her work and uttered a faint cry and was white and red by turns but these signs of emotion were swiftly dismissed and she turned far more chill and indifferent than she would if she had not betrayed this agitation what is it you master gerard what on earth brings you here i wonder i was passing by and saw you so i thought i would give you good day and ask after your father my father is well he will be here anon then i may as well stay till he comes as you will good martin step into the village and tell my father here is a friend of his and not of yours my fathers friends are mine that is doubtful it was not like a friend to promise to wait for me and then make off the moment my back was turned cruel margaret you little know how i searched the town for you how for want of you nothing was pleasant to me these are idle words if you had desired my fathers company or mine you would have come back there i had a bed laid for you sir at my cousins and he would have made much of you and who knows i might have made much of you too i was in the humour that day you will not catch me in the same mind again neither you nor any young man i warrant me margaret i came back the moment the countess let me go but you were not there nay you did not or you had seen hans cloterman at our table we left him to bring you on i saw no one there but only a drunken man that had just tumbled down at our table how was he clad nay i took little heed in sadcoloured garb at this margarets face gradually warmed but presently assuming incredulity and severity she put many shrewd questions all of which gerard answered most loyally finally the clouds cleared and they guessed how the misunderstanding had come about then came a revulsion of tenderness all the more powerful that they had done each other wrong and then more dangerous still came mutual confessions neither had been happy since neither ever would have been happy but for this fortunate meeting and gerard found a ms vulgate lying open on the table and pounced upon it like a hawk mss were his delight but before he could get to it two white hands quickly came flat upon the page and a red face over them nay take away your hands margaret that i may see where you are reading and i will read there too at home so shall my soul meet yours in the sacred page you will not nay then i must kiss them away and he kissed them so often that for very shame they were fain to withdraw and lo the sacred book lay open at an apple of gold in a network of silver there now said she i had been hunting for it ever so long and found it but even nowand to be caught and with a touch of inconsistency she pointed it out to gerard with her white finger ay said he but today it is all hidden in that great cap it is a comely cap im told by some maybe but what it hides is beautiful it is not it is hideous well it was beautiful at rotterdam ay everything was beautiful that day with a little sigh and now peter came in and welcomed gerard cordially and would have him to stay supper and margaret disappeared and gerard had a nice learned chat with peter and margaret reappeared with her hair in her silver net and shot a glance half arch half coy and glided about them and spread supper and beamed bright with gaiety and happiness and in the cool evening gerard coaxed her out and she objected and came and coaxed her on to the road to tergou and she declined and came and there they strolled up and down hand in hand and when he must go they pledged each other never to quarrel or misunderstand one another again and they sealed the promise with a long loving kiss and gerard went home on wings from that day gerard spent most of his evenings with margaret and the attachment deepened and deepened on both sides till the hours they spent together were the hours they lived the rest they counted and underwent and at the outset of this deep attachment all went smoothly obstacles there were but they seemed distant and small to the eyes of hope youth and love the feelings and passions of so many persons that this attachment would thwart gave no warning smoke to show their volcanic nature and power the course of true love ran smoothly placidly until it had drawn these two young hearts into its current for ever and then chapter vii one bright morning unwonted velvet shone unwonted feathers waved and horses hoofs glinted and ran through the streets of tergou and the windows and balconies were studded with wondering faces the french ambassador was riding through to sport in the neighbouring forest besides his own suite he was attended by several servants of the duke of burgundy lent to do him honour and minister to his pleasure the dukes tumbler rode before him with a grave sedate majesty that made his more noble companions seem light frivolous persons but ever and anon when respect and awe neared the oppressive he rolled off his horse so ignobly and funnily that even the ambassador was fain to burst out laughing he also climbed up again by the tail in a way provocative of mirth and so he played his part towards the rear of the pageant rode one that excited more attention stillthe dukes leopard a huntsman mounted on a flemish horse of giant prodigious size and power carried a long box fastened to the riders loins by straps curiously contrived and on this box sat a bright leopard crouching she was chained to the huntsman the people admired her glossy hide and spots and pressed near and one or two were for feeling her and pulling her tail then the huntsman shouted in a terrible voice beware at antwerp one did but throw a handful of dust at her and the duke made dust of him gramercy i speak sooth the good duke shut him up in prison in a cell under ground and the rats cleaned the flesh off his bones in a night served him right for molesting the poor thing there was a murmur of fear and the tergovians shrank from tickling the leopard of their sovereign but an incident followed that raised their spirits again the dukes giant a hungarian seven feet four inches high brought up the rear this enormous creature had like some other giants a treble fluty voice of little power he was a vain fellow and not conscious of this nor any defect now it happened he caught sight of giles sitting on the top of the balcony so he stopped and began to make fun of him hallo brother squeaked he i had nearly passed without seeing thee you are plain enough to see bellowed giles in his bass tones come on my shoulder brother squeaked titan and held out a shoulder of mutton fist to help him down if i do ill cuff your ears roared the dwarf the giant saw the homuncule was irascible and played upon him being encouraged thereto by the shouts of laughter for he did not see that the people were laughing not at his wit but at the ridiculous incongruity of the two voicesthe gigantic feeble fife and the petty deep loud drum the mountain delivered of a squeak and the molehill belching thunder the singular duet came to as singular an end giles lost all patience and selfcommand and being a creature devoid of fear and in a rage to boot he actually dropped upon the giants neck seized his hair with one hand and punched his head with the other the giants first impulse was to laugh but the weight and rapidity of the blows soon corrected that inclination he he ah ha hallo oh oh holy saints here help or i must throttle the imp i cant ill split your skull against the and he made a wild run backwards at the balcony giles saw his danger seized the balcony in time with both hands and whipped over it just as the giants head came against it with a stunning crack the people roared with laughter and exultation at the address of their little champion the indignant giant seized two of the laughers knocked them together like dumbbells shook them and strewed them flatcatherine shrieked and threw her apron over gilesthen strode wrathfully away after the party this incident had consequences no one then present foresaw its immediate results were agreeable the tergovians turned proud of giles and listened with more affability to his prayers for parchment for he drove a regular trade with his brother gerard in this article went about and begged it gratis and gerard gave him coppers for it on the afternoon of the same day catherine and her daughter were chatting together about their favourite theme gerard his goodness his benefice and the brightened prospects of the whole family their good luck had come to them in the very shape they would have chosen besides the advantages of a benefice such as the countess charolois would not disdain to give there was the feminine delight at having a priest a holy man in their own family he will marry cornelis and sybrandt for they can wed good housewives now if they will gerard will take care of you and giles when we are gone yes mother and we can confess to him instead of to a stranger said kate ay girl and he can give the sacred oil to your father and me and close our eyes when our time comes oh mother not for many many years i do pray heaven pray speak not of that it always makes me sad i hope to go before you mother dear no let us be gay today i am out of pain mother quite out of all pain it does seem so strange and i feel so bright and happy thatmother can you keep a secret nobody better child why you know i can then i will show you something so beautiful you never saw the like i trow only gerard must never know for sure he means to surprise us with it he covers it up so and sometimes he carries it away altogether kate took her crutches and moved slowly away leaving her mother in an exalted state of curiosity she soon returned with something in a cloth uncovered it and there was a lovely picture of the virgin with all her insignia and wearing her tiara over a wealth of beautiful hair which flowed loose over her shoulders catherine at first was struck with awe it is herself she cried it is the queen of heaven i never saw one like her to my mind before and her eyes mother lifted to the sky as if they belonged there and not to a mortal creature and her beautiful hair of burning gold and to think i have a son that can make the saints live again upon a piece of wood the reason is he is a young saint himself mother he is too good for this world he is here to portray the blessed and then to go away and be with them for ever ere they had half done admiring it a strange voice was heard at the door by one of the furtive instincts of their sex they hastily hid the picture in the cloth though there was no need and the next moment in came casting his eyes furtively around a man that had not entered the house this ten years ghysbrecht van swieten the two women were so taken by surprise that they merely stared at him and at one another and said the burgomaster in a tone so expressive that ghysbrecht felt compelled to answer it yes i own the last time i came here was not on a friendly errand men love their own interestelis and mine were contrary well let this visit atone the last today i come on your business and none of mine catherine and her daughter exchanged a swift glance of contemptuous incredulity they knew the man better than he thought it is about your son gerard ay ay you want him to work for the town all for nothing he told us i come on no such errand it is to let you know he has fallen into bad hands now heaven and the saints forbid man torture not a mother speak out and quickly speak ere you have time to coin falsehood we know thee ghysbrecht turned pale at this affront and spite mingled with the other motives that brought him here thus it is then said he grinding his teeth and speaking very fast your son gerard is more like to be father of a family than a priest he is for ever with margaret peter brandts redhaired girl and loves her like a cow her calf mother and daughter both burst out laughing ghysbrecht stared at them what you knew it carry this tale to those who know not my son gerard women are nought to him other women mayhap but this one is the apple of his eye to him or will be if you part them not and soon come dame make me not waste time and friendly counsel my servant has seen them together a score times handed and reading babies in one anothers eyes likeyou know dameyou have been young too girl i am ill at ease yea i have been young and know how blind and foolish the young are my heart he has turned me sick in a moment kate if it should be true nay nay cried kate eagerly gerard might love a young woman all young men do i cant find what they see in them to love so but if he did he would let us know he would not deceive us you wicked man no dear mother look not so gerard is too good to love a creature of earth his love is for our lady and the saints ah i will show you the picture there if his heart was earthly could he paint the queen of heaven like thatlook look and she held the picture out triumphantly and more radiant and beautiful in this moment of enthusiasm than ever dead picture was or will be overpowered the burgomaster with her eloquence and her feminine proof of gerards purity his eyes and mouth opened and remained open in which state they kept turning face and all as if on a pivot from the picture to the women and from the women to the picture why it is herself he gasped isnt it cried kate and her hostility was softened you admire it i forgive you for frightening us am i in a madhouse said ghysbrecht van swieten thoroughly puzzled you show me a picture of the girl and you say he painted it and that is a proof he cannot love her why they all paint their sweethearts painters do a picture of the girl exclaimed kate shocked fie this is no girl this is our blessed lady no no it is margaret brandt oh blind it is the queen of heaven no only of sevenbergen village profane man behold her crown silly child look at her red hair would the virgin be seen in red hair she who had the pick of all the colours ten thousand years before the world began at this moment an anxious face was insinuated round the edge of the open door it was their neighbour peter buyskens what is to do said he in a cautious whisper we can hear you all across the street what on earth is to do oh neighbour what is to do why here is the burgomaster blackening our gerard stop cried van swieten peter buyskens is come in the nick of time he knows father and daughter both they cast their glamour on him what is she a witch too else the egg takes not after the bird why is her father called the magician i tell you they bewitched this very peter here they cast unholy spells on him and cured him of the colic now peter look and tell me who is that and you be silent women for a moment if you can who is it peter well to be sure said peter in reply and his eye seemed fascinated by the picture who is it repeated ghysbrecht impetuously peter buyskens smiled why you know as well as i do but what have they put a crown on her for i never saw her in a crown for my part man alive cant you open your great jaws and just speak a wenchs name plain out to oblige three people id do a great deal more to oblige one of you than that burgomaster if it isnt as natural as life curse the man he wont he wontcurse him why what have i done now oh sir said little kate for pitys sake tell us are these the features of a living woman ofofmargaret brandt a mirror is not truer my little maid but is it she sir for very certain why who else should it be now why couldnt you say so at once snarled ghysbrecht i did say so as plain as i could speak snapped peter and they growled over this small bone of contention so zealously that they did not see catherine and her daughter had thrown their aprons over their heads and were rocking to and fro in deep distress the next moment elias came in from the shop and stood aghast catherine though her face was covered knew his footstep that is my poor man she sobbed tell him good peter buyskens for i have not the courage elias turned pale the presence of the burgomaster in his house after so many years of coolness coupled with his wifes and daughters distress made him fear some heavy misfortune richart jacob he gasped no no said the burgomaster it is nearer home and nobody is dead or dying old friend god bless you burgomaster ah something has gone off my breast that was like to choke me now what is the matter ghysbrecht then told him all that he told the women and showed the picture in evidence is that all said eli profoundly relieved what are ye roaring and bellowing for it is vexingit is angering but it is not like death not even sickness boys will be boys he will outgrow that disease tis but skindeep but when ghysbrecht told him that margaret was a girl of good character that it was not to be supposed she would be so intimate if marriage had not been spoken of between them his brow darkened marriage that shall never be said he sternly ill stay that ay by force if need beas i would his hand lifted to cut his throat id do what old john koestein did tother day and what is that in heavens name asked the mother suddenly removing her apron it was the burgomaster who replied he made me shut young albert koestein up in the prison of the stadthouse till he knocked under it was not long fortyeight hours all alone on bread and water cooled his hot stomach tell my father i am his humble servant says he and let me into the sun once morethe sun is worth all the wenches in the world oh the cruelty of men sighed catherine as to that the burgomaster has no choice it is the law and if a father says burgomaster lock up my son he must do it a fine thing it would be if a father might not lock up his own son well well it wont come to that with me and my son he never disobeyed me in his life he never shall where is he it is past suppertime where is he kate alas i know not father i know said ghysbrecht he is at sevenbergen my servant met him on the road supper passed in gloomy silence evening descendedno gerard eight oclock cameno gerard then the father sent all to bed except catherine you and i will walk abroad wife and talk over this new care abroad my man at this time whither why on the road to sevenbergen oh no no hasty words father poor gerard he never vexed you before fear me not but it must end and i am not one that trusts tomorrow with todays work the old pair walked hand in hand for strange is it may appear to some of my readers the use of the elbow to couples walking was not discovered in europe till centuries after this they sauntered on a long time in silence the night was clear and balmy such nights calm and silent recall the past from the dead it is a many years since we walked so late my man said catherine softly ay sweetheart more than we shall see again is he never coming i wonder not since our courting days eli no ay you were a buxom lass then and you were a comely lad as ever a girls eye stole a look at i do suppose gerard is with her now as you used to be with me nature is strong and the same in all our generations nay i hope he has left her by now confound her or we shall be here all night eli well kate i have been happy with you sweetheart for all our rubsmuch happier i trow than if i hadbeenaanun you wont speak harshly to the poor child one can be firm without being harsh surely have you been happy with me my poor eli why you know i have friends i have known but none like thee buss me wife a heart to share joy and grief with is a great comfort to man or woman isnt it eli it is so my lass it doth joy double and halveth trouble runs the byword and so i have found it sweetheart ah here comes the young fool catherine trembled and held her husbands hand tight the moon was bright but they were in the shadow of some trees and their son did not see them he came singing in the moonlight and his face shining chapter viii while the burgomaster was exposing gerard at tergou margaret had a trouble of her own at sevenbergen it was a housewifes distress but deeper than we can well conceive she came to martin wittenhaagen the old soldier with tears in her eyes martin theres nothing in the house and gerard is coming and he is so thoughtless he forgets to sup at home when he gives over work then he runs to me straight poor soul and often he comes quite faint and to think i have nothing to set before my servant that loves me so dear martin scratched his head what can i do it is thursday it is your day to shoot sooth to say i counted on you today nay said the soldier i may not shoot when the duke or his friends are at the chase read else i am no scholar and he took out of his pouch a parchment with a grand seal it purported to be a stipend and a licence given by philip duke of burgundy to martin wittenhaagen one of his archers in return for services in the wars and for a wound received at the dukes side the stipend was four merks yearly to be paid by the dukes almoner and the licence was to shoot three arrows once a week viz on thursday and no other day in any of the dukes forests in holland at any game but a sevenyearold buck or a doe carrying fawn proviso that the duke should not be hunting on that day or any of his friends in this case martin was not to go and disturb the woods on peril of his salary and his head and a fine of a penny margaret sighed and was silent come cheer up mistress said he for your sake ill peril my carcass i have done that for many a one that was not worth your forefinger it is no such mighty risk either ill but step into the skirts of the forest here it is odds but they drive a hare or a fawn within reach of my arrow well if i let you go you must promise me not to go far and not to be seen far better gerard went supperless than ill should come to you faithful martin the required promise given martin took his bow and three arrows and stole cautiously into the wood it was scarce a furlong distant the horns were heard faintly in the distance and all the game was afoot come thought martin i shall soon fill the pot and no one be the wiser he took his stand behind a thick oak that commanded a view of an open glade and strung his bow a truly formidable weapon it was of english yew six feet two inches high and thick in proportion and martin broadchested with arms all iron and cord and used to the bow from infancy could draw a threefoot arrow to the head and when it flew the eye could scarce follow it and the bowstring twanged as musical as a harp this bow had laid many a stout soldier low in the wars of the hoecks and cabbeljaws in those days a battlefield was not a cloud of smoke the combatants were few but the deaths manyfor they saw what they were about and fewer bloodless arrows flew than bloodless bullets now a hare came cantering then sat sprightly and her ears made a capital v martin levelled his tremendous weapon at her the arrow flew the string twanged but martin had been in a hurry to pot her and lost her by an inch the arrow seemed to hit her but it struck the ground close to her and passed under her belly like a flash and hissed along the short grass and disappeared she jumped three feet perpendicular and away at the top of her speed bungler said martin a sure proof he was not an habitual bungler or he would have blamed the hare he had scarcely fitted another arrow to his string when a woodpigeon settled on the very tree he stood under aha thought he you are small but dainty this time he took more pains drew his arrow carefully loosed it smoothly and saw it to all appearance go clean through the bird carrying feathers skyward like dust instead of falling at his feet the bird whose breast was torn not fairly pierced fluttered feebly away and by a great effort rose above the trees flew some fifty yards and dead at last but where he could not see for the thick foliage luck is against me said he despondingly but he fitted another arrow and eyed the glade keenly presently he heard a bustle behind him and turned round just in time to see a noble buck cross the open but too late to shoot at him he dashed his bow down with an imprecation at that moment a long spotted animal glided swiftly across after the deer its belly seemed to touch the ground as it went martin took up his bow hastily he recognized the dukes leopard the hunters will not be far from her said he and i must not be seen gerard must go supperless this night he plunged into the wood following the buck and leopard for that was his way home he had not gone far when he heard an unusual sound ahead of himleaves rustling violently and the ground trampled he hurried in the direction he found the leopard on the bucks back tearing him with teeth and claw and the buck running in a circle and bounding convulsively with the blood pouring down his hide then martin formed a desperate resolution to have the venison for margaret he drew his arrow to the head and buried it in the deer who spite of the creature on his back bounded high into the air and fell dead the leopard went on tearing him as if nothing had happened martin hoped that the creature would gorge itself with blood and then let him take the meat he waited some minutes then walked resolutely up and laid his hand on the bucks leg the leopard gave a frightful growl and left off sucking blood she saw martins game and was sulky and on her guard what was to be done martin had heard that wild creatures cannot stand the human eye accordingly he stood erect and fixed his on the leopard the leopard returned a savage glance and never took her eye off martin then martin continuing to look the beast down the leopard brutally ignorant of natural history flew at his head with a frightful yell flaming eyes and jaws and distended he had but just time to catch her by the throat before her teeth could crush his face one of her claws seized his shoulder and rent it the other aimed at his cheek would have been more deadly still but martin was oldfashioned and wore no hat but a scapulary of the same stuff as his jerkin and this scapulary he had brought over his head like a hood the brutes claw caught in the loose leather martin kept her teeth off his face with great difficulty and griped her throat fiercely and she kept rending his shoulder it was like blunt reapinghooks grinding and tearing the pain was fearful but instead of cowing the old soldier it put his blood up and he gnashed his teeth with rage almost as fierce as hers and squeezed her neck with iron force the two pair of eyes flared at one anotherand now the mans were almost as furious as the brutes she found he was throttling her and made a wild attempt to free herself in which she dragged his cowl all over his face and blinded him and tore her claw out of his shoulder flesh and all but still he throttled her with hand and arm of iron presently her long tail that was high in the air went down aha cried martin joyfully and gripped her like death next her body lost its elasticity and he held a choked and powerless thing he gripped it still till all motion ceased then dashed it to the earth then panting removed his cowl the leopard lay mute at his feet with tongue protruding and bloody paw and for the first time terror fell on martin i am a dead man i have slain the dukes leopard he hastily seized a few handfuls of leaves and threw them over her then shouldered the buck and staggered away leaving a trail of blood all the way his own and the bucks he burst into peters house a horrible figure bleeding and bloodstained and flung the deers carcass down thereno questions said he but broil me a steak ont for i am faint margaret did not see he was wounded she thought the blood was all from the deer she busied herself at the fire and the stout soldier stanched and bound his own wound apart and soon he and gerard and margaret were supping royally on broiled venison they were very merry and gerard with wonderful thoughtfulness had brought a flask of schiedam and under its influence martin revived and told them how the venison was got and they all made merry over the exploit their mirth was strangely interrupted margarets eye became fixed and fascinated and her cheek pale with fear she gasped and could not speak but pointed to the window with trembling finger their eyes followed hers and there in the twilight crouched a dark form with eyes like glowworms it was the leopard while they stood petrified fascinated by the eyes of green fire there sounded in the wood a single deep bay martin trembled at it they have lost her and laid muzzled bloodhounds on her scent they will find her here and the venison goodbye friends martin wittenhaagen ends here gerard seized his bow and put it into the soldiers hands be a man he cried shoot her and fling her into the wood ere they come up who will know more voices of hounds broke out and nearer curse her cried martin i spared her once now she must die or i or both more likely and he reared his bow and drew his arrow to the head nay nay cried margaret and seized the arrow it broke in half the pieces fell on each side the bow the air at the same time filled with the tongues of the hounds they were hot upon the scent what have you done wench you have put the halter round my throat no cried margaret i have saved you stand back from the window both your knife quick she seized his longpointed knife almost tore it out of his girdle and darted from the room the house was now surrounded with baying dogs and shouting men the glowworm eyes moved not chapter ix margaret cut off a huge piece of venison and ran to the window and threw it out to the green eyes of fire they darted on to it with a savage snarl and there was a sound of rending and crunching at this moment a hound uttered a bay so near and loud it rang through the house and the three at the window shrank together then the leopard feared for her supper and glided swiftly and stealthily away with it towards the woods and the very next moment horses and men and dogs came helterskelter past the window and followed her full cry martin and his companions breathed again the leopard was swift and would not be caught within a league of their house they grasped hands margaret seized this opportunity and cried a little gerard kissed the tears away to table once more and gerard drank to womans wit tis stronger than mans force said he ay said margaret when those she loves are in danger not else tonight gerard stayed with her longer than usual and went home prouder than ever of her and happy as a prince some little distance from home under the shadow of some trees he encountered two figures they almost barred his way it was his father and mother out so late what could be the cause a chill fell on him he stopped and looked at them they stood grim and silent he stammered out some words of inquiry why ask said the father you know why we are here oh gerard said his mother with a voice full of reproach yet of affection gerards heart quaked he was silent then his father pitied his confusion and said to him nay you need not to hang your head you are not the first young fool that has been caught by a red cheek and a pair of blue eyes nay nay put in catherine it was witchcraft peter the magician is well known for that come sir priest resumed his father you know you must not meddle with women folk but give us your promise to go no more to sevenbergen and here all ends we wont be hard on you for one fault i cannot promise that father not promise it you young hypocrite nay father miscall me not i lacked courage to tell you what i knew would vex you and right grateful am i to that good friend whoever he be that has let you wot tis a load off my mind yes father i love margaret and call me not a priest for a priest i will never be i will die sooner that we shall see young man come gainsay me no more you will learn what tis to disrespect a father gerard held his peace and the three walked home in gloomy silence broken only by a deep sigh or two from catherine from that hour the little house at tergou was no longer the abode of peace gerard was taken to task next day before the whole family and every voice was loud against him except little kates and the dwarfs who was apt to take his cue from her without knowing why as for cornelis and sybrandt they were bitterer than their father gerard was dismayed at finding so many enemies and looked wistfully into his little sisters face her eyes were brimming at the harsh words showered on one who but yesterday was the universal pet but she gave him no encouragement she turned her head away from him and said dear dear gerard pray to heaven to cure you of this folly what are you against me too said gerard sadly and he rose with a deep sigh and left the house and went to sevenbergen the beginning of a quarrel where the parties are bound by affection though opposed in interest and sentiment is comparatively innocent both are perhaps in the right at first starting and then it is that a calm judicious friend capable of seeing both sides is a gift from heaven for the longer the dissension endures the wider and deeper it grows by the fallibility and irascibility of human nature these are not confined to either side and finally the invariable end is reachedboth in the wrong the combatants were unequally matched elias was angry cornelis and sybrandt spiteful but gerard having a larger and more cultivated mind saw both sides where they saw but one and had fits of irresolution and was not wroth but unhappy he was lonely too in this struggle he could open his heart to no one margaret was a highspirited girl he dared not tell her what he had to endure at home she was capable of siding with his relations by resigning him though at the cost of her own happiness margaret van eyck had been a great comfort to him on another occasion but now he dared not make her his confidant her own history was well known in early life she had many offers of marriage but refused them all for the sake of that art to which a wifes and mothers duties are so fatal thus she remained single and painted with her brothers how could he tell her that he declined the benefice she had got him and declined it for the sake of that which at his age she had despised and sacrificed so lightly gerard at this period bade fair to succumb but the other side had a horrible ally in catherine senior this goodhearted but uneducated woman could not like her daughter act quietly and firmly still less could she act upon a plan she irritated gerard at times and so helped him for anger is a great sustainer of the courage at others she turned round in a moment and made onslaughts on her own forces to take a single instance out of many one day that they were all at home catherine and all cornelis said our gerard wed margaret brandt why it is hunger marrying thirst and what will it be when you marry cried catherine gerard can paint gerard can write but what can you do to keep a woman ye lazy loon nought but wait for your fathers shoon oh we can see why you and sybrandt would not have the poor boy to marry you are afraid he will come to us for a share of our substance and say that he does and say that we give it him it isnt yourn we part from and mayhap never will be on these occasions gerard smiled slily and picked up heart and temporary confusion fell on catherines unfortunate allies but at last after more than six months of irritation came the climax the father told the son before the whole family he had ordered the burgomaster to imprison him in the stadthouse rather than let him marry margaret gerard turned pale with anger at this but by a great effort held his peace his father went on to say and a priest you shall be before the year is out nillywilly is it so cried gerard then hear me all by god and st bavon i swear i will never be a priest while margaret lives since force is to decide it and not love and duty try force father but force shall not serve you for the day i see the burgomaster come for me i leave tergou for ever and holland too and my fathers house where it seems i have been valued all these years not for myself but for what is to be got out of me and he flung out of the room white with anger and desperation there cried catherine that comes of driving young folks too hard but men are crueller than tigers even to their own flesh and blood now heaven forbid he should ever leave us married or single as gerard came out of the house his cheeks pale and his heart panting he met reicht heynes she had a message for him margaret van eyck desired to see him he found the old lady seated grim as a judge she wasted no time in preliminaries but inquired coldly why he had not visited her of late before he could answer she said in a sarcastic tone i thought we had been friends young sir at this gerard looked the picture of doubt and consternation it is because you never told her you were in love said reicht heynes pitying his confusion silence wench why should he tell us his affairs we are not his friends we have not deserved his confidence alas my second mother said gerard i did not dare to tell you my folly what folly is it folly to love i am told so every day of my life you need not have been afraid to tell my mistress she is always kind to true lovers madamreicht i was afraid because i was told well you were told that in your youth you scorned love preferring art i did boy and what is the end of it behold me here a barren stock while the women of my youth have a troop of children at their side and grandchildren at their knee i gave up the sweet joys of wifehood and motherhood for what for my dear brothers they have gone and left me long ago for my art it has all but left me too i have the knowledge still but what avails that when the hand trembles no gerard i look on you as my son you are good you are handsome you are a painter though not like some i have known i will not let you throw your youth away as i did mine you shall marry this margaret i have inquired and she is a good daughter reicht here is a gossip she has told me all about it but that need not hinder you to tell me poor gerard was overjoyed to be permitted to praise margaret aloud and to one who could understand what he loved in her soon there were two pair of wet eyes over his story and when the poor boy saw that there were three women are creatures brimful of courage theirs is not exactly the same quality as manly courage that would never do hang it all we should have to give up trampling on them no it is a vicarious courage they never take part in a bullfight by any chance but it is remarked that they sit at one unshaken by those tremors and apprehensions for the combatants to which the male spectatorfeebleminded wretchis subject nothing can exceed the resolution with which they have been known to send forth men to battle as some witty dog says les femmes sont tres braves avec le peur dautrui by this trait gerard now profited margaret and reicht were agreed that a man should always take the bull by the horns gerards only course was to marry margaret brandt offhand the old people would come to after a while the deed once done whereas the longer this misunderstanding continued on its present footing the worse for all parties especially for gerard see how pale and thin they have made him amongst them indeed you are master gerard said reicht it makes a body sad to see a young man so wasted and worn mistress when i met him in the street today i had liked to have burst out crying he was so changed and ill be bound the others keep their colour ah reicht such as it is oh i see no odds in them of course not we painters are no match for boors we are glass they are stone we cant stand the worry worry worry of little minds and it is not for the good of mankind we should be exposed to it it is hard enough heaven knows to design and paint a masterpiece without having gnats and flies stinging us to death into the bargain exasperated as gerard was by his fathers threat of violence he listened to these friendly voices telling him the prudent course was rebellion but though he listened he was not convinced i do not fear my fathers violence he said but i do fear his anger when it came to the point he would not imprison me i would marry margaret tomorrow if that was my only fear no he would disown me i should take margaret from her father and give her a poor husband who would never thrive weighed down by his parents curse madam i sometimes think if i could marry her secretly and then take her away to some country where my craft is better paid than in this and after a year or two when the storm had blown over you know could come back with money in my purse and say my dear parents we do not seek your substance we but ask you to love us once more as you used and as we have never ceased to love youbut alas i shall be told these are the dreams of an inexperienced young man the old ladys eyes sparkled it is no dream but a piece of wonderful commonsense in a boy it remains to be seen whether you have spirit to carry out your own thought there is a country gerard where certain fortune awaits you at this moment here the arts freeze but there they flourish as they never yet flourished in any age or land it is italy cried gerard it is italy ay italy where painters are honoured like princes and scribes are paid three hundred crowns for copying a single manuscript know you not that his holiness the pope has written to every land for skilful scribes to copy the hundreds of precious manuscripts that are pouring into that favoured land from constantinople whence learning and learned men are driven by the barbarian turks nay i know not that but it has been the dream and hope of my life to visit italy the queen of all the arts oh madam but the journey and we are all so poor find you the heart to go ill find the means i know where to lay my hand on ten golden angels they will take you to rome and the girl with you if she loves you as she ought they sat till midnight over this theme and after that day gerard recovered his spirits and seemed to carry a secret talisman against all the gibes and the harsh words that flew about his ears at home besides the money she procured him for the journey margaret van eyck gave him moneys worth said she i will tell you secrets that i learned from masters that are gone from me and have left no fellow behind even the italians know them not and what i tell you now in tergou you shall sell here in florence note my brother jans pictures time which fades all other paintings leaves his colours bright as the day they left the easel the reason is he did nothing blindly in a hurry he trusted to no hireling to grind his colours he did it himself or saw it done his panel was prepared and prepared againi will show you howa year before he laid his colour on most of them are quite content to have their work sucked up and lost sooner than not be in a hurry bad painters are always in a hurry above all gerard i warn you use but little oil and never boil it boiling it melts that vegetable dross into its heart which it is our business to clear away for impure oil is death to colour no take your oil and pour it into a bottle with water in a day or two the water will turn muddy that is muck from the oil pour the dirty water carefully away and add fresh when that is poured away you will fancy the oil is clear youre mistaken reicht fetch me that reicht brought a glass trough with a glass lid fitting tight when your oil has been washed in bottle put it into this trough with water and put the trough in the sun all day you will soon see the water turbid again but mark you must not carry this game too far or the sun will turn your oil to varnish when it is as clear as crystal not too luscious drain carefully and cork it up tight grind your own prime colours and lay them on with this oil and they shall live hubert would put sand or salt in the water to clear the oil quicker but jan used to say water will do it best give water time jan van eyck was never in a hurry and that is why the world will not forget him in a hurry this and several other receipts quae nunc perscribere longum est margaret gave him with sparkling eyes and gerard received them like a legacy from heaven so interesting are some things that read uninteresting thus provided with money and knowledge gerard decided to marry and fly with his wife to italy nothing remained now but to inform margaret brandt of his resolution and to publish the banns as quietly as possible he went to sevenbergen earlier than usual on both these errands he began with margaret told her of the dame van eycks goodness and the resolution he had come to at last and invited her cooperation she refused it plump no gerard you and i have never spoken of your family but when you come to marriage she stopped then began again i do think your father has no illwill to me more than to another he told peter buyskens as much and peter told me but so long as he is bent on your being a priest you ought have told me this instead of i you i could not marry you gerard dearly as i love you gerard strove in vain to shake this resolution he found it very easy to make her cry but impossible to make her yield then gerard was impatient and unjust very well he cried then you are on their side and you will drive me to be a priest for this must end one way or another my parents hate me in earnest but my lover only loves me in jest and with this wild bitter speech he flung away home again and left margaret weeping when a man misbehaves the effect is curious on a girl who loves him sincerely it makes her pity him this to some of us males seems anything but logical the fault is in our own eye the logic is too swift for us the girl argues thushow unhappy how vexed how poor he must be to misbehave poor thing margaret was full of this sweet womanly pity when to her great surprise scarce an hour and a half after he left her gerard came running back to her with the fragments of a picture in his hand and panting with anger and grief there margaret see see the wretches look at their spite they have cut your portrait to pieces margaret looked and sure enough some malicious hand had cut her portrait into five pieces she was a good girl but she was not ice she turned red to her very forehead who did it nay i know not i dared not ask for i should hate the hand that did it ay till my dying day my poor margaret the butchers the ruffians six months work cut out of my life and nothing to show for it now see they have hacked through your very face the sweet face that every one loves who knows it oh heartless merciless vipers never mind gerard said margaret panting since this is how they treat you for my sakeye rob him of my portrait do ye well then he shall have the face itself such as it is oh margaret yes gerard since they are so cruel i will be the kinder forgive me for refusing you i will be your wife tomorrow if it is your pleasure gerard kissed her hands with rapture and then her lips and in a tumult of joy ran for peter and martin they came and witnessed the betrothal a solemn ceremony in those days and indeed for more than a century later though now abolished chapter x the banns of marriage had to be read three times as in our days with this difference that they were commonly read on weekdays and the young couple easily persuaded the cure to do the three readings in twentyfour hours he was new to the place and their looks spoke volumes in their favour they were cried on monday at matins and at vespers and to their great delight nobody from tergou was in the church the next morning they were both there palpitating with anxiety when to their horror a stranger stood up and forbade the banns on the score that the parties were not of age and their parents not consenting outside the church door margaret and gerard held a trembling and almost despairing consultation but before they could settle anything the man who had done them so ill a turn approached and gave them to understand that he was very sorry to interfere that his inclination was to further the happiness of the young but that in point of fact his only means of getting a living was by forbidding banns what then the young people give me a crown and i undo my work handsomely tell the cure i was misinformed and all goes smoothly a crown i will give you a golden angel to do this said gerard eagerly the man consented as eagerly and went with gerard to the cure and told him he had made a ridiculous mistake which a sight of the parties had rectified on this the cure agreed to marry the young couple next day at ten and the professional obstructor of bliss went home with gerards angel like most of these very clever knaves he was a fool and proceeded to drink his angel at a certain hostelry in tergou where was a green devoted to archery and the common sports of the day there being drunk he bragged of his days exploit and who should be there imbibing every word but a great frequenter of the spot the neerdoweel sybrandt sybrandt ran home to tell his father his father was not at home he was gone to rotterdam to buy cloth of the merchants catching his elder brothers eye he made him a signal to come out and told him what he had heard there are black sheep in nearly every large family and these two were gerards black brothers idleness is vitiating waiting for the death of those we ought to love is vitiating and these two oneidead curs were ready to tear any one to death that should interfere with that miserable inheritance which was their thought by day and their dream by night their parents parsimony was a virtue it was accompanied by industry and its motive was love of their offspring but in these perverse and selfish hearts that homely virtue was perverted into avarice than which no more fruitful source of crimes is to be found in nature they put their heads together and agreed not to tell their mother whose sentiments were so uncertain but to go first to the burgomaster they were cunning enough to see that he was averse to the match though they could not divine why ghysbrecht van swieten saw through them at once but he took care not to let them see through him he heard their story and putting on magisterial dignity and coldness he said since the father of the family is not here his duty falleth on me who am the father of the town i know your fathers mind leave all to me and above all tell not a woman a word of this least of all the women that are in your own house for chattering tongues mar wisest counsels so he dismissed them a little superciliously he was ashamed of his confederates on their return home they found their brother gerard seated on a low stool at their mothers knee she was caressing his hair with her hand speaking very kindly to him and promising to take his part with his father and thwart his love no more the main cause of this change of mind was characteristic of the woman she it was who in a moment of female irritation had cut margarets picture to pieces she had watched the effect with some misgivings and had seen gerard turn pale as death and sit motionless like a bereaved creature with the pieces in his hands and his eyes fixed on them till tears came and blinded them then she was terrified at what she had done and next her heart smote her bitterly and she wept sore apart but being what she was dared not own it but said to herself ill not say a word but ill make it up to him and her bowels yearned over her son and her feeble violence died a natural death and she was transferring her fatal alliance to gerard when the two black sheep came in gerard knew nothing of the immediate cause on the contrary inexperienced as he was in the ins and outs of females her kindness made him ashamed of a suspicion he had entertained that she was the depredator and he kissed her again and again and went to bed happy as a prince to think his mother was his mother once more at the very crisis of his fate the next morning at ten oclock gerard and margaret were in the church at sevenbergen he radiant with joy she with blushes peter was also there and martin wittenhaagen but no other friend secrecy was everything margaret had declined italy she could not leave her father he was too learned and too helpless but it was settled they should retire into flanders for a few weeks until the storm should be blown over at tergou the cure did not keep them waiting long though it seemed an age presently he stood at the altar and called them to him they went hand in hand the happiest in holland the cure opened his book but ere he uttered a single word of the sacred rite a harsh voice cried forbear and the constables of tergou came up the aisle and seized gerard in the name of the law martins long knife flashed out directly forbear man cried the priest what draw your weapon in a church and ye who interrupt this holy sacrament what means this impiety there is no impiety father said the burgomasters servant respectfully this young man would marry against his fathers will and his father has prayed our burgomaster to deal with him according to the law let him deny it if he can is this so young man gerard hung his head we take him to rotterdam to abide the sentence of the duke at this margaret uttered a cry of despair and the young creatures who were so happy a moment ago fell to sobbing in one anothers arms so piteously that the instruments of oppression drew back a step and were ashamed but one of them that was goodnatured stepped up under pretence of separating them and whispered to margaret rotterdam it is a lie we but take him to our stadthouse they took him away on horseback on the road to rotterdam and after a dozen halts and by sly detours to tergou just outside the town they were met by a rude vehicle covered with canvas gerard was put into this and about five in the evening was secretly conveyed into the prison of the stadthouse he was taken up several flights of stairs and thrust into a small room lighted only by a narrow window with a vertical iron bar the whole furniture was a huge oak chest imprisonment in that age was one of the highroads to death it is horrible in its mildest form but in those days it implied cold unbroken solitude torture starvation and often poison gerard felt he was in the hands of an enemy oh the look that man gave me on the road to rotterdam there is more here than my fathers wrath i doubt i shall see no more the light of day and he kneeled down and commended his soul to god presently he rose and sprang at the iron bar of the window and clutched it this enabled him to look out by pressing his knees against the wall it was but for a minute but in that minute he saw a sight such as none but a captive can appreciate martin wittenhaagens back martin was sitting quietly fishing in the brook near the stadthouse gerard sprang again at the window and whistled martin instantly showed that he was watching much harder than fishing he turned hastily round and saw gerardmade him a signal and taking up his line and bow went quickly off gerard saw by this that his friends were not idle yet had rather martin had stayed the very sight of him was a comfort he held on looking at the soldiers retiring form as long as he could then falling back somewhat heavily wrenched the rusty iron bar held only by rusty nails away from the stonework just as ghysbrecht van swieten opened the door stealthily behind him the burgomasters eye fell instantly on the iron and then glanced at the window but he said nothing the window was a hundred feet from the ground and if gerard had a fancy for jumping out why should he balk it he brought a brown loaf and a pitcher of water and set them on the chest in solemn silence gerards first impulse was to brain him with the iron bar and fly down the stairs but the burgomaster seeing something wicked in his eye gave a little cough and three stout fellows armed showed themselves directly at the door my orders are to keep you thus until you shall bind yourself by an oath to leave margaret brandt and return to the church to which you have belonged from your cradle death sooner with all my heart and the burgomaster retired martin went with all speed to sevenbergen there he found margaret pale and agitated but full of resolution and energy she was just finishing a letter to the countess charolois appealing to her against the violence and treachery of ghysbrecht courage cried martin on entering i have found him he is in the haunted tower right at the top of it ay i know the place many a poor fellow has gone up there straight and come down feet foremost he then told them how he had looked up and seen gerards face at a window that was like a slit in the wall oh martin how did he look what mean you he looked like gerard eliassoen but was he pale a little looked he anxious looked he like one doomed nay nay as bright as a pewter pot you mock me stay then that must have been at sight of you he counts on us oh what shall we do martin good friend take this at once to rotterdam martin held out his hand for the letter peter had sat silent all this time but pondering and yet contrary to custom keenly attentive to what was going on around him put not your trust in princes said he alas what else have we to trust in knowledge welladay father your learning will not serve us here how know you that wit has been too strong for iron bars ere today ay father but nature is stronger than wit and she is against us think of the height no ladder in holland might reach him i need no ladder what i need is a gold crown nay i have money for that matter i have nine angels gerard gave them me to keep but what do they avail the burgomaster will not be bribed to let gerard free what do they avail give me but one crown and the young man shall sup with us this night peter spoke so eagerly and confidently that for a moment margaret felt hopeful but she caught martins eye dwelling upon him with an expression of benevolent contempt it passes the powers of mans invention said she with a deep sigh invention cried the old man a fig for invention what need we invention at this time of day everything has been said that is to be said and done that ever will be done i shall tell you how a florentine knight was shut up in a tower higher than gerards yet did his faithful squire stand at the tower foot and get him out with no other engine than that in your hand martin and certain kickshaws i shall buy for a crown martin looked at his bow and turned it round in his hand and seemed to interrogate it but the examination left him as incredulous as before then peter told them his story how the faithful squire got the knight out of a high tower at brescia the manoeuvre like most things that are really scientific was so simple that now their wonder was they had taken for impossible what was not even difficult the letter never went to rotterdam they trusted to peters learning and their own dexterity it was nine oclock on a clear moonlight night gerard senior was still away the rest of his little family had been some time abed a figure stood by the dwarfs bed it was white and the moonlight shone on it with an unearthly noise between a yell and a snarl the gymnast rolled off his bed and under it by a single unbroken movement a soft voice followed him in his retreat why giles are you afeard of me at this giless head peeped cautiously up and he saw it was only his sister kate she put her finger to her lips hush lest the wicked cornelis or the wicked sybrandt hear us giless claws seized the side of the bed and he returned to his place by one undivided gymnastic kate then revealed to giles that she had heard cornelis and sybrandt mention gerards name and being herself in great anxiety at his not coming home all day had listened at their door and had made a fearful discovery gerard was in prison in the haunted tower of the stadthouse he was there it seemed by their fathers authority but here must be some treachery for how could their father have ordered this cruel act he was at rotterdam she ended by entreating giles to bear her company to the foot of the haunted tower to say a word of comfort to poor gerard and let him know their father was absent and would be sure to release him on his return dear giles i would go alone but i am afeard of the spirits that men say do haunt the tower but with you i shall not be afeard nor i with you said giles i dont believe there are any spirits in tergou i never saw one this last was the likest one ever i saw and it was but you kate after all in less than half an hour giles and kate opened the housedoor cautiously and issued forth she made him carry a lantern though the night was bright the lantern gives me more courage against the evil spirits said she the first day of imprisonment is very trying especially if to the horror of captivity is added the horror of utter solitude i observe that in our own day a great many persons commit suicide during the first twentyfour hours of the solitary cell this is doubtless why our jairi abstain so carefully from the impertinence of watching their little experiment upon the human soul at that particular stage of it as the sun declined gerards heart too sank and sank with the waning light even the embers of hope went out he was faint too with hunger for he was afraid to eat the food ghysbrecht had brought him and hunger alone cows men he sat upon the chest his arms and his head drooping before him a picture of despondency suddenly something struck the wall beyond him very sharply and then rattled on the floor at his feet it was an arrow he saw the white feather a chill ran through himthey meant then to assassinate him from the outside he crouched no more missiles came he crawled on all fours and took up the arrow there was no head to it he uttered a cry of hope had a friendly hand shot it he took it up and felt it all over he found a soft substance attached to it then one of his eccentricities was of grand use to him his tinderbox enabled him to strike a light it showed him two things that made his heart bound with delight none the less thrilling for being somewhat vague attached to the arrow was a skein of silk and on the arrow itself were words written how his eyes devoured them his heart panting the while well beloved make fast the silk to thy knife and lower to us but hold thine end fast then count an hundred and draw up gerard seized the oak chest and with almost superhuman energy dragged it to the window a moment ago he could not have moved it standing on the chest and looking down he saw figures at the tower foot they were so indistinct they looked like one huge form he waved his bonnet to them with trembling hand then he undid the silk rapidly but carefully and made one end fast to his knife and lowered it till it ceased to draw then he counted a hundred then pulled the silk carefully up it came up a little heavier at last he came to a large knot and by that knot a stout whipcord was attached to the silk what could this mean while he was puzzling himself margarets voice came up to him low but clear draw up gerard till you see liberty at the word gerard drew the whipcord line up and drew and drew till he came to another knot and found a cord of some thickness take the place of the whipcord he had no sooner begun to draw this up than he found that he had now a heavy weight to deal with then the truth suddenly flashed on him and he went to work and pulled and pulled till the perspiration rolled down him the weight got heavier and heavier and at last he was wellnigh exhausted looking down he saw in the moonlight a sight that revived him it was as it were a great snake coming up to him out of the deep shadow cast by the tower he gave a shout of joy and a score more wild pulls and lo a stout new rope touched his hand he hauled and hauled and dragged the end into his prison and instantly passed it through both handles of the chest in succession and knotted it firmly then sat for a moment to recover his breath and collect his courage the first thing was to make sure that the chest was sound and capable of resisting his weight poised in midair he jumped with all his force upon it at the third jump the whole side burst open and out scuttled the contents a host of parchments after the first start and misgiving this gave him gerard comprehended that the chest had not burst but opened he had doubtless jumped upon some secret spring still it shook in some degree his confidence in the chests powers of resistance so he gave it an ally he took the iron bar and fastened it with the small rope across the large rope and across the window he now mounted the chest and from the chest put his foot through the window and sat half in and half out with one hand on that part of the rope which was inside in the silent night he heard his own heart beat the free air breathed on his face and gave him the courage to risk what we must all lose one dayfor liberty many dangers awaited him but the greatest was the first getting on to the rope outside gerard reflected finally he put himself in the attitude of a swimmer his body to the waist being in the prison his legs outside then holding the inside rope with both hands he felt anxiously with his feet for the outside rope and when he had got it he worked it in between the palms of his feet and kept it there tight then he uttered a short prayer and all the calmer for it put his left hand on the sill and gradually wriggled out then he seized the iron bar and for one fearful moment hung outside from it by his right hand while his left hand felt for the rope down at his knees it was too tight against the wall for his fingers to get round it higher up the moment he had fairly grasped it he left the bar and swiftly seized the rope with the right hand too but in this manoeuvre his body necessarily fell about a yard a stifled cry came up from below gerard hung in midair he clenched his teeth and nipped the rope tight with his feet and gripped it with his hands and went down slowly hand below hand he passed by one huge rough stone after another he saw there was green moss on one he looked up and he looked down the moon shone into his prison window it seemed very near the fluttering figures below seemed an awful distance it made him dizzy to look down so he fixed his eyes steadily on the wall close to him and went slowly down down down he passed a rusty slimy streak on the wall it was some ten feet long the rope made his hands very hot he stole another look up the prison window was a good way off now downdowndowndown the rope made his hands sore he looked up the window was so distant he ventured now to turn his eyes downward again and there not more than thirty feet below him were margaret and martin their faithful hands upstretched to catch him should he fall he could see their eyes and their teeth shine in the moonlight for their mouths were open and they were breathing hard take care gerard oh take care look not down fear me not cried gerard joyfully and eyed the wall but came down faster in another minute his feet were at their hands they seized him ere he touched the ground and all three clung together in one embrace hush away in silence dear one they stole along the shadow of the wall now ere they had gone many yards suddenly a stream of light shot from an angle of the building and lay across their path like a barrier of fire and they heard whispers and footsteps close at hand back hissed martin keep in the shade they hurried back passed the dangling rope and made for a little square projecting tower they had barely rounded it when the light shot trembling past them and flickered uncertainly into the distance a lantern groaned martin in a whisper they are after us give me my knife whispered gerard ill never be taken alive no no murmured margaret is there no way out where we are none none but i carry six lives at my shoulder and with the word martin strung his bow and fitted an arrow to the string in war never wait to be struck i will kill one or two ere they shall know where their death comes from then motioning his companions to be quiet he began to draw his bow and ere the arrow was quite drawn to the head he glided round the corner ready to loose the string the moment the enemy should offer a mark gerard and margaret held their breath in horrible expectation they had never seen a human being killed and now a wild hope but half repressed thrilled through gerard that this watchful enemy might be the burgomaster in person the soldier he knew would send an arrow through a burgher or burgomaster as he would through a boar in a wood but who may foretell the future however near the bow instead of remaining firm and loosing the deadly shaft was seen to waver first then shake violently and the stout soldier staggered back to them his knees knocking and his cheeks blanched with fear he let his arrow fall and clutched gerards shoulder let me feel flesh and blood he gasped the haunted tower the haunted tower his terror communicated itself to margaret and gerard they gasped rather than uttered an inquiry hush he cried it will hear you up the wall it is going up the wall its head is on fire up the wall as mortal creatures walk upon green sward if you know a prayer say it for hell is loose tonight i have power to exorcise spirits said gerard trembling i will venture forth go alone then said martin i have looked ont once and live chapter xi the strange glance of hatred the burgomaster had cast on gerard coupled with his imprisonment had filled the young man with a persuasion that ghysbrecht was his enemy to the death and he glided round the angle of the tower fully expecting to see no supernatural appearance but some cruel and treacherous contrivance of a bad man to do him a mischief in that prison his escape from which could hardly be known as he stole forth a soft but brave hand crept into his and margaret was by his side to share this new peril no sooner was the haunted tower visible than a sight struck their eyes that benumbed them as they stood more than halfway up the tower a creature with a fiery head like an enormous glowworm was steadily mounting the wall the body was dark but its outline visible through the glare from the head and the whole creature not much less than four feet long at the foot of the tower stood a thing in white that looked exactly like the figure of a female gerard and margaret palpitated with awe the rope the rope it is going up the rope gasped gerard as they gazed the glowworm disappeared in gerards late prison but its light illuminated the cell inside and reddened the window the white figure stood motionless below such as can retain their senses after the first prostrating effect of the supernatural are apt to experience terror in one of its strangest forms a wild desire to fling themselves upon the terrible object it fascinates them as the snake the bird the great tragedian macready used to render this finely in macbeth at banquos second appearance he flung himself with averted head at the horrible shadow this strange impulse now seized margaret she put down gerards hand quietly and stood bewildered then all in a moment with a wild cry darted towards the spectre gerard not aware of the natural impulse i have spoken of never doubted the evil one was drawing her to her perdition he fell on his knees exorcizo vos in nomine beatae mariae exorcizo vos while the exorcist was shrieking his incantations in extremity of terror to his infinite relief he heard the spectre utter a feeble cry of fear to find that hell had also its little weaknesses was encouraging he redoubled his exorcisms and presently he saw the ghastly shape kneeling at margarets knees and heard it praying piteously for mercy kate and giles soon reached the haunted tower judge their surprise when they found a new rope dangling from the prisoners window to the ground i see how it is said the inferior intelligence taking facts as they came our gerard has come down this rope he has got clear up i go and see no giles no said the superior intelligence blinded by prejudice see you not this is glamour this rope is a line the evil one casts out to wile thee to destruction he knows the weaknesses of all our hearts he has seen how fond you are of going up things where should our gerard procure a rope how fasten it in the sky like this it is not in nature holy saints protect us this night for hell is abroad stuff said the dwarf the way to hell is down and this rope leads up i never had the luck to go up such a long rope it may be years ere i fall in with such a long rope all ready for me as well be knocked on the head at once as never know happiness and he sprung on to the rope with a cry of delight as a cat jumps with a mew on to a table where fish is all the gymnast was on fire and the only concession kate could gain from him was permission to fasten the lantern on his neck first a light scares the ill spirits said she and so with his huge arms and his legs like feathers giles went up the rope faster than his brother came down it the light at the nape of his neck made a glowworm of him his sister watched his progress with trembling anxiety suddenly a female figure started out of the solid masonry and came flying at her with more than mortal velocity kate uttered a feeble cry it was all she could for her tongue clove to her palate with terror then she dropped her crutches and sank upon her knees hiding her face and moaning take my body but spare my soul margaret panting why it is a woman kate quivering why it is a woman margaret how you scared me kate i am scared enough myself oh oh oh this is strange but the fieryheaded thing yet it was with you and you are harmless but why are you here at this time of night nay why are you perhaps we are on the same errand ah you are his good sister kate and you are margaret brandt yes all the better you love him you are here then giles was right he has won free gerard came forward and put the question at rest but all further explanation was cut short by a horrible unearthly noise like a sepulchre ventriloquizing parchmentparchmentparchment at each repetition it rose in intensity they looked up and there was the dwarf with his hands full of parchments and his face lighted with fiendish joy and lurid with diabolical fire the light being at his neck a more infernal transparency never startled mortal eye with the word the awful imp hurled parchment at the astonished heads below down came records like wounded wildducks some collapsed others fluttering and others spread out and wheeling slowly down in airy circles they had hardly settled when again the sepulchral roar was heardparchmentparchment and down pattered and sailed another flock of documents another followed they whitened the grass finally the fireheaded imp with his light body and horny hands slid down the rope like a falling star and business before sentiment proposed to his rescued brother an immediate settlement for the merchandise he had just delivered hush said gerard you speak too loud gather them up and follow us to a safer place than this will you come home with me gerard said little kate i have no home you shall not say so who is more welcome than you will be after this cruel wrong to your fathers house father i have no father said gerard sternly he that was my father is turned my gaoler i have escaped from his hands i will never come within their reach again an enemy did this and not our father and she told him what she had overheard cornelis and sybrandt say but the injury was too recent to be soothed gerard showed a bitterness of indignation he had hitherto seemed incapable of cornelis and sybrandt are two ill curs that have shown me their teeth and their heart a long while but they could do no more my father it is that gave the burgomaster authority or he durst not have laid a finger on me that am a free burgher of this town so be it then i was his son i am his prisoner he has played his part i shall play mine farewell the burgh where i was born and lived honestly and was put in prison while there is another town left in creation ill never trouble you again tergou oh gerard gerard margaret whispered her do not gainsay him now give his choler time to cool kate turned quickly towards her let me look at your face the inspection was favourable it seemed for she whispered it is a comely face and no mischiefmakers fear me not said margaret in the same tone i could not be happy without your love as well as gerards these are comfortable words sobbed kate then looking up she said i little thought to like you so well my heart is willing but my infirmity will not let me embrace you at this hint margaret wound gently round gerards sister and kissed her lovingly often he has spoken of you to me kate and often i longed for this you too gerard said kate kiss me ere you go for my heart lies heavy at parting with you this night gerard kissed her and she went on her crutches home the last thing they heard of her was a little patient sigh then the tears came and stood thick in margarets eyes but gerard was a man and noticed not his sisters sigh as they turned to go to sevenbergen the dwarf nudged gerard with his bundle of parchments and held out a concave claw margaret dissuaded gerard why take what is not ours oh spoil an enemy how you can but may they not make this a handle for fresh violence how can they think you i shall stay in tergou after this the burgomaster robbed me of my liberty i doubt i should take his life for it if i could oh fie gerard what is life worth more than liberty well i cant take his life so i take the first thing that comes to hand he gave giles a few small coins with which the urchin was gladdened and shuffled after his sister margaret and gerard were speedily joined by martin and away to sevenbergen chapter xii ghysbrecht van swieten kept the key of gerards prison in his pouch he waited till ten of the clock ere he visited for he said to himself a little hunger sometimes does well it breaks em at ten he crept up the stairs with a loaf and pitcher followed by his trusty servant well armed ghysbrecht listened at the door there was no sound inside a grim smile stole over his features by this time he will be as downhearted as albert koestein was thought he he opened the door no gerard ghysbrecht stood stupefied although his face was not visible his body seemed to lose all motion in so peculiar a way and then after a little he fell trembling so that the servant behind him saw there was something amiss and crept close to him and peeped over his shoulder at sight of the empty cell and the rope and iron bar he uttered a loud exclamation of wonder but his surprise doubled when his master disregarding all else suddenly flung himself on his knees before the empty chest and felt wildly all over it with quivering hands as if unwilling to trust his eyes in a matter so important the servant gazed at him in utter bewilderment why master what is the matter ghysbrechts pale lips worked as if he was going to answer but they uttered no sound his hands fell by his side and he stared into the chest why master what avails glaring into that empty box the lad is not there see here note the cunning of the young rogue he hath taken out the bar and gone gone gone gone what is gone holy saints he is planetstruck stop thief shrieked ghysbrecht and suddenly turned on his servant and collared him and shook him with rage dye stand there knave and see your master robbed run fly a hundred crowns to him that finds it me again no no tis in vain oh fool fool to leave that in the same room with him but none ever found the secret spring before none ever would but he it was to be it is to be lost lost and his years and infirmity now gained the better of his shortlived frenzy and he sank on the chest muttering lost lost what is lost master asked the servant kindly house and lands and good name groaned ghysbrecht and wrung his hands feebly what cried the servant this emphatic word and the tone of eager curiosity struck on ghysbrechts ear and revived his natural cunning i have lost the town records stammered he and he looked askant at the man like a fox caught near a henroost oh is that all ist not enough what will the burghers say to me what will the burghs do then he suddenly burst out again a hundred crowns to him who shall recover them all mind all that were in this box if one be missing i give nothing tis a bargain master the hundred crowns are in my pouch see you not that where gerard eliassoen is there are the pieces of sheepskin you rate so high that is true that is true good dierich good faithful dierich all mind all that were in the chest master i will take the constables to gerards house and seize him for the theft the theft ay good very good it is theft i forgot that so as he is a thief now we will put him in the dungeons below where the toads are and the rats dierich that man must never see daylight again tis his own fault he must be prying quick quick ere he has time to talk you know time to talk in less than half an hour dierich brower and four constables entered the hosiers house and demanded young gerard of the panicstricken catherine alas what has he done now cried she that boy will break my heart nay dame but a trick of youth said dierich he hath but made off with certain skins of parchment in a frolic doubtless but the burgomaster is answerable to the burgh for their safe keeping so he is in care about them as for the youth he will doubtless be quit for a reprimand this smooth speech completely imposed on catherine but her daughter was more suspicious and that suspicion was strengthened by the disproportionate anger and disappointment dierich showed the moment he learned gerard was not at home had not been at home that night come away then said he roughly we are wasting time he added vehemently ill find him if he is above ground affection sharpens the wits and often it has made an innocent person more than a match for the wily as dierich was going out kate made him a signal she would speak with him privately he bade his men go on and waited outside the door she joined him hush said she my mother knows not gerard has left tergou how i saw him last night ay where cried dierich eagerly at the foot of the haunted tower how did he get the rope i know not but this i know my brother gerard bade me there farewell and he is many leagues from tergou ere this the town you know was always unworthy of him and when it imprisoned him he vowed never to set foot in it again let the burgomaster be content then he has imprisoned him and he has driven him from his birthplace and from his native land what need now to rob him and us of our good name this might at another moment have struck dierich as good sense but he was too mortified at this escape of gerard and the loss of a hundred crowns what need had he to steal retorted he bitterly gerard stole not the trash he but took it to spite the burgomaster who stole his liberty but he shall answer to the duke for it he shall as for these skins of parchment you keep such a coil about look in the nearest brook or stye and tis odds but you find them think ye so mistressthink ye so and dierichs eyes flashed mayhap you know tis so this i know that gerard is too good to steal and too wise to load himself with rubbish going a journey give you good day then said dierich sharply the sheepskin you scorn i value it more than the skin of any in tergou and he went off hastily on a false scent kate returned into the house and drew giles aside giles my heart misgives me breathe not to a soul what i say to you i have told dirk brower that gerard is out of holland but much i doubt he is not a league from tergou why where is he then where should he be but with her he loves but if so he must not loiter these be deep and dark and wicked men that seek him giles i see that in dirk browers eye makes me tremble oh why cannot i fly to sevenbergen and bid him away why am i not lusty and active like other girls god forgive me for fretting at his will but i never felt till now what it is to be lame and weak and useless but you are strong dear giles added she coaxingly you are very strong yes i am strong thundered perpusillus then catching sight of her meaning but i hate to go on foot he added sulkily alas alas who will help me if you will not dear giles do you not love gerard yes i like him best of the lot ill go to sevenbergen on peter buyskens his mule ask you him for he wont lend her me kate remonstrated the whole town would follow him it would be known whither he was gone and gerard be in worse danger than before giles parried this by promising to ride out of the town the opposite way and not turn the mules head towards sevenbergen till he had got rid of the curious kate then assented and borrowed the mule she charged giles with a short but meaning message and made him repeat it after her over and over till he could say it word for word giles started on the mule and little kate retired and did the last thing now in her power for her beloved brotherprayed on her knees long and earnestly for his safety chapter xiii gerard and margaret went gaily to sevenbergen in the first flush of recovered liberty and successful adventure but these soon yielded to sadder thoughts gerard was an escaped prisoner and liable to be retaken and perhaps punished and therefore he and margaret would have to part for a time moreover he had conceived a hatred to his native place margaret wished him to leave the country for a while but at the thought of his going to italy her heart fainted gerard on the contrary was reconciled to leaving margaret only by his desire to visit italy and his strong conviction that there he should earn money and reputation and remove every obstacle to their marriage he had already told her all that the demoiselle van eyck had said to him he repeated it and reminded margaret that the gold pieces were only given him to go to italy with the journey was clearly for gerards interest he was a craftsman and an artist lost in this boorish place in italy they would know how to value him on this ground above all the unselfish girl gave her consent but many tender tears came with it and at that gerard young and loving as herself cried bitterly with her and often they asked one another what they had done that so many different persons should be their enemies and combine as it seemed to part them they sat hand in hand till midnight now deploring their hard fate now drawing bright and hopeful pictures of the future in the midst of which margarets tears would suddenly flow and then poor gerards eloquence would die away in a sigh the morning found them resigned to part but neither had the courage to say when and much i doubt whether the hour of parting ever would have struck but about three in the afternoon giles who had made a circuit of many miles to avoid suspicion rode up to the door they both ran out to him eager with curiosity brother gerard cried he in his tremendous tones kate bids you run for your life they charge you with theft you have given them a handle think not to explain hope not for justice in tergou the parchments you took they are but a blind she hath seen your death in the mens eyes a price is on your head fly for margarets sake and all who love you loiter not life away but fly it was a thunderclap and left two white faces looking at one another and at the terrible messenger then giles who had hitherto but uttered by rote what catherine bade him put in a word of his own all the constables were at our house after you and so was dirk brower kate is wise gerard best give ear to her rede and fly oh yes gerard cried margaret wildly fly on the instant ah those parchments my mind misgave me why did i let you take them margaret they are but a blind giles says so no matter the old caitiff shall never see them again i will not go till i have hidden his treasure where he shall never find it gerard then after thanking giles warmly bade him farewell and told him to go back and tell kate he was gone for i shall be gone ere you reach home said he he then shouted for martin and told him what had happened and begged him to go a little way towards tergou and watch the road ay said martin and if i see dirk brower or any of his men i will shoot an arrow into the oaktree that is in our garden and on that you must run into the forest hard by and meet me at the weird hunters spring then i will guide you through the wood surprise thus provided against gerard breathed again he went with margaret and while she watched the oaktree tremblingly fearing every moment to see an arrow strike among the branches gerard dug a deep hole to bury the parchments in he threw them in one by one they were nearly all charters and records of the burgh but one appeared to be a private deed between floris brandt father of peter and ghysbrecht why this is as much yours as his said gerard i will read this oh not now gerard not now cried margaret every moment you lose fills me with fear and see large drops of rain are beginning to fall and the clouds lower gerard yielded to this remonstrance but he put the deed into his bosom and threw the earth in over the others and stamped it down while thus employed there came a flash of lightning followed by a peal of distant thunder and the rain came down heavily margaret and gerard ran into the house whither they were speedily followed by martin the road is clear said he and a heavy storm coming on his words proved true the thunder came nearer and nearer till it crashed overhead the flashes followed one another close like the strokes of a whip and the rain fell in torrents margaret hid her face not to see the lightning on this gerard put up the rough shutter and lighted a candle the lovers consulted together and gerard blessed the storm that gave him a few hours more with margaret the sun set unperceived and still the thunder pealed and the lightning flashed and the rain poured supper was set but gerard and margaret could not eat the thought that this was the last time they should sup together choked them the storm lulled a little peter retired to rest but gerard was to go at peep of day and neither he nor margaret could afford to lose an hour in sleep martin sat a while too for he was fitting a new string to his bow a matter in which he was very nice the lovers murmured their sorrows and their love beside him suddenly the old man held up his hand to them to be silent they were quiet and listened and heard nothing but the next moment a footstep crackled faintly upon the autumn leaves that lay strewn in the garden at the back door of the house to those who had nothing to fear such a step would have said nothing but to those who had enemies it was terrible for it was a foot trying to be noiseless martin fitted an arrow to his string and hastily blew out the candle at this moment to their horror they heard more than one footstep approach the other door of the cottage not quite so noiselessly as the other but very stealthilyand then a dead pause their blood froze in their veins oh kate oh kate you said fly on the instant and margaret moaned and wrung her hands in anguish and terror and wild remorse for having kept gerard hush girl said martin in a stern whisper a heavy knock fell on the door and on the hearts within chapter xiv as if this had been a concerted signal the back door was struck as rudely the next instant they were hemmed in but at these alarming sounds margaret seemed to recover some share of selfpossession she whispered say he was here but is gone and with this she seized gerard and almost dragged him up the rude steps that led to her fathers sleepingroom her own lay next beyond it the blows on the door were repeated who knocks at this hour open and you will see i open not to thieveshonest men are all abed now open to the law martin wittenhaagen or you shall rue it why that is dirk browers voice i trow what make you so far from tergou open and you will know martin drew the bolt very slowly and in rushed dierich and four more they let in their companion who was at the back door now martin where is gerard eliassoen gerard eliassoen why he was here but now was here dierichs countenance fell and where is he now they say he has gone to italy why what is to do no matter when did he go tell me not that he went in such a storm as this here is a coil about gerard eliassoen said martin contemptuously then he lighted the candle and seating himself coolly by the fire proceeded to whip some fine silk round his bowstring at the place where the nick of the arrow frets it ill tell you said he carelessly know you his brother gilesa little misbegotten imp all head and arms well he came tearing over here on a mule and bawled out something i was too far off to hear the creatures words but only its noise any way he started gerard for as soon as he was gone there was such crying and kissing and then gerard went away they do tell me he has gone to italymayhap you know where that is for i dont dierichs countenance fell lower and lower at this account there was no flaw in it a cunninger man than martin would perhaps have told a lie too many and raised suspicion but martin did his task well he only told the one falsehood he was bade to tell and of his own head invented nothing mates said dierich i doubt he speaks sooth i told the burgomaster how twould be he met the dwarf galloping peter buyskenss mule from sevenbergen they have sent that imp to gerard says he so then gerard is at sevenbergen ah master says i tis too late now we should have thought of sevenbergen before instead of wasting our time hunting all the odd corners of tergou for those cursed parchments that we shall never find till we find the man that took em if he was at sevenbergen quoth i and they sent the dwarf to him it must have been to warn him we are after him he is leagues away by now quoth i confound that chalkfaced girl she has outwitted us bearded men and so i told the burgomaster but he would not hear reason a wet jerkin apiece that is all we shall get mates by this job martin grinned coolly in dierichs face however added the latter to content the burgomaster we will search the house martin turned grave directly this change of countenance did not escape dierich he reflected a moment watch outside two of you one on each side of the house that no one jump from the upper windows the rest come with me and he took the candle and mounted the stairs followed by three of his comrades martin was left alone the stout soldier hung his head all had gone so well at first and now this fatal turn suddenly it occurred to him that all was not yet lost gerard must be either in peters room or margarets they were not so very high from the ground gerard would leap out dierich had left a man below but what then for half a minute gerard and he would be two to one and in that brief space what might not be done martin then held the back door ajar and watched the light shone in peters room curse the fool said he is he going to let them take him like a girl the light now passed into margarets bedroom still no window was opened had gerard intended to escape that way he would not have waited till the men were in the room martin saw that at once and left the door and came to the footstair and listened he began to think gerard must have escaped by the window while all the men were in the house the longer the silence continued the stronger grew this conviction but it was suddenly and rudely dissipated faint cries issued from the inner bedroommargarets they have taken him groaned martin they have got him it now flashed across martins mind that if they took gerard away his life was not worth a button and that if evil befell him margarets heart would break he cast his eyes wildly round like some savage beast seeking an escape and in a twinkling formed a resolution terribly characteristic of those iron times and of a soldier driven to bay he stepped to each door in turn and imitating dierich browers voice said sharply watch the window he then quietly closed and bolted both doors he then took up his bow and six arrows one he fitted to his string the others he put into his quiver his knife he placed upon a chair behind him the hilt towards him and there he waited at the foot of the stair with the calm determination to slay those four men or be slain by them two he knew he could dispose of by his arrows ere they could get near him and gerard and he must take their chance handtohand with the remaining pair besides he had seen men panicstricken by a sudden attack of this sort should brower and his men hesitate but an instant before closing with him he should shoot three instead of two and then the odds would be on the right side he had not long to wait the heavy steps sounded in margarets room and came nearer and nearer the light also approached and voices martins heart stout as it was beat hard to hear men coming thus to their death and perhaps to his more likely so than not for four is long odds in a battlefield of ten feet square and gerard might be bound perhaps and powerless to help but this man whom we have seen shake in his shoes at a gilesolanthorn never wavered in this awful moment of real danger but stood there his body all braced for combat and his eye glowing equally ready to take life and lose it desperate game to win which was exile instant and for life and to lose it was to die that moment upon that floor he stood on dierich brower and his men found peter in his first sleep they opened his cupboards they ran their knives into an alligator he had nailed to his wall they looked under his bed it was a large room and apparently full of hidingplaces but they found no gerard then they went on to margarets room and the very sight of it was discouragingit was small and bare and not a cupboard in it there was however a large fireplace and chimney dierichs eye fell on these directly here they found the beauty of sevenbergen sleeping on an old chest not a foot high and no attempt made to cover it but the sheets were snowy white and so was margarets own linen and there she lay looking like a lily fallen into a rut presently she awoke and sat up in the bed like one amazed then seeing the men began to scream faintly and pray for mercy she made dierich brower ashamed of his errand here is a todo said he a little confused we are not going to hurt you my pretty maid lie you still and shut your eyes and think of your weddingnight while i look up this chimney to see if master gerard is there gerard in my room why not they say that you and he cruel you know they have driven him away from medriven him from his native place this is a blind you are thieves you are wicked men you are not men of sevenbergen or you would know margaret brandt better than to look for her lover in this room of all others in the world oh brave four great hulking men to come armed to the teeth to insult one poor honest girl the women that live in your own houses must be naught or you would respect them too much to insult a girl of good character there come away before we hear worse said dierich hastily he is not in the chimney plaster will mend what a cudgel breaks but a womans tongue is a doubleedged dagger and a girl is a woman with her mothers milk still in her and he beat a hasty retreat i told the burgomaster how twould be chapter xv where is the woman that cannot act a part where is she who will not do it and do it well to save the man she loves nature on these great occasions comes to the aid of the simplest of the sex and teaches her to throw dust in solomons eyes the men had no sooner retired than margaret stepped out of bed and opened the long chest on which she had been lying down in her skirt and petticoat and stockings and nightdress over all and put the lid bedclothes and all against the wall then glided to the door and listened the footsteps died away through her fathers room and down the stairs now in that chest there was a peculiarity that it was almost impossible for a stranger to detect a part of the boarding of the room had been broken and gerard being applied to to make it look neater and being short of materials had ingeniously sawed away a space sufficient just to admit margarets soidisant bed and with the materials thus acquired he had repaired the whole room as for the bed or chest it really rested on the rafters a foot below the boards consequently it was full two feet deep though it looked scarce one all was quiet margaret kneeled and gave thanks to heaven then she glided from the door and leaned over the chest and whispered tenderly gerard gerard did not reply she then whispered a little louder gerard all is safe thank heaven you may rise but oh be cautious gerard made no reply she laid her hand upon his shouldergerard no reply oh what is this she cried and her hands ran wildly over his face and his bosom she took him by the shoulders she shook him she lifted him but he escaped from her trembling hands and fell back not like a man but like a body a great dread fell on her the lid had been down she had lain upon it the men had been some time in the room with all the strength of frenzy she tore him out of the chest she bore him in her arms to the window she dashed the window open the sweet air came in she laid him in it and in the moonlight his face was the colour of ashes his body was all limp and motionless she felt his heart horror it was as still as the rest horror of horrors she had stifled him with her own body the mind cannot all at once believe so great and sudden and strange a calamity gerard who had got alive into that chest scarce five minutes ago how could he be dead she called him by all the endearing names that heart could think or tongue could frame she kissed him and fondled him and coaxed him and implored him to speak to her no answer to words of love such as she had never uttered to him before nor thought she could utter then the poor creature trembling all over began to say over that ashy face little foolish things that were at once terrible and pitiable oh gerard i am very sorry you are dead i am very sorry i have killed you forgive me for not letting the men take you it would have been better than this oh gerard i am very very sorry for what i have done then she began suddenly to rave no no such things cant be or there is no god it is monstrous how can my gerard be dead how can i have killed my gerard i love him oh god you know how i love him he does not i never told him if he knew my heart he would speak to me he would not be so deaf to his poor margaret it is all a trick to make me cry out and betray him but no i love him too well for that ill choke first and she seized her own throat to check her wild desire to scream in her terror and anguish if he would but say one word oh gerard dont die without a word have mercy on me and scold me but speak to me if you are angry with me scold me curse me i deserve it the idiot that killed the man she loved better than herself ah i am a murderess the worst in all the world help help i have murdered him ah ah ah ah ah she tore her hair and uttered shriek after shriek so wild so piercing they fell like a knell upon the ears of dierich brower and his men all started to their feet and looked at one another chapter xvi martin wittenhaagen standing at the foot of the stairs with his arrow drawn nearly to the head and his knife behind him was struck with amazement to see the men come back without gerard he lowered his bow and looked openmouthed at them they for their part were equally puzzled at the attitude they had caught him in why mates was the old fellow making ready to shoot at us stuff said martin recovering his stolid composure i was but trying my new string there ill unstring my bow if you think that humph said dierich suspiciously there is something more in you than i understand put a log on and let us dry our hides a bit ere we go a blazing fire was soon made and the men gathered round it and their clothes and long hair were soon smoking from the cheerful blaze then it was that the shrieks were heard in margarets room they all started up and one of them seized the candle and ran up the steps that led to the bedrooms martin rose hastily too and being confused by these sudden screams and apprehending danger from the mans curiosity tried to prevent him from going there at this dierich threw his arms round him from behind and called on the others to keep him the man that had the candle got clear away and all the rest fell upon martin and after a long and fierce struggle in the course of which they were more than once all rolling on the floor with martin in the middle they succeeded in mastering the old samson and binding him hand and foot with a rope they had brought for gerard martin groaned aloud he saw the man had made his way to margarets room during the struggle and here was he powerless ay grind your teeth you old rogue said dierich panting with the struggle you shant use them it is my belief mates that our lives were scarce safe while this old fellows bones were free he makes me think this gerard is not far off put in another no such luck replied dierich hallo mates jorian ketel is a long time in that girls bedroom best go and see after him some of us the rude laugh caused by this remark had hardly subsided when hasty footsteps were heard running along over head oh here he comes at last well jorian what is to do now up there chapter xvii jorian ketel went straight to margarets room and there to his infinite surprise he found the man he had been in search of pale and motionless his head in margarets lap and she kneeling over him mute now and stricken to stone her eyes were dilated yet glazed and she neither saw the light nor heard the man nor cared for anything on earth but the white face in her lap jorian stood awestruck the candle shaking in his hand why where was he then all the time margaret heeded him not jorian went to the empty chest and inspected it he began to comprehend the girls dumb and frozen despair moved him this is a sorry sight said he it is a black nights work all for a few skins better have gone with us than so she is past answering me poor wench stop let us try whether he took down a little round mirror no bigger than his hand and put it to gerards mouth and nostrils and held it there when he withdrew it it was dull there is life in him said jorian ketel to himself margaret caught the words instantly though only muttered and it was if a statue should start into life and passion she rose and flung her arms round jorians neck oh bless the tongue that tells me so and she clasped the great rough fellow again and again eagerly almost fiercely there there let us lay him warm said jorian and in a moment he raised gerard and laid him on the bedclothes then he took out a flask he carried and filled his hand twice with schiedamze and flung it sharply each time in gerards face the pungent liquor cooperated with his recoveryhe gave a faint sigh oh never was sound so joyful to human ear she flew towards him but then stopped quivering for fear she should hurt him she had lost all confidence in herself that is rightlet him alone said jorian dont go cuddling him as you did me or youll drive his breath back again let him alone he is sure to come to tisnt like as if he was an old man gerard sighed deeply and a faint streak of colour stole to his lips jorian made for the door he had hardly reached it when he found his legs seized from behind it was margaret she curled round his knees like a serpent and kissed his hand and fawned on him you wont tell you have saved his life you have not the heart to thrust him back into his grave to undo your own good work no no it is not the first time i have done you two a good turn twas i told you in the church whither we had to take him besides what is dierich brower to me ill see him hanged ere ill tell him but i wish youd tell me where the parchments are there are a hundred crowns offered for them that would be a good windfall for my joan and the children you know ah they shall have those hundred crowns what are the things in the house asked jorian eagerly no but i know where they are and by god and st bavon i swear you shall have them tomorrow come to me for them when you will but come alone i were made else what share the hundred crowns with dirk brower and now may my bones rot in my skin if i let a soul know the poor boy is here he then ran off lest by staying longer he should excite suspicion and have them all after him and margaret knelt quivering from head to foot and prayed beside gerard and for gerard what is to do replied jorian to dierich browers query why we have scared the girl out of her wits she was in a kind of fit we had better all go and doctor her then oh yes and frighten her into the churchyard her father is a doctor and i have roused him and set him to bring her round let us see the fire will ye his offhand way disarmed all suspicion and soon after the party agreed that the kitchen of the three kings was much warmer than peters house and they departed having first untied martin take note mate that i was right and the burgomaster wrong said dierich brower at the door i said we should be too late to catch him and we were too late thus gerard in one terrible night grazed the prison and the grave and how did he get clear at last not by his cunningly contrived hidingplace nor by margarets ready wit but by a good impulse in one of his captors by the bit of humanity left in a somewhat reckless fellows heart aided by his desire of gain so mixed and seemingly incongruous are human motives so shortsighted our shrewdest counsels they whose moderate natures or gentle fates keep them in lifes passage from the fierce extremes of joy and anguish our nature is capable of are perhaps the best and certainly the happiest of mankind but to such readers i should try in vain to convey what bliss unspeakable settled now upon these persecuted lovers even to those who have joyed greatly and greatly suffered my feeble art can present but a pale reflection of margarets and gerards ecstasy to sit and see a beloved face come back from the grave to the world to health and beauty by swift gradations to see the roses return to the loved cheek loves glance to the loved eye and his words to the loved mouththis was margaretsa joy to balance years of sorrow it was gerards to awake from a trance and find his head pillowed on margarets arm to hear the woman he adored murmur new words of eloquent love and shower tears and tender kisses and caresses on him he never knew till this sweet moment how ardently how tenderly she loved him he thanked his enemies they wreathed their arms sweetly round each other and trouble and danger seemed a world an age behind them they called each other husband and wife were they not solemnly betrothed and had they not stood before the altar together was not the blessing of holy church upon their unionher curse on all who would part them but as no womans nerves can bear with impunity so terrible a strain presently margaret turned faint and sank on gerards shoulder smiling feebly but quite quite unstrung then gerard was anxious and would seek assistance but she held him with a gentle grasp and implored him not to leave her for a moment while i can lay my hand on you i feel you are safe not else foolish gerard nothing ails me i am weak dearest but happy oh so happy then it was gerards turn to support that dear head with its great waves of hair flowing loose over him and nurse her and soothe her quivering on his bosom with soft encouraging words and murmurs of love and gentle caresses sweetest of all her charms is a womans weakness to a manly heart poor things they were happy tomorrow they must part but that was nothing to them now they had seen death and all other troubles seemed light as air while there is life there is hope while there is hope there is joy separation for a year or two what was it to them who were so young and had caught a glimpse of the grave the future was bright the present was heaven so passed the blissful hours alas their innocence ran other risks besides the prison and the grave they were in most danger from their own hearts and their inexperience now that visible danger there was none chapter xviii ghysbrecht van swieten could not sleep all night for anxiety he was afraid of thunder and lightning or he would have made one of the party that searched peters house as soon as the storm ceased altogether he crept downstairs saddled his mule and rode to the three kings at sevenbergen there he found his men sleeping some on the chairs some on the tables some on the floor he roused them furiously and heard the story of their unsuccessful search interlarded with praises of their zeal fool to let you go without me cried the burgomaster my life ont he was there all the time looked ye under the girls bed no there was no room for a man there how know ye that if ye looked not snarled ghysbrecht ye should have looked under her bed and in it too and sounded all the panels with your knives come now get up and i shall show ye how to search dierich brower got up and shook himself if you find him call me a horse and no man in a few minutes peters house was again surrounded the fiery old man left his mule in the hands of jorian ketel and with dierich brower and the others entered the house the house was empty not a creature to be seen not even peter they went upstairs and then suddenly one of the men gave a shout and pointed through peters window which was open the others looked and there at some little distance walking quietly across the fields with margaret and martin was the man they sought ghysbrecht with an exulting yell descended the stairs and flung himself on his mule and he and his men set off in hot pursuit chapter xix gerard warned by recent peril rose before daybreak and waked martin the old soldier was astonished he thought gerard had escaped by the window last night being consulted as to the best way for him to leave the country and elude pursuit he said there was but one road safe i must guide you through the great forest to a bridleroad i know of this will take you speedily to a hostelry where they will lend you a swift horse and then a days gallop will take you out of holland but let us start ere the folk here quit their beds peters house was but a furlong and a half from the forest they started martin with his bow and three arrows for it was thursday gerard with nothing but a stout oak staff peter gave him for the journey margaret pinned up her kirtle and farthingale for the road was wet peter went as far as his garden hedge with them and then with more emotion than he often bestowed on passing events gave the young man his blessing the sun was peeping above the horizon as they crossed the stony field and made for the wood they had crossed about half when margaret who kept nervously looking back every now and then uttered a cry and following her instinct began to run towards the wood screaming with terror all the way ghysbrecht and his men were in hot pursuit resistance would have been madness martin and gerard followed margarets example the pursuers gained slightly on them but martin kept shouting only win the wood only win the wood they had too good a start for the men on foot and their hearts bounded with hope at martins words for the great trees seemed now to stretch their branches like friendly arms towards them and their leaves like a screen but an unforeseen danger attacked them the fiery old burgomaster flung himself on his mule and spurring him to a gallop he headed not his own men only but the fugitives his object was to cut them off the old man came galloping in a semicircle and got on the edge of the wood right in front of gerard the others might escape for aught he cared margaret shrieked and tried to protect gerard by clasping him but he shook her off without ceremony ghysbrecht in his ardour forgot that hunted animals turn on the hunter and that two men can hate and two can long to kill the thing they hate instead of attempting to dodge him as the burgomaster made sure he would gerard flew right at him with a savage exulting cry and struck at him with all his heart and soul and strength the oak staff came down on ghysbrechts face with a frightful crash and laid him under his mules tail beating the devils tattoo with his heels his face streaming and his collar spattered with blood the next moment the three were in the wood the yell of dismay and vengeance that burst from ghysbrechts men at that terrible blow which felled their leader told the fugitives that it was now a race for life or death why run cried gerard panting you have your bow and i have this and he shook his bloody staff boy roared martin the gallows follow me and he fled into the wood soon they heard a cry like a pack of hounds opening on sight of the game the men were in the wood and saw them flitting amongst the trees margaret moaned and panted as she ran and gerard clenched his teeth and grasped his staff the next minute they came to a stiff hazel coppice martin dashed into it and shouldered the young wood aside as if it were standing corn ere they had gone fifty yards in it they came to four blind paths martin took one bend low said he and half creeping they glided along presently their path was again intersected with other little tortuous paths they took one of them it seemed to lead back but it soon took a turn and after a while brought them to a thick pine grove where the walking was good and hard there were no paths here and the young firtrees were so thick you could not see three yards before your nose when they had gone some way in this martin sat down and having learned in war to lose all impression of danger with the danger itself took a piece of bread and a slice of ham out of his wallet and began quietly to eat his breakfast the young ones looked at him with dismay he replied to their looks all sevenbergen could not find you now you will lose your purse gerard long before you get to italy is that the way to carry a purse gerard looked and there was a large triangular purse entangled by its chains to the buckle and strap of his wallet this is none of mine said he what is in it i wonder and he tried to detach it but in passing through the coppice it had become inextricably entangled in his strap and buckle it seems loath to leave me said gerard and he had to cut it loose with his knife the purse on examination proved to be well provided with silver coins of all sizes but its bloated appearance was greatly owing to a number of pieces of brown paper folded and doubled a light burst on gerard why it must be that old thiefs and see stuffed with paper to deceive the world the wonder was how the burgomasters purse came on gerard they hit at last upon the right solution the purse must have been at ghysbrechts saddlebow and gerard rushing at his enemy had unconsciously torn it away thus felling his enemy and robbing him with a single gesture gerard was delighted at this feat but margaret was uneasy throw it away gerard or let martin take it back already they call you a thief i cannot bear it throw it away give it him back not a stiver this is spoil lawfully won in battle from an enemy is it not martin why of course send him back the brown paper and you will but the purse or the cointhat were a sin oh gerard said margaret you are going to a distant land we need the goodwill of heaven how can we hope for that if we take what is not ours but gerard saw it in a different light it is heaven that gives it me by a miracle and i shall cherish it accordingly said this pious youth thus the favoured people spoiled the egyptians and were blessed take your own way said margaret humbly you are wiser than i am you are my husband added she in a low murmuring voice is it for me to gainsay you these humble words from margaret who till that day had held the whiphand rather surprised martin for the moment they recurred to him some time afterwards and then they surprised him less gerard kissed her tenderly in return for her wifelike docility and they pursued their journey hand in hand martin leading the way into the depths of the huge forest the farther they went the more absolutely secure from pursuit they felt indeed the townspeople never ventured so far as this into the trackless part of the forest impetuous natures repent quickly gerard was no sooner out of all danger than his conscience began to prick him martin would i had not struck quite so hard whom oh let that pass he is cheap served martin i saw his grey hairs as my stick fell on him i doubt they will not from my sight this while martin grunted with contempt who spares a badger for his grey hairs the greyer your enemy is the older and the older the craftier and the craftier the better for a little killing killing killing martin speak not of killing and gerard shook all over i am much mistook if you have not said martin cheerfully now heaven forbid the old vagabonds skull cracked like a walnut aha heaven and the saints forbid it he rolled off his mule like a stone shot out of a cart said i to myself there is one wiped out and the iron old soldier grinned ruthlessly gerard fell on his knees and began to pray for his enemys life at this martin lost his patience heres mummery what you that set up for learning know you not that a wise man never strikes his enemy but to kill him and what is all this coil about killing of old men if it had been a young one now with the joys of life waiting for him wine women and pillage but an old fellow at the edge of the grave why not shove him in go he must today or tomorrow and what better place for greybeards now if ever i should be so mischancy as to last so long as ghysbrecht did and have to go on a mules legs instead of martin wittenhaagens and a back like this striking the wood of his bow instead of this striking the string ill thank and bless any young fellow who will knock me on the head as you have done that old shopkeeper malison on his memory oh culpa mea culpa mea cried gerard and smote upon his breast look there cried martin to margaret scornfully he is a priest at heart stilland when he is not in ire st paul what a milksop tush martin cried margaret reproachfully then she wreathed her arms round gerard and comforted him with the double magic of a womans sense and a womans voice sweetheart murmured she you forget you went not a step out of the way to harm him who hunted you to your death you fled from him he it was who spurred on you then did you strike but in selfdefence and a single blow and with that which was in your hand malice had drawn knife or struck again and again how often have men been smitten with staves not one but many blows yet no lives lost if then your enemy has fallen it is through his own malice not yours and by the will of god bless you margaret bless you for thinking so yes but beloved one if you have had the misfortune to kill that wicked man the more need is there that you fly with haste from holland oh let us on nay margaret said gerard i fear not mans vengeance thanks to martin here and this thick wood only him i fear whose eye pierces the forest and reads the heart of man if i but struck in selfdefence tis well but if in hate he may bid the avenger of blood follow me to italyto italy ay to earths remotest bounds hush said martin peevishly i cant hear for your chat what is it do you hear nothing margaret my ears are getting old margaret listened and presently she heard a tuneful sound like a single stroke upon a deep ringing bell she described it so to martin nay i heard it said he and so did i said gerard it was beautiful ah there it is again how sweetly it blends with the air it is a long way off it is before us is it not no no the echoes of this wood confound the ear of a stranger it comes from the pine grove what the one we passed why martin is this anything you look pale wonderful said martin with a sickly sneer he asks me is it anything come on on at any rate let us reach a better place than this a better placefor what to stand at bay gerard said martin gravely and die like soldiers killing three for one whats that sound it is the avenger of blood oh martin save him oh heaven be merciful what new mysterious peril is this girl its a bloodhound chapter xx the courage like the talent of common men runs in a narrow groove take them but an inch out of that and they are done martins courage was perfect as far as it went he had met and baffled many dangers in the course of his rude life and these familiar dangers he could face with spartan fortitude almost with indifference but he had never been hunted by a bloodhound nor had he ever seen that brutes unerring instinct baffled by human cunning here then a sense of the supernatural combined with novelty to ungenteel his heart after going a few steps he leaned on his bow and energy and hope oozed out of him gerard to whom the danger appeared slight in proportion as it was distant urged him to flight what avails it said martin sadly if we get clear of the wood we shall die cheap here hard by i know a place where we may die dear alas good martin cried gerard despair not so quickly there must be some way to escape oh martin cried margaret what if we were to part company gerards life alone is forfeit is there no way to draw the pursuit on us twain and let him go safe girl you know not the bloodhounds nature he is not on this mans track or that he is on the track of blood my life ont they have taken him to where ghysbrecht fell and from the dead mans blood to the man that shed it that cursed hound will lead them though gerard should run through an army or swim the meuse and again he leaned upon his bow and his head sank the hounds mellow voice rang through the wood a cry more tunable was never halloed to nor cheered with horn in crete in sparta or in thessaly strange that things beautiful should be terrible and deadly the eye of the boaconstrictor while fascinating its prey is lovely no royal crown holds such a jewel it is a ruby with the emeralds green light playing ever upon it yet the deer that sees it loses all power of motion and trembles and awaits his death and even so to compare hearing with sight this sweet and mellow sound seemed to fascinate martin wittenhaagen he stood uncertain bewildered and unnerved gerard was little better now martins last words had daunted him he had struck an old man and shed his blood and by means of that very blood bloods fourfooted avenger was on his track was not the finger of heaven in this whilst the men were thus benumbed the womans brain was all activity the man she loved was in danger lend me your knife said she to martin he gave it her but twill be little use in your hands said he then margaret did a sly thing she stepped behind gerard and furtively drew the knife across her arm and made it bleed freely then stooping smeared her hose and shoes and still as the blood trickled she smeared them but so adroitly that neither gerard nor martin saw then she seized the soldiers arm come be a man she said and let this end take us to some thick place where numbers will not avail our foes i am going said martin sulkily hurry avails not we cannot shun the hound and the place is hard by then turning to the left he led the way as men go to execution he soon brought them to a thick hazel coppice like the one that had favoured their escape in the morning there said he this is but a furlong broad but it will serve our turn what are we to do get through this and wait on the other side then as they come straggling through shoot three knock two on the head and the rest will kill us is that all you can think of said gerard that is all then martin wittenhaagen i take the lead for you have lost your head come can you obey so young a man as i am oh yes martin cried margaret do not gainsay gerard he is wiser than his years martin yielded a sullen assent do then as you see me do said gerard and drawing his huge knife he cut at every step a hazel shoot or two close by the ground and turning round twisted them breasthigh behind him among the standing shoots martin did the same but with a dogged hopeless air when they had thus painfully travelled through the greater part of the coppice the bloodhounds deep bay came nearer and nearer less and less musical louder and sterner margaret trembled martin went down on his stomach and listened i hear a horses feet no said gerard i doubt it is a mules that cursed ghysbrecht is still alive none other would follow me up so bitterly never strike your enemy but to slay him said martin gloomily ill hit harder this time if heaven gives me the chance said gerard at last they worked through the coppice and there was an open wood the trees were large but far apart and no escape possible that way and now with the hounds bay mingled a score of voices hooping and hallooing the whole village is out after us said martin i care not said gerard listen martin i have made the track smooth to the dog but rough to the men that we may deal with them apart thus the hound will gain on the men and as soon as he comes out of the coppice we must kill him the hound there are more than one i hear but one ay but one speaks the others run mute but let the leading hound lose the scent then another shall give tongue there will be two dogs at least or devils in dogs hides then we must kill two instead of one the moment they are dead into the coppice again and go right back that is a good thought gerard said martin plucking up heart hush the men are in the wood gerard now gave his orders in a whisper stand you with your bow by the side of the coppicethere in the ditch i will go but a few yards to yon oaktree and hide behind it the dogs will follow me and as they come out shoot as many as you can the rest will i brain as they come round the tree martins eye flashed they took up their places the hooping and hallooing came closer and closer and soon even the rustling of the young wood was heard and every now and then the unerring bloodhound gave a single bay it was terrible the branches rustling nearer and nearer and the inevitable struggle for life and death coming on minute by minute and that deathknell leading it a trembling hand was laid on gerards shoulder it made him start violently strung up as he was martin says if we are forced to part company make for that high ashtree we came in by yes yes yes but go back for heavens sake dont come here all out in the open she ran back towards martin but ere she could get to him suddenly a huge dog burst out of the coppice and stood erect a moment margaret cowered with fear but he never noticed her scent was to him what sight is to us he lowered his nose an instant and the next moment with an awful yell sprang straight at gerards tree and rolled headoverheels dead as a stone literally spitted with an arrow from the bow that twanged beside the coppice in martins hand that same moment out came another hound and smelt his dead comrade gerald rushed out at him but ere he could use his cudgel a streak of white lightning seemed to strike the hound and he grovelled in the dust wounded desperately but not killed and howling piteously gerard had not time to despatch him the coppice rustled too near it seemed alive pointing wildly to martin to go back gerard ran a few yards to the right then crept cautiously into the thick coppice just as three men burst out these had headed their comrades considerably the rest were following at various distances gerard crawled back almost on allfours instinct taught martin and margaret to do the same upon their line of retreat thus within the distance of a few yards the pursuers and pursued were passing one another upon opposite tracks a loud cry announced the discovery of the dead and the wounded hound then followed a babble of voices still swelling as fresh pursuers reached the spot the hunters as usual on a surprise were wasting time and the hunted ones were making the most of it i hear no more hounds whispered martin to margaret and he was himself again it was margarets turn to tremble and despair oh why did we part with gerard they will kill my gerard and i not near him nay nay the head to catch him is not on their shoulders you bade him meet us at the ashtree and so i did bless you martin for thinking of that to the ashtree ay but with less noise they were now nearly at the edge of the coppice when suddenly they heard hooping and hallooing behind them the men had satisfied themselves the fugitives were in the coppice and were beating back no matter whispered martin to his trembling companion we shall have time to win clear and slip back out of sight by hard running ah he stooped suddenly for just as he was going to burst out of the brushwood his eye caught a figure keeping sentinel it was ghysbrecht van swieten seated on his mule a bloody bandage was across his nose the bridge of which was broken but over this his eyes peered keenly and it was plain by their expression he had heard the fugitives rustle and was looking out for them martin muttered a terrible oath and cautiously strung his bow then with equal caution fitted his last arrow to the string margaret put her hands to her face but said nothing she saw this man must die or gerard after the first impulse she peered through her fingers her heart panting to her throat the bow was raised and the deadly arrow steadily drawn to its head when at that moment an active figure leaped on ghysbrecht from behind so swiftly it was like a hawk swooping on a pigeon a kerchief went over the burgomaster in a turn of the hand his head was muffled in it and he was whirled from his seat and fell heavily upon the ground where he lay groaning with terror and gerard jumped down after him hist martin martin martin and margaret came out the former openmouthed crying now fly fly while they are all in the thicket we are saved at this crisis when safety seemed at hand as fate would have it margaret who had borne up so bravely till now began to succumb partly from loss of blood oh my beloved fly she gasped leave me for i am faint no no cried gerard death together or safety ah the mule mount her you and ill run by your side in a moment martin was on ghysbrechts mule and gerard raised the fainting girl in his arms and placed her on the saddle and relieved martin of his bow help treason murder murder shrieked ghysbrecht suddenly rising on his hams silence cur roared gerard and trode him down again by the throat as men crush an adder now have you got her firm then fly for our lives for our lives but even as the mule urged suddenly by martins heel scattered the flints with his hind hoofs ere he got into a canter and even as gerard withdrew his foot from ghysbrechts throat to run dierich brower and his five men who had come back for orders and heard the burgomasters cries burst roaring out of the coppice on them chapter xxi speech is the familiar vent of human thoughts but there are emotions so simple and overpowering that they rush out not in words but eloquent sounds at such moments man seems to lose his characteristics and to be merely one of the higher animals for these when greatly agitated ejaculate though they cannot speak there was something terrible and truly animal both in the roar of triumph with which the pursuers burst out of the thicket on our fugitives and the sharp cry of terror with which these latter darted away the pursuers hands clutched the empty air scarce two feet behind them as they fled for life confused for a moment like lions that miss their spring dierich and his men let gerard and the mule put ten yards between them then they flew after with uplifted weapons they were sure of catching them for this was not the first time the parties had measured speed in the open ground they had gained visibly on the three this morning and now at last it was a fair race again to be settled by speed alone a hundred yards were covered in no time yet still there remained these ten yards between the pursuers and the pursued this increase of speed since the morning puzzled dierich brower the reason was this when three run in company the pace is that of the slowest of the three from peters house to the edge of the forest gerard ran margarets pace but now he ran his own for the mule was fleet and could have left them all far behind moreover youth and chaste living began to tell daylight grew imperceptibly between the hunted ones and the hunters then dierich made a desperate effort and gained two yards but in a few seconds gerard had stolen them quietly back the pursuers began to curse martin heard and his face lighted up courage gerard courage brave lad they are straggling it was so dierich was now headed by one of his men and another dropped into the rear altogether they came to a rising ground not sharp but long and here youth and grit and sober living told more than ever ere he reached the top dierichs forty years weighed him down like forty bullets our cake is dough he gasped take him dead if you cant alive and he left running and followed at a foots pace jorian ketel tailed off next and then another and so one by one gerard ran them all to a standstill except one who kept on stanch as a bloodhound though losing ground every minute his name if i am not mistaken was eric wouverman followed by him they came to a rise in the wood shorter but much steeper than the last hand on mane cried martin gerard obeyed and the mule helped him up the hill faster even than he was running before at the sight of this manoeuvre dierichs man lost heart and being now full eighty yards behind gerard and rather more than that in advance of his nearest comrade he pulled up short and in obedience to dierichs order took down his crossbow levelled it deliberately and just as the trio were sinking out of sight over the crest of the hill sent the bolt whizzing among them there was a cry of dismay and next moment as if a thunderbolt had fallen on them they were all lying on the ground mule and all chapter xxii the effect was so sudden and magical that the shooter himself was stupefied for an instant then he hailed his companions to join him in effecting the capture and himself set off up the hill but ere he had got half way up rose the figure of martin wittenhaagen with a bent bow in his hand eric wouverman no sooner saw him in this attitude than he darted behind a tree and made himself as small as possible martins skill with that weapon was well known and the slain dog was a keen reminder of it wouverman peered round the bark cautiously there was the arrows point still aimed at him he saw it shine he dared not move from his shelter when he had been at peepho some minutes his companions came up in great force then with a scornful laugh martin vanished and presently was heard to ride off on the mule all the men ran up together the high ground commanded a view of a narrow but almost interminable glade they saw gerard and margaret running along at a prodigious distance they looked like gnats and martin galloping after them ventre a terre the hunters were outwitted as well as outrun a few words will explain martins conduct we arrive at causes by noting coincidences yet now and then coincidences are deceitful as we have all seen a hare tumble over a briar just as the gun went off and so raise expectations then dash them to earth by scudding away untouched so the burgomasters mule put her foot in a rabbithole at or about the time the crossbow bolt whizzed innocuous over her head she fell and threw both her riders gerard caught margaret but was carried down by her weight and impetus and behold the soil was strewed with dramatis personae the docile mule was up again directly and stood trembling martin was next and looking round saw there was but one in pursuit on this he made the young lovers fly on foot while he checked the enemy as i have recorded he now galloped after his companions and when after a long race he caught them he instantly put gerard and margaret on the mule and ran by their side till his breath failed then took his turn to ride and so in rotation thus the runner was always fresh and long ere they relaxed their speed all sound and trace of them was hopelessly lost to dierich and his men these latter went crestfallen back to look after their chief and their winged bloodhound chapter xxiii life and liberty while safe are little thought of for why they are matters of course endangered they are rated at their real value in this too they are like sunshine whose beauty men notice not at noon when it is greatest but towards evening when it lies in flakes of topaz under shady elms yet it is feebler then but gloom lies beside it and contrast reveals its fire thus gerard and margaret though they started at every leaf that rustled louder than its fellows glowed all over with joy and thankfulness as they glided among the friendly trees in safety and deep tranquil silence baying dogs and brutal voices yet ringing in their minds ears but presently gerard found stains of blood on margarets ankles martin martin help they have wounded her the crossbow no no said margaret smiling to reassure him i am not wounded nor hurt at all but what is it then in heavens name cried gerard in great agitation scold me not then and margaret blushed did i ever scold you no dear gerard well then martin said it was blood those cruel dogs followed so i thought if i could but have a little blood on my shoon the dogs would follow me instead and let my gerard wend free so i scratched my arm with martins knifeforgive me whose else could i take yours gerard ah no you forgive me said she beseechingly and lovingly and fawningly all in one let me see this scratch first said gerard choking with emotion there i thought so a scratch i call it a cuta deep terrible cruel cut gerard shuddered at sight of it she might have done it with her bodkin said the soldier milksop that sickens at sight of a scratch and a little blood no no i could look on a sea of blood but not on hers oh margaret how could you be so cruel margaret smiled with love ineffable foolish gerard murmured she to make so much of nothing and she flung the guilty arm round his neck as if i would not give all the blood in my heart for you let alone a few drops from my arm and with this under the sense of his recent danger she wept on his neck for pity and love and he wept with her and i must part from her he sobbed we two that love so dearone must be in holland one in italy ah me ah me ah me at this margaret wept afresh but patiently and silently instinct is never off its guard and with her unselfishness was an instinct to utter her present thoughts would be to add to gerards misery at parting so she wept in silence suddenly they emerged upon a beaten path and martin stopped this is the bridleroad i spoke of said he hanging his head and there away lies the hostelry margaret and gerard cast a scared look at one another come a step with me martin whispered gerard when he had drawn him aside he said to him in a broken voice good martin watch over her for me she is my wife yet i leave her see martin here is goldit was for my journey it is no use my asking her to take itshe would not but you will for her will you not oh heaven and is this all i can do for her money but poverty is a curse you will not let her want for anything dear martin the burgomasters silver is enough for me thou art a good lad gerard neither want nor harm shall come to her i care more for her little finger than for all the world and were she nought to me even for thy sake would i be a father to her go with a stout heart and god be with thee going and coming and the rough soldier wrung gerards hand and turned his head away with unwonted feeling after a moments silence he was for going back to margaret but gerard stopped him no good martin prithee stay here behind this thicket and turn your head away from us while ioh martin martin by this means gerard escaped a witness of his anguish at leaving her he loved and martin escaped a piteous sight he did not see the poor young things kneel and renew before heaven those holy vows cruel men had interrupted he did not see them cling together like one and then try to part and fail and return to one another and cling again like drowning despairing creatures but he heard gerard sob and sob and margaret moan at last there was a hoarse cry and feet pattered on the hard road he started up and there was gerard running wildly with both hands clasped above his head in prayer and margaret tottering back towards him with palms extended piteously as if for help and ashy cheek and eyes fixed on vacancy he caught her in his arms and spoke words of comfort to her but her mind could not take them in only at the sound of his voice she moaned and held him tight and trembled violently he got her on the mule and put his arm around her and so supporting her frame which from being strong like a boy had now turned all relaxed and powerless he took her slowly and sadly home she did not shed one tear nor speak one word at the edge of the wood he took her off the mule and bade her go across to her fathers house she did as she was bid martin to rotterdam sevenbergen was too hot for him gerard severed from her he loved went like one in a dream he hired a horse and a guide at the little hostelry and rode swiftly towards the german frontier but all was mechanical his senses felt blunted trees and houses and men moved by him like objects seen through a veil his companions spoke to him twice but he did not answer only once he cried out savagely shall we never be out of this hateful country after many hours riding they came to the brow of a steep hill a small brook ran at the bottom halt cried the guide and pointed across the valley here is germany where on tother side of the bourn no need to ride down the hill i trow gerard dismounted without a word and took the burgomasters purse from his girdle while he opened it you will soon be out of this hateful country said his guide half sulkily mayhap the one you are going to will like you no better any way though it be a church you have robbed they cannot take you once across that bourn these words at another time would have earned the speaker an admonition or a cuff they fell on gerard now like idle air he paid the lad in silence and descended the hill alone the brook was silvery it ran murmuring over little pebbles that glittered varnished by the clear water he sat down and looked stupidly at them then he drank of the brook then he laved his hot feet and hands in it it was very cold it waked him he rose and taking a run leaped across it into germany even as he touched the strange land he turned suddenly and looked back farewell ungrateful country he cried but for her it would cost me nought to leave you for ever and all my kith and kin andthe mother that bore me andmy playmates and my little native town farewell fatherlandwelcome the wide world omne solum forti p patra and with these brave words in his mouth he drooped suddenly with arms and legs all weak and sat down and sobbed bitterly upon the foreign soil when the young exile had sat a while bowed down he rose and dashed the tears from his eyes like a man and not casting a single glance more behind him to weaken his heart stepped out into the wide world his love and heavy sorrow left no room in him for vulgar misgivings compared with rending himself from margaret it seemed a small thing to go on foot to italy in that rude age all nations meet in a convent so thanks to his good friends the monks and his own thirst of knowledge he could speak most of the languages needed on that long road he said to himself i will soon be at rome the sooner the better now after walking a good league he came to a place where four ways met being country roads and serpentine they had puzzled many an inexperienced neighbour passing from village to village gerard took out a little dial peter had given him and set it in the autumn sun and by this compass steered unhesitatingly for rome inexperienced as a young swallow flying south but unlike the swallow wandering south alone chapter xxiv not far on this road he came upon a little group two men in sober suits stood leaning lazily on each side of a horse talking to one another the rider in a silk doublet and bright green jerkin and hose both of english cloth glossy as a mole lay flat on his stomach in the afternoon sun and looked an enormous lizard his velvet cloak flaming yellow was carefully spread over the horses loins is aught amiss inquired gerard not that i wot of replied one of the servants but your master he lies like a corpse are ye not ashamed to let him grovel on the ground go to the bare ground is the best cure for his disorder if you get sober in bed it gives you a headache but you leap up from the hard ground like a lark in spring eh ulric he speaks sooth young man said ulric warmly what is the gentleman drunk the servants burst into a hoarse laugh at the simplicity of gerards question but suddenly ulric stopped and eyeing him all over said very gravely who are you and where born that know not the count is ever drunk at this hour and gerard found himself a suspected character i am a stranger said he but a true man and one that loves knowledge therefore ask i questions and not for love of prying if you be a true man said ulric shrewdly then give us trinkgeld for the knowledge we have given you gerard looked blank but putting a good face on it said trinkgeld you shall have such as my lean purse can spare an if you will tell me why ye have taen his cloak from the man and laid it on the beast under the inspiring influence of coming trinkgeld two solutions were instantly offered gerard at once the one was that should the count come to himself which being a seasoned toper he was apt to do all in a minute and find his horse standing sweating in the cold while a cloak lay idle at hand he would fall to cursing and peradventure to laying on the other more pretentious was that a horse is a poor milksop which drinking nothing but water has to be cockered up and warmed outside but a master being a creature ever filled with good beer has a store of inward heat that warms him to the skin and renders a cloak a mere shred of idle vanity each of the speakers fell in love with his theory and to tell the truth both had taken a hair or two of the dog that had bitten their master to the brain so their voices presently rose so high that the green sot began to growl instead of snoring in their heat they did not notice this ere long the argument took a turn that sooner or later was pretty sure to enliven a discussion in that age hans holding the bridle with his right hand gave ulric a sound cuff with his left ulric returned it with interest his right hand being free and at it they went ding dong over the horses mane pommelling one another and jagging the poor beast till he ran backward and trode with iron heel upon a promontory of the green lord he like the toad stung by ithuriels spear started up howling with one hand clapped to the smart and the other tugging at his hilt the servants amazed with terror let the horse go he galloped off whinnying the men in pursuit of him crying out with fear and the green noble after them volleying curses his naked sword in his hand and his body rebounding from hedge to hedge in his headlong but zigzag career down the narrow lane in which hurtling gerard turned his back on them all and went calmly south glad to have saved the four tin farthings he had got ready for trinkgeld but far too heavy hearted even to smile at their drunken extravagance the sun was nearly setting and gerard who had now for some time been hoping in vain to find an inn by the way was very ill at ease to make matters worse black clouds gathered over the sky gerard quickened his pace almost to a run it was in vain down came the rain in torrents drenched the bewildered traveller and seemed to extinguish the very sunfor his rays already fading could not cope with this new assailant gerard trudged on dark and wet and in an unknown region fool to leave margaret said he presently the darkness thickened he was entering a great wood huge branches shot across the narrow road and the benighted stranger groped his way in what seemed an interminable and inky cave with a rugged floor on which he stumbled and stumbled as he went on and on and on with shivering limbs and empty stomach and fainting heart till the wolves rose from their lairs and bayed all round the wood his hair bristled but he grasped his cudgel and prepared to sell his life dear there was no wind and his excited ear heard light feet patter at times over the newly fallen leaves and low branches rustle with creatures gliding swiftly past them presently in the sea of ink there was a great fiery star close to the ground he hailed it as he would his patron saint candle a candle he shouted and tried to run but the dark and rugged way soon stopped that the light was more distant than he had thought but at last in the very heart of the forest he found a house with lighted candles and loud voices inside it he looked up to see if there was a signboard there was none not an inn after all said he sadly no matter what christian would turn a dog out into this wood tonight and with this he made for the door that led to the voices he opened it slowly and put his head in timidly he drew it out abruptly as if slapped in the face and recoiled into the rain and darkness he had peeped into a large but low room the middle of which was filled by a huge round stove or clay oven that reached to the ceiling round this wet clothes were dryingsome on lines and some more compendiously on rustics these latter habiliments impregnated with the wet of the day but the dirt of a life and lined with what another foot traveller in these parts call rammish clowns evolved rank vapours and compound odours inexpressible in steaming clouds in one corner was a travelling family a large one thence flowed into the common stock the peculiar sickly smell of neglected brats garlic filled up the interstices of the air and all this with closed window and intense heat of the central furnace and the breath of at least forty persons they had just supped now gerard like most artists had sensitive organs and the potent effluvia struck dismay into him but the rain lashed him outside and the light and the fire tempted him in he could not force his way all at once through the palpable perfumes but he returned to the light again and again like the singed moth at last he discovered that the various smells did not entirely mix no fiend being there to stir them round odour of family predominated in two corners stewed rustic reigned supreme in the centre and garlic in the noisy group by the window he found too by hasty analysis that of these the garlic described the smallest aerial orbit and the scent of reeking rustic darted farthesta flavour as if ancient goats or the fathers of all foxes had been drawn through a river and were here dried by nebuchadnezzar so gerard crept into a corner close to the door but though the solidity of the main fetors isolated them somewhat the heat and reeking vapours circulated and made the walls drip and the homenurtured novice found something like a cold snake wind about his legs and his head turn to a great lump of lead and next he felt like choking sweetly slumbering and dying all in one he was within an ace of swooning but recovered to a deep sense of disgust and discouragement and settled to go back to holland at peep of day this resolution formed he plucked up a little heart and being faint with hunger asked one of the men of garlic whether this was not an inn after all whence come you who know not the star of the forest was the reply i am a stranger and in my country inns have aye a sign droll country yours what need of a sign to a publichousea place that every soul knows gerard was too tired and faint for the labour of argument so he turned the conversation and asked where he could find the landlord at this fresh display of ignorance the natives contempt rose too high for words he pointed to a middleaged woman seated on the other side of the oven and turning to his mates let them know what an outlandish animal was in the room thereat the loud voices stopped one by one as the information penetrated the mass and each eye turned as on a pivot following gerard and his every movement silently and zoologically the landlady sat on a chair an inch or two higher than the rest between two bundles from the first a huge heap of feathers and wings she was taking the downy plumes and pulling the others from the quills and so filling bundle two littering the floor ankledeep and contributing to the general stock a stuffy little malaria which might have played a distinguished part in a sweet room but went for nothing here gerard asked her if he could have something to eat she opened her eyes with astonishment supper is over this hour and more but i had none of it good dame is that my fault you were welcome to your share for me but i was benighted and a stranger and belated sore against my will what have i to do with that all the world knows the star of the forest sups from six till eight come before six ye sup well come before eight ye sup as pleases heaven come after eight ye get a clean bed and a stirrup cup or a horn of kines milk at the dawning gerard looked blank may i go to bed then dame said he sulkily for it is ill sitting up wet and fasting and the byword saith he sups who sleeps the beds are not come yet replied the landlady you will sleep when the rest do inns are not built for one it was gerards turn to be astonished the beds were not come what in heavens name did she mean but he was afraid to ask for every word he had spoken hitherto had amazed the assembly and zoological eyes were upon himhe felt them he leaned against the wall and sighed audibly at this fresh zoological trait a titter went round the watchful company so this is germany thought gerard and germany is a great country by holland small nations for me he consoled himself by reflecting it was to be his last as well as his first night in the land his reverie was interrupted by an elbow driven into his ribs he turned sharp on his assailant who pointed across the room gerard looked and a woman in the corner was beckoning him he went towards her gingerly being surprised and irresolute so that to a spectator her beckoning finger seemed to be pulling him across the floor with a gutline when he had got up to her hold the child said she in a fine hearty voice and in a moment she plumped the bairn into gerards arms he stood transfixed jelly of lead in his hands and sudden horror in his elongated countenance at this ruefully expressive face the lynxeyed conclave laughed loud and long never heed them said the woman cheerfully they know no better how should they bred an born in a wood she was rummaging among her clothes with the two penetrating hands one of which gerard had set free presently she fished out a small tin plate and a dried pudding and resuming her child with one arm held them forth to gerard with the other keeping a thumb on the pudding to prevent it from slipping off put it in the stove said she you are too young to lie down fasting gerard thanked her warmly but on his way to the stove his eye fell on the landlady may i dame said he beseechingly why not said she the question was evidently another surprise though less startling than its predecessors coming to the stove gerard found the oven door obstructed by the rammish clowns they did not budge he hesitated a moment the landlady saw calmly put down her work and coming up pulled a hircine man or two hither and pushed a hircine man or two thither with the impassive countenance of a housewife moving her furniture turn about is fair play she said ye have been dry this ten minutes and better her experienced eye was not deceived gorgonii had done stewing and begun baking debarred the stove they trundled home all but one who stood like a table where the landlady had moved him to like a table and gerard baked his pudding and getting to the stove burst into steam the door opened and in flew a bundle of straw it was hurled by a hind with a pitchfork another and another came flying after it till the room was like a clean farmyard these were then dispersed round the stove in layers like the seats in an arena and in a moment the company was all on its back the beds had come gerard took out his pudding and found it delicious while he was relishing it the woman who had given it him and who was now abed beckoned him again he went to her bundle side she is waiting for you whispered the woman gerard returned to the stove and gobbled the rest of his sausage casting uneasy glances at the landlady seated silent as fate amid the prostrate multitude the food bolted he went to her and said thank you kindly dame for waiting for me you are welcome said she calmly making neither much nor little of the favour and with that began to gather up the feathers but gerard stopped her nay that is my task and he went down on his knees and collected them with ardour she watched him demurely i wot not whence ye come said she with a relic of distrust adding more cordially but ye have been well brought upy have had a good mother ill go bail at the door she committed the whole company to heaven in a formula and disappeared gerard to his straw in the very cornerfor the guests lay round the sacred stove by seniority ie priority of arrival this punishment was a boon to gerard for thus he lay on the shore of odour and stifling heat instead of in midocean he was just dropping off when he was awaked by a noise and lo there was the hind remorselessly shaking and waking guest after guest to ask him whether it was he who had picked up the mistresss feathers it was i cried gerard oh it was you was it said the other and came striding rapidly over the intermediate sleepers she bade me say one good turn deserves another and so heres your nightcap and he thrust a great oaken mug under gerards nose i thank her and bless her here goesugh and his gratitude ended in a wry face for the beer was muddy and had a strange medicinal twang new to the hollander trinke aus shouted the hind reproachfully enow is as good as a feast said the youth jesuitically the hind cast a look of pity on this stranger who left liquor in his mug ich brings euch said he and drained it to the bottom and now gerard turned his face to the wall and pulled up two handfuls of the nice clean straw and bored in them with his finger and so made a scabbard and sheathed his nose in it and soon they were all asleep men maids wives and children all lying higgledypiggledy and snoring in a dozen keys like an orchestra slowly tuning and gerards body lay on straw in germany and his spirit was away to sevenbergen when he woke in the morning he found nearly all his fellowpassengers gone one or two were waiting for dinner nine oclock it was now six he paid the landlady her demand two pfenning or about an english halfpenny and he of the pitchfork demanded trinkgeld and getting a trifle more than usual and seeing gerard eye a foaming milkpail he had just brought from the cow hoisted it up bodily to his lips drink your fill man said he and on gerard offering to pay for the delicious draught told him in broad patois that a man might swallow a skinful of milk or a breakfast of air without putting hand to pouch at the door gerard found his benefactress of last night and a hugechested artisan her husband gerard thanked her and in the spirit of the age offered her a creutzer for her pudding but she repulsed his hand quietly for what do you take me said she colouring faintly we are travellers and strangers the same as you and bound to feel for those in like plight then gerard blushed in his turn and stammered excuses the hulking husband grinned superior to them both give the vixen a kiss for her pudding and cry quits said he with an air impartial judgelike and jovelike gerard obeyed the lofty behest and kissed the wifes cheek a blessing go with you both good people said he and god speed you young man replied the honest couple and with that they parted and never met again in this world the sun had just risen the raindrops on the leaves glittered like diamonds the air was fresh and bracing and gerard steered south and did not even remember his resolve of overnight eight leagues he walked that day and in the afternoon came upon a huge building with an enormous arched gateway and a postern by its side a monastery cried he joyfully i go no further lest i fare worse he applied at the postern and on stating whence he came and whither bound was instantly admitted and directed to the guestchamber a large and lofty room where travellers were fed and lodged gratis by the charity of the monastic orders soon the bell tinkled for vespers and gerard entered the church of the convent and from his place heard a service sung so exquisitely it seemed the choir of heaven but one thing was wanting margaret was not there to hear it with him and this made him sigh bitterly in mid rapture at supper plain but wholesome and abundant food and good beer brewed in the convent were set before him and his fellows and at an early hour they were ushered into a large dormitory and the number being moderate had each a truckle bed and for covering sheepskins dressed with the fleece on but previously to this a monk struck by his youth and beauty questioned him and soon drew out his projects and his heart when he was found to be convent bred and going alone to rome he became a personage and in the morning they showed him over the convent and made him stay and dine in the refectory they also pricked him a route on a slip of parchment and the prior gave him a silver guilden to help him on the road and advised him to join the first honest company he should fall in with and not face alone the manifold perils of the way perils said gerard to himself that evening he came to a small straggling town where was one inn it had no sign but being now better versed in the customs of the country he detected it at once by the coats of arms on its walls these belonged to the distinguished visitors who had slept in it at different epochs since its foundation and left these customary tokens of their patronage at present it looked more like a mausoleum than a hotel nothing moved nor sounded either in it or about it gerard hammered on the great oak door no answer he hallooed no reply after a while he hallooed louder and at last a little round window or rather hole in the wall opened a mans head protruded cautiously like a tortoises from its shell and eyed gerard stolidly but never uttered a syllable is this an inn asked gerard with a covert sneer the head seemed to fall into a brown study eventually it nodded but lazily can i have entertainment here again the head pondered and ended by nodding but sullenly and seemed a skull overburdened with catchpenny interrogatories how am i to get within ant please you at this the head popped in as if the last question had shot it and a hand popped out pointed round the corner of the building and slammed the window gerard followed the indication and after some research discovered that the fortification had one vulnerable part a small low door on its flank as for the main entrance that was used to keep out thieves and customers except once or twice in a year when they entered together ie when some duke or count arrived in pomp with his train of gaudy ruffians gerard having penetrated the outer fort soon found his way to the stove as the public room was called from the principal article in it and sat down near the oven in which were only a few live embers that diffused a mild and grateful heat after waiting patiently a long time he asked a grim old fellow with a long white beard who stalked solemnly in and turned the hourglass and then was stalking out when supper would be the grisly ganymede counted the guests on his fingerswhen i see thrice as many here as now gerard groaned the grisly tyrant resented the rebellious sound inns are not built for one said he if you cant wait for the rest look out for another lodging gerard sighed at this the greybeard frowned after a while company trickled steadily in till full eighty persons of various conditions were congregated and to our novice the place became a chamber of horrors for here the mothers got together and compared ringworms and the men scraped the mud off their shoes with their knives and left it on the floor and combed their long hair out inmates included and made their toilet consisting generally of a dry rub water however was brought in ewers gerard pounced on one of these but at sight of the liquid contents lost his temper and said to the waiter wash you first your water and then a man may wash his hands withal an it likes you not seek another inn gerard said nothing but went quietly and courteously besought an old traveller to tell him how far it was to the next inn about four leagues then gerard appreciated the grim pleasantry of the unbending sire that worthy now returned with an armful of wood and counting the travellers put on a log for every six by which act of raw justice the hotter the room the more heat he added poor gerard noticed this little flaw in the ancient mans logic but carefully suppressed every symptom of intelligence lest his feet should have to carry his brains four leagues farther that night when perspiration and suffocation were far advanced they brought in the tablecloths but oh so brown so dirty and so coarse they seemed like sacks that had been worn out in agriculture and come down to this or like shreads from the mainsail of some wornout ship the hollander who had never seen such linen even in nightmare uttered a faint cry what is to do inquired a traveller gerard pointed ruefully to the dirty sackcloth the other looked at it with lack lustre eye and comprehended nought a burgundian soldier with his arbalest at his back came peeping over gerards shoulder and seeing what was amiss laughed so loud that the room rang again then slapped him on the back and cried courage le diable est mort gerard stared he doubted alike the good tidings and their relevancy but the tones were so hearty and the arbalestriers face notwithstanding a formidable beard was so gay and genial that he smiled and after a pause said drily il a bien faite avec leau et linge du pays on allait le noircir a ne se reconnaitre plus tiens tiens cried the soldier vla qui parle le francais peu sen faut and he seated himself by gerard and in a moment was talking volubly of war women and pillage interlarding his discourse with curious oaths at which gerard drew away from him more or less presently in came the grisly servant and counted them all on his fingers superciliously like abraham telling sheep then went out again and returned with a deal trencher and deal spoon to each then there was an interval then he brought them a long mug apiece made of glass and frowned byandby he stalked gloomily in with a hunch of bread apiece and exit with an injured air expectation thus raised the guests sat for nearly an hour balancing the wooden spoons and with their own knives whittling the bread eventually when hope was extinct patience worn out and hunger exhausted a huge vessel was brought in with pomp the lid was removed a cloud of steam rolled forth and behold some thin broth with square pieces of bread floating this though not agreeable to the mind served to distend the body slices of strasbourg ham followed and pieces of salt fish both so highly salted that gerard could hardly swallow a mouthful then came a kind of gruel and when the repast had lasted an hour and more some hashed meat highly peppered and the french and dutch being now full to the brim with the above dainties and the draughts of beer the salt and spiced meats had provoked in came roasted kids most excellent and carp and trout fresh from the stream gerard made an effort and looked angrily at them but could no more as the poets say the burgundian swore by the liver and pikestaff of the good centurion the natives had outwitted him then turning to gerard he said courage lami le diable est mort as loudly as before but not with the same tone of conviction the canny natives had kept an internal corner for contingencies and polished the kids very bones the feast ended with a dish of raw animalcula in a wicker cage a cheese had been surrounded with little twigs and strings then a hole made in it and a little sour wine poured in this speedily bred a small but numerous vermin when the cheese was so rotten with them that only the twigs and string kept it from tumbling to pieces and walking off quadrivious it came to table by a malicious caprice of fate cage and menagerie were put down right under the dutchmans organ of selftorture he recoiled with a loud ejaculation and hung to the bench by the calves of his legs what is the matter said a traveller disdainfully does the good cheese scare ye then put it hither in the name of all the saints cheese cried gerard i see none these nauseous reptiles have made away with every bit of it well replied another it is not gone far by eating of the mites we eat the cheese to boot nay not so said gerard these reptiles are made like us and digest their food and turn it to foul flesh even as we do ours to sweet as well might you think to chew grass by eating of grassfed beeves as to eat cheese by swallowing these uncleanly insects gerard raised his voice in uttering this and the company received the paradox in dead silence and with a distrustful air like any other stranger during which the burgundian who understood german but imperfectly made gerard gallicize the discussion he patted his interpreter on the back cest bien mon gars plus fin que toi nest pas bete and administered his formula of encouragement and gerard edged away from him for next to ugly sights and ill odours the poor wretch disliked profaneness meantime though shaken in argument the raw reptiles were duly eaten and relished by the company and served to provoke thirst a principal aim of all the solids in that part of germany so now the company drank garausses all round and their tongues were unloosed and oh the babel but above the fierce clamour rose at intervals like some heros warcry in battle the trumpetlike voice of the burgundian soldier shouting lustily courage camarades le diable est mort entered grisly ganymede holding in his hand a wooden dish with circles and semicircles marked on it in chalk he put it down on the table and stood silent sad and sombre as charon by styx waiting for his boatload of souls then pouches and purses were rummaged and each threw a coin into the dish gerard timidly observed that he had drunk next to no beer and inquired how much less he was to pay than the others what mean you said ganymede roughly whose fault is it you have not drunken are all to suffer because one chooses to be a milksop you will pay no more than the rest and no less gerard was abashed courage petit le diable est mort hiccoughed the soldier and flung ganymede a coin you are bad as he is said the old man peevishly you are paying too much and the tyrannical old aristides returned him some coin out of the trencher with a most reproachful countenance and now the man whom gerard had confuted an hour and a half ago awoke from a brown study in which he had been ever since and came to him and said yes but the honey is none the worse for passing through the bees bellies gerard stared the answer had been so long on the road he hadnt an idea what it was an answer to seeing him dumfounded the other concluded him confuted and withdrew calmed the bedrooms were upstairs dungeons with not a scrap of furniture except the bed and a male servant settled inexorably who should sleep with whom neither money nor prayers would get a man a bed to himself here custom forbade it sternly you might as well have asked to monopolize a seesaw they assigned to gerard a man with a great black beard he was an honest fellow enough but not perfect he would not go to bed and would sit on the edge of it telling the wretched gerard by force and at length the events of the day and alternately laughing and crying at the same circumstances which were not in the smallest degree pathetic or humorous but only dead trivial at last gerard put his fingers in his ears and lying down in his clothes for the sheets were too dirty for him to undress contrived to sleep but in an hour or two he awoke cold and found that his drunken companion had got all the feather bed so mighty is instinct they lay between two beds the lower one hard and made of straw the upper soft and filled with feathers light as down gerard pulled at it but the experienced drunkard held it fast mechanically gerard tried to twitch it away by surprise but instinct was too many for him on this he got out of bed and kneeling down on his bedfellows unguarded side easily whipped the prize away and rolled with it under the bed and there lay on one edge of it and curled the rest round his shoulders before he slept he often heard something grumbling and growling above him which was some little satisfaction thus instinct was outwitted and victorious reason lay chuckling on feathers and not quite choked with dust at peep of day gerard rose flung the feather bed upon his snoring companion and went in search of milk and air a cheerful voice hailed him in french what ho you are up with the sun comrade he rises betimes that lies in a dogs lair answered gerard crossly courage lami le diable est mort was the instant reply the soldier then told him his name was denys and he was passing from flushing in zealand to the dukes french dominions a change the more agreeable to him as he should revisit his native place and a host of pretty girls who had wept at his departure and should hear french spoken again and who are you and whither bound my name is gerard and i am going to rome said the more reserved hollander and in a way that invited no further confidences all the better we will go together as far as burgundy that is not my road all roads take to rome ay but the shortest road thither is my way well then it is i who must go out of my way a step for the sake of good company for thy face likes me and thou speakest french or nearly there go two words to that bargain said gerard coldly i steer by proverbs too they do put old heads on young mens shoulders bon loup mauvais compagnon dit le brebis and a soldier they say is near akin to a wolf they lie said denys besides if he is les loups ne se mangent pas entre eux aye but sir soldier i am not a wolf and thou knowest a bien petite occasion se saisit le loup du mouton let us drop wolves and sheep being men my meaning is that a good soldier never pillagesa comrade come young man too much suspicion becomes not your years they who travel should learn to read faces methinks you might see lealty in mine sith i have seen it in yourn is it yon fat purse at your girdle you fear for gerard turned pale look hither and he undid his belt and poured out of it a double handful of gold pieces then returned them to their hidingplace there is a hostage for you said he carry you that and let us be comrades and handed him his belt gold and all gerard stared if i am over prudent you have not enow but he flushed and looked pleased at the others trust in him bah i can read faces and so must you or youll never take your four bones safe to rome soldier you would find me a dull companion for my heart is very heavy said gerard yielding ill cheer you mon gars i think you would said gerard sweetly and sore need have i of a kindly voice in mine ear this day oh no soul is sad alongside me i lift up their poor little hearts with my consigne courage tout le monde le diable est mort ha ha so be it then said gerard but take back your belt for i could never trust by halves we will go together as far as rhine and god go with us both amen said denys and lifted his cap en avant the pair trudged manfully on and denys enlivened the weary way he chattered about battles and sieges and things which were new to gerard and he was one of those who make little incidents wherever they go he passed nobody without addressing them they dont understand it but it wakes them up said he but whenever they fell in with a monk or priest he pulled a long face and sought the reverend fathers blessing and fearlessly poured out on him floods of german words in such order as not to produce a single german sentencehe doffed his cap to every woman high or low he caught sight of and with eagle eye discerned her best feature and complimented her on it in his native tongue well adapted to such matters and at each carrion crow or magpie down came his crossbow and he would go a furlong off the road to circumvent it and indeed he did shoot one old crow with laudable neatness and despatch and carried it to the nearest henroost and there slipped in and set it upon a nest the goodwife will say alack here is beelzebub ahatching of my eggs no you forget he is dead objected gerard so he is so he is but she doesnt know that not having the luck to be acquainted with me who carry the good news from city to city uplifting mens hearts such was denys in time of peace our travellers towards nightfall reached a village it was a very small one but contained a place of entertainment they searched for it and found a small house with barn and stables in the former was the everlasting stove and the clothes drying round it on lines and a traveller or two sitting morose gerard asked for supper supper we have no time to cook for travellers we only provide lodging good lodging for man and beast you can have some beer madman who born in holland sought other lands snorted gerard in dutch the landlady started what gibberish is that asked she and crossed herself with looks of superstitious alarm you can buy what you like in the village and cook it in our oven but prithee mutter no charms nor sorceries here good man dont ye now it do make my flesh creep so they scoured the village for food and ended by supping on roasted eggs and brown bread at a very early hour their chambermaid came for them it was a rosycheeked old fellow with a lanthorn they followed him he led them across a dirty farmyard where they had much ado to pick their steps and brought them into a cowhouse there on each side of every cow was laid a little clean straw and a tied bundle of ditto for a pillow the old man looked down on this his work with paternal pride not so gerard what do you set christian men to lie among cattle well it is hard upon the poor beasts they have scarce room to turn oh what it is not hard on us then where is the hardship i have lain among them all my life look at me i am fourscore and never had a headache in all my born daysall along of lying among the kye bless your silly head kines breath is ten times sweeter to drink nor christians you try it and he slammed the bedroom door denys where are you whined gerard here on her other side what are you doing i know not but as near as i can guess i think i must be going to sleep what are you at i am saying my prayers forget me not in them is it likely denys i shall soon have done do not go to sleep i want to talk despatch then for i feelaugh like floatingin the sky on a warm cloud denys augh eh hallo is it time to get up alack no there i hurried my orisons to talk and look at you going to sleep we shall be starved before morning having no coverlets well you know what to do not i in sooth cuddle the cow thank you burrow in the straw then you must be very new to the world to grumble at this how would you bear to lie on the field of battle on a frosty night as i did tother day stark naked with nothing to keep me warm but the carcass of a fellow i had been and helped kill horrible horrible tell me all about it oh but this is sweet well we had a little battle in brabant and won a little victory but it cost us dear several arbalestriers turned their toes up and i among them killed denys come now dead as mutton stuck full of pikeholes till the blood ran out of me like the good wine of macon from the trodden grapes it is right bounteous in me to pour the tale in minstrel phrase foraughi am sleepy aughnow where was i left dead on the field of battle bleeding like a pig that is to say like grapes or something go on prithee go on tis a sin to sleep in the midst of a good story granted well some of those vagabonds that strip the dead soldier on the field of glory came and took every rag off me they wrought me no further ill because there was no need no you were dead cest convenu this must have been at sundown and with the night came a shrewd frost that barkened the blood on my wounds and stopped all the rivulets that were running from my heart and about midnight i awoke as from a trance and thought you were in heaven asked gerard eagerly being a youth inoculated with monkish tales too frostbitten for that mon gars besides i heard the wounded groaning on all sides so i knew i was in the old place i saw i could not live the night through without cover i groped about shivering and shivering at last one did suddenly leave groaning you are sped said i so made up to him and true enough he was dead but warm you know i took my lord in my arms but was too weak to carry him so rolled with him into a ditch hard by and there my comrades found me in the morning properly stung with nettles and hugging a dead fleming for the bare life gerard shuddered and this is war this is the chosen theme of poets and troubadours and reden ryckers truly was it said by the men of old dulce bellum inexpertis tu dis i sayoh what stout hearts some men have nestce pas ptit so after that sortthingthis sort thing is heaven softwarmgood company comradancowcouagediablemornk and the glib tongue was still for some hours in the morning gerard was wakened by a liquid hitting his eye and it was denys employing the cows udder as a squirt oh fie cried gerard to waste the good milk and he took a horn out of his wallet fill this but indeed i see not what right we have to meddle with her milk at all make your mind easy last night la camarade was not nice but what then true friendship dispenses with ceremony today we make as free with her why what did she do poor thing ate my pillow ha ha on waking i had to hunt for my head and found it down in the stable gutter she ate our pillow from us we drink our pillow from her a votre sante madame et sans rancune and the dog drank her milk to her own health the ancient was right though said gerard never have i risen so refreshed since i left my native land henceforth let us shun great towns and still lie in a convent or a cowhouse for id liever sleep on fresh straw than on linen well washed six months agone and the breath of kine it is sweeter than that of christians let alone the garlic which men and women folk affect but cowen abhor from and so do i st bavon be my witness the soldier eyed him from head to foot now but for that little tuft on your chin i should take you for a girl and by the fingernails of st luke no illfavoured one neither these three towns proved types and repeated themselves with slight variations for many a weary league but even when he could get neither a convent nor a cowhouse gerard learned in time to steel himself to the inevitable and to emulate his comrade whom he looked on as almost superhuman for hardihood of body and spirit there was however a balance to all this veneration denys like his predecessor achilles had his weak part his very weak part thought gerard his foible was woman whatever he was saying or doing he stopped short at sight of a farthingale and his whole soul became occupied with that garment and its inmate till they had disappeared and sometimes for a good while after he often put gerard to the blush by talking his amazing german to such females as he caught standing or sitting indoors or out at which they stared and when he met a peasant girl on the road he took off his cap to her and saluted her as if she was a queen the invariable effect of which was that she suddenly drew herself up quite stiff like a soldier on parade and wore a forbidding countenance they drive me to despair said denys is that a just return to a civil bonnetade they are large they are fair but stupid as swans what breeding can you expect from women that wear no hose inquired gerard and some of them no shoon they seem to me reserved and modest as becomes their sex and sober whereas the men are little better than beerbarrels would you have them brazen as well as hoseless a little affability adorns even beauty sighed denys then let these alone sith they are not to your taste retorted gerard what is there no sweet face in burgundy that would pale to see you so wrapped up in strange women halfadozen that would cry their eyes out well then but it is a long way to burgundy ay to the foot but not to the heart i am there sleeping and waking and almost every minute of the day in burgundy why i thought you had never in burgundy cried gerard contemptuously no in sweet sevenbergen ah welladay welladay many such dialogues as this passed between the pair on the long and weary road and neither could change the other one day about noon they reached a town of some pretensions and gerard was glad for he wanted to buy a pair of shoes his own were quite worn out they soon found a shop that displayed a goodly array and made up to it and would have entered it but the shopkeeper sat on the doorstep taking a nap and was so fat as to block up the narrow doorway the very light could hardly struggle past his too too solid flesh much less a carnal customer my fair readers accustomed when they go shopping to be met half way with nods and becks and wreathed smiles and waved into a seat while almost at the same instant an eager shopman flings himself half across the counter in a semicircle to learn their commands can best appreciate this mediaeval teuton who kept a shop as a dog keeps a kennel and sat at the exclusion of custom snoring like a pig denys and gerard stood and contemplated this curiosity emblem permit me to remark of the lets and hindrances to commerce that characterized his epoch jump over him the door is too low march through him the man is too thick what is the coil inquired a mumbling voice from the interior apprentice with his mouth full we want to get into your shop what for in heavens name shoon lazy bones the ire of the apprentice began to rise at such an explanation and could ye find no hour out of all the twelve to come pestering us for shoon but the one little little hour my master takes his nap and i sit down to my dinner when all the rest of the world is full long ago denys heard but could not follow the sense waste no more time talking their german gibberish said he take out thy knife and tickle his fat ribs that i will not said gerard then here goes ill prong him with this gerard seized the mad fellows arm in dismay for he had been long enough in the country to guess that the whole town would take part in any brawl with the native against a stranger but denys twisted away from him and the crossbow bolt in his hand was actually on the road to the sleepers ribs but at that very moment two females crossed the road towards him he saw the blissful vision and instantly forgot what he was about and awaited their approach with unreasonable joy though companions they were not equals except in attractiveness to a burgundian crossbow man for one was very tall the other short and by one of those anomalies which society however primitive speedily establishes the long one held up the little ones tail the tall one wore a plain linen coif on her head a little grogram cloak over her shoulders a grey kirtle and a short farthingale or petticoat of bright red cloth and feet and legs quite bare though her arms were veiled in tight linen sleeves the other a kirtle broadly trimmed with fur her arms in double sleeves whereof the inner of yellow satin clung to the skin the outer all befurred were open at the inside of the elbow and so the arm passed through and left them dangling velvet headdress huge purse at girdle gorgeous train bare legs and thus they came on the citizens wife strutting and the maid gliding after holding her mistresss train devoutly in both hands and bending and winding her lithe body prettily enough to do it imagine if not pressed for time a bantam with a guineahen stepping obsequious at its stately heel this pageant made straight for the shoemakers shop denys louted low the worshipful lady nodded graciously but rapidly having business on hand or rather on foot for in a moment she poked the point of her little shoe into the sleeper and worked it round in him like a gimlet till with a long snarl he woke the incarnate shutter rising and grumbling vaguely the lady swept in and deigned him no further notice he retreated to his neighbours shop the tailors and sitting on the step protected it from the impertinence of morning calls neighbours should be neighbourly denys and gerard followed the dignity into the shop where sat the apprentice at dinner the maid stood outside with her insteps crossed leaning against the wall and tapping it with her nails those yonder said the dignity briefly pointing with an imperious little white hand to some yellow shoes gilded at the toe while the apprentice stood stock still neutralized by his dinner and his duty denys sprang at the shoes and brought them to her she smiled and calmly seating herself protruded her foot shod but hoseless and scented down went denys on his knees and drew off her shoe and tried the new ones on the white skin devoutly finding she had a willing victim she abused the opportunity tried first one pair then another then the first again and so on balancing and hesitating for about half an hour to gerards disgust and denyss weak delight at last she was fitted and handed two pair of yellow and one pair of red shoes out to her servant then was heard a sigh it burst from the owner of the shop he had risen from slumber and was now hovering about like a partridge near her brood in danger there go all my coloured shoes said he as they disappeared in the girls apron the lady departed gerard fitted himself with a stout pair asked the price paid it without a word and gave his old ones to a beggar in the street who blessed him in the marketplace and threw them furiously down a well in the suburbs the comrades left the shop and in it two melancholy men that looked and even talked as if they had been robbed wholesale my shoon are sore worn said denys grinding his teeth but ill go barefoot till i reach france ere ill leave my money with such churls as these the dutchman replied calmly they seem indifferent well sewn as they drew near the rhine they passed through forest after forest and now for the first time ugly words sounded in travellers mouths seated around stoves thieves black gangs cutthroats etc the very rustics were said to have a custom hereabouts of murdering the unwary traveller in these gloomy woods whose dark and devious winding enabled those who were familiar with them to do deeds of rapine and blood undetected or if detected easily to baffle pursuit certain it was that every clown they met carried whether for offence or defence a most formidable weapon a light axe with a short pike at the head and a long slender handle of ash or yew well seasoned these the natives could all throw with singular precision so as to make the point strike an object at several yards distance or could slay a bullock at hand with a stroke of the blade gerard bought one and practised with it denys quietly filed and ground his bolt sharp whistling the whilst and when they entered a gloomy wood he would unsling his crossbow and carry it ready for action but not so much like a traveller fearing an attack as a sportsman watchful not to miss a snap shot one day being in a forest a few leagues from dusseldorf as gerard was walking like one in a dream thinking of margaret and scarce seeing the road he trode his companion laid a hand on his shoulder and strung his crossbow with glittering eye hush said he in a low whisper that startled gerard more than thunder gerard grasped his axe tight and shook a little he heard a rustling in the wood hard by and at the same moment denys sprang into the wood and his crossbow went to his shoulder even as he jumped twang went the metal string and after an instants suspense he roared run forward guard the road he is hit he is hit gerard darted forward and as he ran a young bear burst out of the wood right upon him finding itself intercepted it went upon its hind legs with a snarl and though not half grown opened formidable jaws and long claws gerard in a fury of excitement and agitation flung himself on it and delivered a tremendous blow on its nose with his axe and the creature staggered another and it lay grovelling with gerard hacking it hallo stop you are mad to spoil the meat i took it for a robber said gerard panting i mean i had made ready for a robber so i could not hold my hand ay these chattering travellers have stuffed your head full of thieves and assassins they have not got a real live robber in their whole nation nay ill carry the beast bear thou my crossbow we will carry it by turns then said gerard for tis a heavy load poor thing how its blood drips why did we slay it for supper and the reward the baillie of the next town shall give us and for that it must die when it had but just begun to live and perchance it hath a mother that will miss it sore this night and loves it as ours love us more than mine does me what know you not that his mother was caught in a pitfall last month and her skin is now at the tanners and his father was stuck full of clothyard shafts tother day and died like julius caesar with his hands folded on his bosom and a dead dog in each of them but gerard would not view it jestingly why then said he we have killed one of gods creatures that was all alone in the worldas i am this day in this strange land you young milksop roared denys these things must not be looked at so or not another bow would be drawn nor quarrel fly in forest nor battlefield why one of your kidney consorting with a troop of pikemen should turn them to a row of milkpails it is ended to rome thou goest not alone for never wouldst thou reach the alps in a whole skin i take thee to remiremont my native place and there i marry thee to my young sister she is blooming as a peach thou shakest thy head ah i forgot thou lovest elsewhere and art a one woman man a creature to me scarce conceivable well then i shall find thee not a wife nor a leman but a friend some honest burgundian who shall go with thee as far as lyons and much i doubt that honest fellow will be myself into whose liquor thou has dropped sundry powders to make me love thee for erst i endured not doves in doublet and hose from lyons i say i can trust thee by ship to italy which being by all accounts the very stronghold of milksops thou wilt there be safe they will hear thy words and make thee their duke in a twinkling gerard sighed in sooth i love not to think of this dusseldorf where we are to part company good friend they walked silently each thinking of the separation at hand the thought checked trifling conversation and at these moments it is a relief to do something however insignificant gerard asked denys to lend him a bolt i have often shot with a long bow but never with one of these draw thy knife and cut this one out of the cub said denys slily nay day i want a clean one denys gave him three out of his quiver gerard strung the bow and levelled it at a bough that had fallen into the road at some distance the power of the instrument surprised him the short but thick steel bow jarred him to the very heel as it went off and the swift steel shaft was invisible in its passage only the dead leaves with which november had carpeted the narrow road flew about on the other side of the bough ye aimed a thought too high said denys what a deadly thing no wonder it is driving out the longbowto martins much discontent ay lad said denys triumphantly it gains ground every day in spite of their laws and their proclamations to keep up the yewen bow because forsooth their grandsires shot with it knowing no better you see gerard war is not pastime men will shoot at their enemies with the hittingest arm and the killingest not with the longest and missingest then these new engines i hear of will put both bows down for these with a pinch of black dust and a leaden ball and a childs finger shall slay you mars and goliath and the seven champions pooh pooh said denys warmly petrone nor harquebuss shall ever put down sir arbalest why we can shoot ten times while they are putting their charcoal and their lead into their leathern smoke belchers and then kindling their matches all that is too fumbling for the field of battle there a soldiers weapon needs be aye ready like his heart gerard did not answer for his ear was attracted by a sound behind them it was a peculiar sound too like something heavy but not hard rushing softly over the dead leaves he turned round with some little curiosity a colossal creature was coming down the road at about sixty paces distance he looked at it in a sort of calm stupor at first but the next moment he turned ashy pale denys he cried oh god denys denys whirled round it was a bear as big as a carthorse it was tearing along with its huge head down running on a hot scent the very moment he saw it denys said in a sickening whisper the cub oh the concentrated horror of that one word whispered hoarsely with dilating eyes for in that syllable it all flashed upon them both like a sudden stroke of lightning in the darkthe bloody trail the murdered cub the mother upon them and it death all this in a moment of time the next she saw them huge as she was she seemed to double herself it was her long hair bristling with rage she raised her head big as a hulls her swineshaped jaws opened wide at them her eyes turned to blood and flame and she rushed upon them scattering the leaves about her like a whirlwind as she came shoot screamed denys but gerard stood shaking from head to foot useless shoot man ten thousand devils shoot too late tree tree and he dropped the cub pushed gerard across the road and flew to the first tree and climbed it gerard the same on his side and as they fled both men uttered inhuman howls like savage creatures grazed by death with all their speed one or other would have been torn to fragments at the foot of his tree but the bear stopped a moment at the cub without taking her bloodshot eyes off those she was hunting she smelt it all round and found how her creator only knows that it was dead quite dead she gave a yell such as neither of the hunted ones had ever heard nor dreamed to be in nature and flew after denys she reared and struck at him as he climbed he was just out of reach instantly she seized the tree and with her huge teeth tore a great piece out of it with a crash then she reared again dug her claws deep into the bark and began to mount it slowly but as surely as a monkey denyss evil star had led him to a dead tree a mere shaft and of no very great height he climbed faster than his pursuer and was soon at the top he looked this way and that for some bough of another tree to spring to there was none and if he jumped down he knew the bear would be upon him ere he could recover the fall and make short work of him moreover denys was little used to turning his back on danger and his blood was rising at being hunted he turned to bay my hour is come thought he let me meet death like a man he kneeled down and grasped a small shoot to steady himself drew his long knife and clenching his teeth prepared to jab the huge brute as soon as it should mount within reach of this combat the result was not doubtful the monsters head and neck were scarce vulnerable for bone and masses of hair the man was going to sting the bear and the bear to crack the man like a nut gerards heart was better than his nerves he saw his friends mortal danger and passed at once from fear to blindish rage he slipped down his tree in a moment caught up the crossbow which he had dropped in the road and running furiously up sent a bolt into the bears body with a loud shout the bear gave a snarl of rage and pain and turned its head irresolutely keep aloof cried denys or you are a dead man i care not and in a moment he had another bolt ready and shot it fiercely into the bear screaming take that take that denys poured a volley of oaths down at him get away idiot he was right the bear finding so formidable and noisy a foe behind her slipped growling down the tree rending deep furrows in it as she slipped gerard ran back to his tree and climbed it swiftly but while his legs were dangling some eight feet from the ground the bear came rearing and struck with her fore paw and out flew a piece of bloody cloth from gerards hose he climbed and climbed and presently he heard as it were in the air a voice say go out on the bough he looked and there was a long massive branch before him shooting upwards at a slight angle he threw his body across it and by a series of convulsive efforts worked up it to the end then he looked round panting the bear was mounting the tree on the other side he heard her claws scrape and saw her bulge on both sides of the massive tree her eye not being very quick she reached the fork and passed it mounting the main stem gerard drew breath more freely the bear either heard him or found by scent she was wrong she paused presently she caught sight of him she eyed him steadily then quietly descended to the fork slowly and cautiously she stretched out a paw and tried the bough it was a stiff oak branch sound as iron instinct taught the creature this it crawled carefully out on the bough growling savagely as it came gerard looked wildly down he was forty feet from the ground death below death moving slow but sure on him in a still more horrible form his hair bristled the sweat poured from him he sat helpless fascinated tonguetied as the fearful monster crawled growling towards him incongruous thoughts coursed through his mind margaret the vulgate where it speaks of the rage of a shebear robbed of her whelpsromeeternity the bear crawled on and now the stupor of death fell on the doomed man he saw the open jaws and bloodshot eyes coming but in a mist as in a mist he heard a twang he glanced down denys white and silent as death was shooting up at the bear the bear snarled at the twang but crawled on again the crossbow twanged and the bear snarled and came nearer again the cross bow twanged and the next moment the bear was close upon gerard where he sat with hair standing stiff on end and eyes starting from their sockets palsied the bear opened her jaws like a grave and hot blood spouted from them upon gerard as from a pump the bough rocked the wounded monster was reeling it clung it stuck its sickles of claws deep into the wood it toppled its claws held firm but its body rolled off and the sudden shock to the branch shook gerard forward on his stomach with his face upon one of the bears straining paws at this by a convulsive effort she raised her head up up till he felt her hot fetid breath then huge teeth snapped together loudly close below him in the air with a last effort of baffled hate the ponderous carcass rent the claws out of the bough then pounded the earth with a tremendous thump there was a shout of triumph below and the very next instant a cry of dismay for gerard had swooned and without an attempt to save himself rolled headlong from the perilous height chapter xxv denys caught at gerard and somewhat checked his fall but it may be doubted whether this alone would have saved him from breaking his neck or a limb his best friend now was the dying bear on whose hairy carcass his head and shoulders descended denys tore him off her it was needless she panted still and her limbs quivered but a hare was not so harmless and soon she breathed her last and the judicious denys propped gerard up against her being soft and fanned him he came to by degrees but confused and feeling the bear around him rolled away yelling courage cried denys le diable est mort is it dead quite dead inquired gerard from behind a tree for his courage was feverish and the cold fit was on him just now and had been for some time behold said denys and pulled the brutes ear playfully and opened her jaws and put in his head with other insulting antics in the midst of which gerard was violently sick denys laughed at him what is the matter now said he also why tumble off your perch just when we had won the day i swooned i trow but why not receiving an answer he continued green girls faint as soon as look at you but then they choose time and place what woman ever fainted up a tree she sent her nasty blood all over me i think the smell must have overpowered me faugh i hate blood i do believe it potently see what a mess she has made me but with her blood not yours i pity the enemy that strives to satisfy you you need not to brag maitre denys i saw you under the tree the colour of your shirt let us distinguish said denys colouring it is permitted to tremble for a friend gerard for answer flung his arms round denyss neck in silence look here whined the stout soldier affected by this little gush of nature and youth was ever aught so like a woman i love thee little milksopgo to good behold him on his knees now what new caprice is this oh denys ought we not to return thanks to him who has saved both our lives against such fearful odds and gerard kneeled and prayed aloud and presently he found denys kneeling quiet beside him with his hands across his bosom after the custom of his nation and a face as long as his arm when they rose gerards countenance was beaming good denys said he heaven will reward thy piety ah bah i did it out of politeness said the frenchman it was to please thee little one cest egal twas well and orderly prayed and edified me to the core while it lasted a bishop had scarce handled the matter better so now our evensong being sung and the saints enlisted with usmarchons ere they had taken two steps he stopped bytheby the cub oh no no cried gerard you are right it is late we have lost time climbing trees and tumbling off em and swooning and vomiting and praying and the brute is heavy to carry and now i think ont we shall have papa after it next these bears make such a coil about an odd cub what is this you are wounded you are wounded not i he is wounded miserable that i am be calm denys i am not touched i feel no pain anywhere you you only feel when another is hurt cried denys with great emotion and throwing himself on his knees he examined gerards leg with glistening eyes quick quick before it stiffens he cried and hurried him on who makes the coil about nothing now inquired gerard composedly denyss reply was a very indirect one be pleased to note said he that i have a bad heart you were man enough to save my life yet i must sneer at you a novice in war was not i a novice once myself then you fainted from a wound and i thought you swooned for fear and called you a milksop briefly i have a bad tongue and a bad heart denys plaitil you lie you are very good to say so little one and i am eternally obliged to you mumbled the remorseful denys ere they had walked many furlongs the muscles of the wounded leg contracted and stiffened till presently gerard could only just put his toe to the ground and that with great pain at last he could bear it no longer let me lie down and die he groaned for this is intolerable denys represented that it was afternoon and the nights were now frosty and cold and hunger ill companions and that it would be unreasonable to lose heart a certain great personage being notoriously defunct so gerard leaned upon his axe and hobbled on but presently he gave in all of a sudden and sank helpless in the road denys drew him aside into the wood and to his surprise gave him his crossbow and bolts enjoining him strictly to lie quiet and if any illlooking fellows should find him out and come to him to bid them keep aloof and should they refuse to shoot them dead at twenty paces honest men keep the path and knaves in a wood none but fools do parley with them with this he snatched up gerards axe and set off runningnot as gerard expected towards dusseldorf but on the road they had come gerard lay aching and smarting and to him rome that seemed so near at starting looked far far off now that he was two hundred miles nearer it but soon all his thoughts turned sevenbergenwards how sweet it would be one day to hold margarets hand and tell her all he had gone through for her the very thought of it and her soothed him and in the midst of pain and irritation of the nerves be lay resigned and sweetly though faintly smiling he had lain thus more than two hours when suddenly there were shouts and the next moment something struck a tree hard by and quivered in it he looked it was an arrow he started to his feet several missiles rattled among the boughs and the wood echoed with battlecries whence they came he could not tell for noises in these huge woods are so reverberated that a stranger is always at fault as to their whereabout but they seemed to fill the whole air presently there was a lull then he heard the fierce galloping of hoofs and still louder shouts and cries arose mingled with shrieks and groans and above all strange and terrible sounds like fierce claps of thunder bellowing loud and then dying off in cracking echoes and red tongues of flame shot out ever and anon among the trees and clouds of sulphurous smoke came drifting over his head and all was still gerard was struck with awe what will become of denys he cried oh why did you leave me oh denys my friend my friend just before sunset denys returned almost sinking under a hairy bundle it was the bears skin gerard welcomed him with a burst of joy that astonished him i thought never to see you again dear denys were you in the battle no what battle the bloody battle of men or fiends that raged in the wood a while agone and with this he described it to the life and more fully than i have done denys patted him indulgently on the back it is well said he thou art a good limner and fever is a great spur to the imagination one day i lay in a cartshed with a cracked skull and saw two hosts manoeuvre and fight a good hour on eight feet square the which i did fairly describe to my comrade in due order only not so gorgeously as thou for want of book learning what then you believe me not when i tell you the arrows whizzed over my head and the combatants shouted and may the foul fiends fly away with me if i believe a word of it gerard took his arm and quietly pointed to a tree close by why it looks likeit isa broad arrow as i live and he went close and looked up at it it came out of the battle i heard it and saw it an english arrow how know you that marry by its length the english bowmen draw the bow to the ear others only to the right breast hence the english loose a threefoot shaft and this is one of them perdition seize them well if this is not glamour there has been a trifle of a battle and if there has been a battle in so ridiculous a place for a battle as this why then tis no business of mine for my duke hath no quarrel hereabouts so lets to bed said the professional and with this he scraped together a heap of leaves and made gerard lie on it his axe by his side he then lay down beside him with one hand on his arbalest and drew the bearskin over them hair inward they were soon as warm as toast and fast asleep but long before the dawn gerard woke his comrade what shall i do denys i die of famine do why go to sleep again incontinent qui dort dine but i tell you i am too hungry to sleep snapped gerard let us march then replied denys with paternal indulgence he had a brief paroxysm of yawns then made a small bundle of bears ears rolling them up in a strip of the skin cut for the purpose and they took the road gerard leaned on his axe and propped by denys on the other side hobbled along not without sighs i hate pain said gerard viciously therein you show judgment replied papa smoothly it was a clear starlight night and soon the moon rising revealed the end of the wood at no great distance a pleasant sight since dusseldorf they knew was but a short league further at the edge of the wood they came upon something so mysterious that they stopped to gaze at it before going up to it two white pillars rose in the air distant a few paces from each other and between them stood many figures that looked like human forms i go no farther till i know what this is said gerard in an agitated whisper are they effigies of the saints for men to pray to on the road or live robbers waiting to shoot down honest travellers nay living men they cannot be for they stand on nothing that i see oh denys let us turn back till daybreak this is no mortal sight denys halted and peered long and keenly they are men said he at last gerard was for turning back all the more but men that will never hurt us nor we them look not to their feet for that they stand on where then i the name of all the saints look over their heads said denys gravely following this direction gerard presently discerned the outline of a dark wooden beam passing from pillar to pillar and as the pair got nearer walking now on tiptoe one by one dark snakelike cords came out in the moonlight each pendent from the beam to a dead man and tight as wire now as they came under this awful monument of crime and wholesale vengeance a light air swept by and several of the corpses swung or gently gyrated and every rope creaked gerard shuddered at this ghastly salute so thoroughly had the gibbet with its sickening load seized and held their eyes that it was but now they perceived a fire right underneath and a living figure sitting huddled over it his axe lay beside him the bright blade shining red in the glow he was asleep gerard started but denys only whispered courage comrade here is a fire ay but there is a man at it there will soon be three and he began to heap some wood on it that the watcher had prepared during which the prudent gerard seized the mans axe and sat down tight on it grasping his own and examining the sleeper there was nothing outwardly distinctive in the man he wore the dress of the country folk and the hat of the district a threecornered hat called a brunswicker stiff enough to turn a sword cut and with a thick brass hatband the weight of the whole thing had turned his ears entirely down like a fancy rabbits in our century but even this though it spoiled him as a man was nothing remarkable they had of late met scores of these dogseared rustics the peculiarity was this clown watching under a laden gallows what for denys if he felt curious would not show it he took out two bears ears from his bundle and running sticks through them began to toast them twill be eating coined money said he for the burgomaster of dusseldorf had given us a rixdollar for these ears as proving the death of their owners but better a lean purse than a lere stomach unhappy man cried gerard could you eat food here where the fire is lighted there must the meat roast and where it roasts there must it be eaten for nought travels worse than your roasted meat well eat thou denys an thou canst but i am cold and sick there is no room for hunger in my heart after what mine eyes have seen and he shuddered over the fire oh how they creak and who is this man i wonder what an illfavoured churl denys examined him like a connoisseur looking at a picture and in due course delivered judgment i take him to be of the refuse of that company whereof these pointing carelessly upward were the cream and so ran their heads into danger at that rate why not stun him before he wakes and gerard fidgeted where he sat denys opened his eyes with humorous surprise for one who sets up for a milksop you have the readiest hand why should two stun one tush he wakes note now what he says at waking and tell me these last words were hardly whispered when the watcher opened his eyes at sight of the fire made up and two strangers eyeing him keenly he stared and there was a severe and pretty successful effort to be calm still a perceptible tremor ran all over him soon he manned himself and said gruffly good morrow but at the very moment of saying it he missed his axe and saw how gerard was sitting upon it with his own laid ready to his hand he lost countenance again directly denys smiled grimly at this bit of byplay good morrow said gerard quietly keeping his eye on him the watcher was now too ill at ease to be silent you make free with my fire said he but he added in a somewhat faltering voice you are welcome denys whispered gerard the watcher eyed them askant my comrade says sith we share your fire you shall share his meat so be it said the man warmly i have half a kid hanging on a bush hard by ill go fetch it and he arose with a cheerful and obliging countenance and was retiring denys caught up his crossbow and levelled it at his head the man fell on his knees denys lowered his weapon and pointed him back to his place he rose and went back slowly and unsteadily like one disjointed and sick at heart as the mouse that the cat lets go a little way and then darts and replaces sit down friend said denys grimly in french the man obeyed finger and tone though he knew not a word of french tell him the fire is not big enough for more than thee he will take my meaning this being communicated by gerard the man grinned ever since denys spoke he had seemed greatly relieved i wist not ye were strangers said he to gerard denys cut a piece of bears ear and offered it with grace to him he had just levelled crossbow at he took it calmly and drew a piece of bread from his wallet and divided it with the pair nay more he winked and thrust his hand into the heap of leaves he sat on gerard grasped his axe ready to brain him and produced a leathern bottle holding full two gallons he put it to his mouth and drank their healths then handed it to gerard he passed it untouched to denys mort de ma vie cried the soldier it is rhenish wine and fit for the gullet of an archbishop heres to thee thou prince of good fellows wishing thee a short life and a merry one come gerard sup sup pshaw never heed them man they heed not thee natheless did i hang over such a skin of rhenish as this and three churls sat beneath a drinking it and offered me not a drop id soon be down among them denys denys my spirit would cut the cord and womp would come my body amongst ye with a hand on the bottle and one eye winking tother gerard started up with a cry of horror and his fingers to his ears and was running from the place when his eye fell on the watchers axe the tangible danger brought him back he sat down again on the axe with his fingers in his ears courage lami le diable est mort shouted denys gaily and offered him a piece of bears ear put it right under his nose as he stopped his ears gerard turned his head away with loathing wine he gasped heaven knows i have much need of it with such companions as thee and he took a long draught of the rhenish wine it ran glowing through his veins and warmed and strengthened his heart but could not check his tremors whenever a gust of wind came as for denys and the other they feasted recklessly and plied the bottle unceasingly and drank healths and caroused beneath that creaking sepulchre and its ghastly tenants ask him how they came here said denys with his mouth full and pointing up without looking on this question being interpreted to the watcher he replied that treason had been their end diabolical treason and priestcraft he then being rendered communicative by drink delivered a long prosy narrative the purport of which was as follows these honest gentlemen who now dangled here so miserably were all stout men and true and lived in the forest by their wits their independence and thriving state excited the jealousy and hatred of a large portion of mankind and many attempts were made on their lives and liberties these the virgin and their patron saints coupled with their individual skill and courage constantly baffled but yester eve a party of merchants came slowly on their mules from dusseldorf the honest men saw them crawling and let them penetrate near a league into the forest then set upon them to make them disgorge a portion of their illgotten gains but alas the merchants were no merchants at all but soldiers of more than one nation in the pay of the archbishop of cologne haubergeons had they beneath their gowns and weapons of all sorts at hand natheless the honest men fought stoutly and pressed the traitors hard when lo horsemen that had been planted in ambush many hours before galloped up and with these new diabolical engines of war shot leaden bullets and laid many an honest fellow low and so quelled the courage of others that they yielded them prisoners these being taken redhanded the victors who with malice inconceivable had brought cords knotted round their waists did speedily hang and by their side the dead ones to make the gallanter show that one at the end was the captain he never felt the cord he was riddled with broad arrows and leaden balls or ever they could take him a worthy man as ever cried stand and deliver but a little hasty not much stay i forgot he is dead very hasty and obstinate as a pig that one in thebuff jerkin is the lieutenant as good a soul as ever lived he was hanged alive this one here i never could abide no not that one that is conrad my bosom friend i mean this one right overhead in the chickentoed shoon you were always carrying tales ye thief and making mischief you know you were and sirs i am a man that would rather live united in a coppice than in a forest with backbiters and talebearers strangers i drink to you and so he went down the whole string indicating with the neck of the bottle like a showman with his pole and giving a neat description of each which though pithy was invariably false for the showman had no real eye for character and had misunderstood every one of these people enough palaver cried denys marchons give me his axe now tell him he must help you along the mans countenance fell but he saw in denyss eye that resistance would be dangerous he submitted gerard it was who objected he said y pensezvous to put my hand on a thief it maketh my flesh creep childishness all trades must live besides i have my reasons be not you wiser than your elder no only if i am to lean on him i must have my hand in my bosom still grasping the haft of my knife it is a new attitude to walk in but please thyself and in that strange and mixed attitude of tender offices and deadly suspicion the trio did walk i wish i could draw themi would not trust to the pen the light of the watchtower at dusseldorf was visible as soon as they cleared the wood and cheered gerard when after an hours march the black outline of the tower itself and other buildings stood out clear to the eye their companion halted and said gloomily you may as well slay me out of hand as take me any nearer the gates of dusseldorf town on this being communicated to denys he said at once let him go then for in sooth his neck will be in jeopardy if he wends much further with us gerard acquiesced as a matter of course his horror of a criminal did not in the least dispose him to active cooperation with the law but the fact is that at this epoch no private citizen in any part of europe ever meddled with criminals but in selfdefence except bytheby in england which behind other nations in some things was centuries before them all in this the mans personal liberty being restored he asked for his axe it was given him to the friends surprise he still lingered was he to have nothing for coming so far out of his way with them here are two batzen friend add the wine the good rhenish did you give aught for it ay the peril of my life hum what say you denys i say it was worth its weight in gold here lad here be silver groshen one for every acorn on that gallows tree and here is one more for thee who wilt doubtless be there in due season the man took the coins but still lingered well what now cried gerard who thought him shamefully overpaid already dost seek the hide off our bones nay good sirs but you have seen tonight how parlous a life is mine ye be true men and your prayers avail give me then a small trifle of a prayer ant please you for i know not one gerards choler began to rise at the egotistical rogue moreover ever since his wound he had felt gusts of irritability however he bit his lip and said there go two words to that bargain tell me first is it true what men say of you rhenish thieves that ye do murder innocent and unresisting travellers as well as rob them the other answered sulkily they you call thieves are not to blame for that the fault lies with the law gramercy so tis the laws fault that ill men break it i mean not so but the law in this land slays an honest man an if he do but steal what follows he would be pitiful but is discouraged herefrom pity gains him no pity and doubles his peril an he but cut a purse his life is forfeit therefore cutteth he the throat to boot to save his own neck dead men tell no tales pray then for the poor soul who by bloody laws is driven to kill or else be slaughtered were there less of this unreasonable gibbeting on the highroad there should be less enforced cutting of throats in dark woods my masters fewer words had served replied gerard coldly i asked a question i am answered and suddenly doffing his bonnet obsecro deum omnipotentem ut qua cruce jam pendent isti quindecim latrones fures et homicidae in ea homicida fur et latro tu pependeris quam citissime pro publica salute in honorem justi dei cui sit gloria in aeternum amen and so good day the greedy outlaw was satisfied last that is latin he muttered and more than i bargained for so indeed it was and he returned to his business with a mind at ease the friends pondered in silence the many events of the last few hours at last gerard said thoughtfully that shebear saved both our livesby gods will like enough replied denys and talking of that it was lucky we did not dawdle over our supper what mean you i mean they are not all hanged i saw a refuse of seven or eight as black as ink around our fire when when ere we had left it five minutes good heavens and you said not a word it would but have worried you and had set our friend a looking back and mayhap tempted him to get his skull split all other danger was over they could not see us we were out of the moonshine and indeed just turning a corner ah there is the sun and here are the gates of dusseldorf courage lami le diable est mort my head my head was all poor gerard could reply so many shocks emotions perils horrors added to the wound his first had tried his youthful body and sensitive nature too severely it was noon of the same day in a bedroom of the silver lion the rugged denys sat anxious watching his young friend and he lay raging with fever delirious at intervals and one word for ever on his lips margaretmargaret margaret chapter xxvi it was the afternoon of the next day gerard was no longer lightheaded but very irritable and full of fancies and in one of these he begged denys to get him a lemon to suck denys who from a rough soldier had been turned by tender friendship into a kind of grandfather got up hastily and bidding him set his mind at ease lemons he should have in the twinkling of a quart pot went and ransacked the shops for them they were not so common in the north as they are now and he was absent a long while and gerard getting very impatient when at last the door opened but it was not denys entered softly an imposing figure an old gentleman in a long sober gown trimmed with rich fur cherrycoloured hose and pointed shoes with a sword by his side in a morocco scabbard a ruff round his neck not only starched severely but treacherously stiffened in furrows by rebatoes or a little hidden framework of wood and on his head a fourcornered cap with a fur border on his chin and bosom a majestic white beard gerard was in no doubt as to the vocation of his visitor for the sword excepted this was familiar to him as the full dress of a physician moreover a boy followed at his heels with a basket where phials lint and surgical tools rather courted than shunned observation the old gentleman came softly to the bedside and said mildly and sotto voce how ist with thee my son gerard answered gratefully that his wound gave him little pain now but his throat was parched and his head heavy a wound they told me not of that let me see it ay ay a good clean bite the mastiff had sound teeth that took this out i warrant me and the good doctors sympathy seemed to run off to the quadruped he had conjured his jackal this must be cauterized forthwith or we shall have you starting back from water and turning somersaults in bed under our hands tis the year for raving curs and one hath done your business but we will baffle him yet urchin go heat thine iron but sir edged in gerard twas no dog but a bear a bear young man remonstrated the senior severely think what you say tis ill jesting with the man of art who brings his grey hairs and long study to heal you a bear quotha had you dissected as many bears as i or the tithe and drawn their teeth to keep your hand in you would know that no bears jaw ever made this foolish trifling wound i tell you twas a dog and since you put me to it i even deny that it was a dog of magnitude but neither more nor less than one of these little furious curs that are so rife and run devious biting each manly leg and laying its wearer low but for me and my learned brethren who still stay the mischief with knife and cautery alas sir when said i twas a bears jaw i said a bear it was his paw now and why didst not tell me that at once because you kept telling me instead never conceal aught from your leech young man continued the senior who was a good talker but one of the worst listeners in europe well it is an ill business all the horny excrescences of animals to wit claws of tigers panthers badgers cats bears and the like and horn of deer and nails of humans especially children are imbued with direst poison yhad better have been bitten by a cur whatever you may say than gored by bull or stag or scratched by bear however shalt have a good biting cataplasm for thy leg meantime keep we the body cool put out thy tonguegoodfever let me feel thy pulse goodfever i ordain flebotomy and on the instant flebotomy that is bloodletting humph well no matter if tis sure to cure me for i will not lie idle here the doctor let him know that flebotomy was infallible especially in this case hans go fetch the things needful and i will entertain the patient meantime with reasons the man of art then explained to gerard that in disease the blood becomes hot and distempered and more or less poisonous but a portion of this unhealthy liquid removed nature is fain to create a purer fluid to fill its place bleeding therefore being both a cooler and a purifier was a specific in all diseases for all diseases were febrile whatever empirics might say but think not said he warmly that it suffices to bleed any paltry barber can open a vein though not all can close it again the art is to know what vein to empty for what disease tother day they brought me one tormented with earache i let him blood in the right thigh and away flew his earache bytheby he has died since then another came with the toothache i bled him behind the ear and relieved him in a jiffy he is also since dead as it happens i bled our bailiff between the thumb and forefinger for rheumatism presently he comes to me with a headache and drumming in the ears and holds out his hand over the basin but i smiled at his folly and bled him in the left ankle sore against his will and made his head as light as a nut diverging then from the immediate theme after the manner of enthusiasts the reverend teacher proceeded thus know young man that two schools of art contend at this moment throughout europe the arabian whose ancient oracles are avicenna rhazes albucazis and its revivers are chauliac and lanfranc and the greek school whose modern champions are bessarion platinus and marsilius ficinus but whose pristine doctors were medicines very oracles phoebus chiron aesculapius and his sons podalinus and machaon pythagoras democritus praxagoras who invented the arteries and dioctes qui primus urinae animum dedit all these taught orally then came hippocrates the eighteenth from aesculapius and of him we have manuscripts to him we owe the vital principle he also invented the bandage and tapped for water on the chest and above all he dissected yet only quadrupeds for the brutal prejudices of the pagan vulgar withheld the human body from the knife of science him followed aristotle who gave us the aorta the largest bloodvessel in the human body surely sir the almighty gave us all that is in our bodies and not aristotle nor any grecian man objected gerard humbly child of course he gave us the thing but aristotle did more he gave us the name of the thing but young men will still be talking the next great light was galen he studied at alexandria then the home of science he justly malcontent with quadrupeds dissected apes as coming nearer to man and bled like a trojan then came theophilus who gave us the nerves the lacteal vessels and the pia mater this worried gerard i cannot lie still and hear it said that mortal man bestowed the parts which adam our father took from him who made him of the clay and us his sons was ever such perversity said the doctor his colour rising who is the real donor of a thing to man he who plants it secretly in the dark recesses of mans body or the learned wight who reveals it to his intelligence and so enriches his mind with the knowledge of it comprehension is your only true possession are you answered i am put to silence sir and that is better still for garrulous patients are ill to cure especially in fever i say then that eristratus gave us the cerebral nerves and the milk vessels nay more he was the inventor of lithotomy whatever you may say then came another whom i forget you do somewhat perturb me with your petty exceptions then came ammonius the author of lithotrity and here comes hans with the basinto stay your volubility blow thy chafer boy and hand me the basin tis well arabians quotha what are they but a sect of yesterday who about the year did fall in with the writings of those very greeks and read them awry having no concurrent light of their own for their demigod and cameldriver mahound impostor in science as in religion had strictly forbidden them anatomy even of the lower animals the which he who severeth from medicine tollit solem e mundo as tully quoth nay wonder not at my fervour good youth where the general weal stands in jeopardy a little warmth is civic humane and honourable now there is settled of late in this town a pestilent arabist a mere empiric who despising anatomy and scarce knowing greek from hebrew hath yet spirited away half my patients and i tremble for the rest put forth thine ankle and thou hans breathe on the chafer whilst matters were in this posture in came denys with the lemons and stood surprised what sport is toward said he raising his brows gerard coloured a little and told him the learned doctor was going to flebotomize him and cauterize him that was all ay indeed and yon imp what bloweth he hot coals for what should it be for said the doctor to gerard but to cauterize the vein when opened and the poisonous blood let free tis the only safe way avicenna indeed recommends a ligature of the vein but how tis to be done he saith not nor knew he himself i wot nor any of the spawn of ishmael for me i have no faith in such tricksy expedients and take this with you for a safe principle whatever an arab or arabist says is right must be wrong oh i see now what tis for said denys and art thou so simple as to let him put hot iron to thy living flesh didst ever keep thy little finger but ten moments in a candle and this will be as many minutes art not content to burn in purgatory after thy death must thou needs buy a foretaste ont here i never thought of that said gerard gravely the good doctor spake not of burning but of cautery to be sure tis all one but cautery sounds not so fearful as burning imbecile that is their art to confound a plain man with dark words till his hissing flesh lets him know their meaning now listen to what i have seen when a soldier bleeds from a wound in battle these leeches say fever blood him and so they burn the wick at tother end too they bleed the bled now at fevers heels comes desperate weakness then the man needs all his blood to live but these prickers and burners having no forethought recking nought of what is sure to come in a few hours and seeing like brute beasts only what is under their noses having meantime robbed him of the very blood his hurt had spared him to battle that weakness withal and so he dies exhausted hundreds have i seen so scratched and pricked out of the world gerard and tall fellows too but lo if they have the luck to be wounded where no doctor can be had then they live this too have i seen had i ever outlived that field in brabant but for my most lucky mischance lack of chirurgery the frost chocked all my bleeding wounds and so i lived a chirurgeon had pricked yet one more hole in this my body with his lance and drained my last drop out and my spirit with it seeing them thus distraught in bleeding of the bleeding soldier i place no trust in them for what slays a veteran may well lay a milkandwater bourgeois low this sounds like common sense sighed gerard languidly but no need to raise your voice so i was not born deaf and just now i hear acutely common sense very common sense indeed shouted the bad listener why this is a soldier a brute whose business is to kill men not cure them he added in very tolerable french woe be to you unlearned man if you come between a physician and his patient and woe be to you misguided youth if you listen to that man of blood much obliged said denys with mock politeness but i am a true man and would rob no man of his name i do somewhat in the way of blood but not worth mention in this presence for one i slay you slay a score and for one spoonful of blood i draw you spill a tubful the world is still gulled by shows we soldiers vapour with long swords and even in war beget two foes for every one we kill but you smooth gownsmen with soft phrases and bare bodkins tis you that thin mankind a sick chamber is no place for jesting cried the physician no doctor nor for bawling said the patient peevishly come young man said the senior kindly be reasonable cuilibet in sua arte credendum est my whole life has been given to this art i studied at montpelier the first school in france and by consequence in europe there learned i dririmancy scatomancy pathology therapeusis and greater than them all anatomy for there we disciples of hippocrates and galen had opportunities those great ancients never knew goodbye quadrupeds and apes and paganism and mohammedanism we bought of the churchwardens we shook the gallows we undid the sextons work of dark nights penetrated with love of science and our kind all the authorities had their orders from paris to wink and they winked gods of olympus how they winked the gracious king assisted us he sent us twice a year a living criminal condemned to die and said deal ye with him as science asks dissect him alive if ye think fit by the liver of herod and neros bowels hell make me blush for the land that bore me an if he praises it any more shouted denys at the top of his voice gerard gave a little squawk and put his fingers in his ears but speedily drew them out and shouted angrily and as loudly you great roaring blaspheming bull of basan hold your noisy tongue denys summoned a contrite look tush slight man said the doctor with calm contempt and vibrated a hand over him as in this age men make a pointer dog down charge then flowed majestic on we seldom or never dissected the living criminal except in part we mostly inoculated them with such diseases as the barren time afforded selecting of course the more interesting ones that means the foulest whispered denys meekly these we watched through all their stages to maturity meaning the death of the poor rogue whispered denys meekly and now my poor sufferer who best merits your confidence this honest soldier with his youth his ignorance and his prejudices or a greybeard laden with the gathered wisdom of ages that is cried denys impatiently will you believe what a jackdaw in a long gown has heard from a starling in a long gown who heard it from a jaypie who heard it from a magpie who heard it from a popinjay or will you believe what i a man with nought to gain by looking awry nor speaking false have seen nor heard with the ears which are given us to gull us but seen with these sentinels mine eye seen seen to wit that fevered and blooded men die that fevered men not blooded live stay who sent for this sangsue did you not i i thought you had nay explained the doctor the good landlord told me one was down in his house so i said to myself a stranger and in need of my art and came incontinently it was the act of a good christian sir of a good bloodhound cried denys contemptuously what art thou so green as not to know that all these landlords are in league with certain of their fellowcitizens who pay them toll on each booty whatever you pay this ancient for stealing your life blood of that the landlord takes his third for betraying you to him nay more as soon as ever your blood goes down the stair in that basin there the landlord will see it or smell it and send swiftly to his undertaker and get his third out of that job for if he waited till the doctor got downstairs the doctor would be beforehand and bespeak his undertaker and then he would get the black thirds say i sooth old rouge et noir dites denys denys who taught you to think so ill of man mine eyes that are not to be gulled by what men say seeing this many a year what they do in all the lands i travel the doctor with some address made use of these last words to escape the personal question i too have eyes as well as thou and go not by tradition only but by what i have seen and not only seen but done i have healed as many men by bleeding as that interloping arabist has killed for want of it twas but tother day i healed one threatened with leprosy i but bled him at the tip of the nose i cured last year a quartan ague how bled its forefinger our cure lost his memory i brought it him back on the point of my lance i bled him behind the ear i bled a dolt of a boy and now he is the only one who can tell his right hand from his left in a whole family of idiots when the plague was here years ago no sham plague such as empyrics proclaim every six years or so but the good honest byzantine pest i blooded an alderman freely and cauterized the symptomatic buboes and so pulled him out of the grave whereas our then chirurgeon a most pernicious arabist caught it himself and died of it aha calling on rhazes avicenna and mahound who could they have come had all perished as miserably as himself oh my poor ears sighed gerard and am i fallen so low that one of your presence and speech rejects my art and listens to a rude soldier so far behind even his own miserable trade as to bear an arbalest a wornout invention that german children shoot at pigeons with but german soldiers mock at since ever arquebusses came and put them down you foulmouthed old charlatan cried denys the arbalest is shouldered by taller men than ever stood in rhenish hose and even now it kills as many more than your noisy stinking arquebus as the lancet does than all our toys together go to he was no fool who first called you leeches sangsues va gerard groaned by the holy virgin i wish you were both at jericho bellowing thank you comrade then ill bark no more but at need ill bite if he has a lance i have a sword if he bleeds you ill bleed him the moment his lance pricks your skin little one my swordhilt knocks against his ribs i have said it and denys turned pale folded his arms and looked gloomy and dangerous gerard sighed wearily now as all this is about me give me leave to say a word ay let the young man choose life or death for himself gerard then indirectly rebuked his noisy counsellors by contrast and example he spoke with unparalleled calmness sweetness and gentleness and these were the words of gerard the son of eli i doubt not you both mean me well but you assassinate me between you calmness and quiet are everything to me but you are like two dogs growling over a bone and in sooth bone i should be did this uproar last long there was a dead silence broken only by the silvery voice of gerard as he lay tranquil and gazed calmly at the ceiling and trickled into words first venerable sir i thank you for coming to see me whether from humanity or in the way of honest gain all trades must live your learning reverend sir seems great to me at least and for your experience your age voucheth it you say you have bled many and of these many many have not died thereafter but lived and done well i must needs believe you the physician bowed denys grunted others you say you have bled andthey are dead i must needs believe you denys knows few things compared with you but he knows them well he is a man not given to conjecture this i myself have noted he says he has seen the fevered and blooded for the most part die the fevered and not blooded live i must needs believe him here then all is doubt but thus much is certain if i be bled i must pay you a fee and be burnt and excruciated with a hot iron who am no felon pay a certain price in money and anguish for a doubtful remedy that will i never next to money and ease peace and quiet are certain goods above all in a sickroom but twould seem men cannot argue medicine without heat and raised voices therefore sir i will essay a little sleep and denys will go forth and gaze on the females of the place and i will keep you no longer from those who can afford to lay out blood and money in flebotomy and cautery the old physician had naturally a hot temper he had often during this battle of words mastered it with difficulty and now it mastered him the most dignified course was silence he saw this and drew himself up and made loftily for the door followed close by his little boy and big basket but at the door he choked he swelled he burst he whirled and came back openmouthed and the little boy and big basket had to whisk semicircularly not to be run down for de minimis non curat medicinaeven when not in a rage ah you reject my skill you scorn my art my revenge shall be to leave you to yourself lost idiot take your last look at me and at the sun your blood be on your head and away he stamped but on reaching the door he whirled and came back his wicker tail twirling round after him like a cats in twelve hours at furthest you will be in the secondary stage of fever your head will split your carotids will thump aha and let but a pin fall you will jump to the ceiling then send for me and ill not come he departed but at the doorhandle gathered fury wheeled and came flying with pale terrorstricken boy and wicker tail whisking after him next will comecramps of the stomach aha thenbilious vomit aha thencold sweat and deadly stupor thenconfusion of all the senses thenbloody vomit and after that nothing can save you not even i and if i could i would not and so farewell even denys changed colour at threats so fervent and precise but gerard only gnashed his teeth with rage at the noise and seized his hard bolster with kindling eye this added fuel to the fire and brought the insulted ancient back from the impassable door with his whisking train and after thatmadness and after thatblack vomit and thenconvulsions and thenthat cessation of all vital functions the vulgar call death for which thank your own satanic folly and insolence farewell he went he came he roared and think not to be buried in any christian churchyard for the bailiff is my good friend and i shall tell him how and why you died felo de se felo de se farewell gerard sprang to his feet on the bed by some supernatural gymnastic power excitement lent him and seeing him so moved the vindictive orator came back at him fiercer than ever to launch some masterthreat the world has unhappily lost for as he came with his whisking train and shaking his fist gerard hurled the bolster furiously in his face and knocked him down like a shot the boys head cracked under his falling masters and crash went the dumbstricken orator into the basket and there sat wedged in an inverted angle crushing phial after phial the boy being light was strewed afar but in a squatting posture so that they sat in a sequence like graduated specimens the smaller howling but soon the doctors face filled with horror and he uttered a far louder and unearthly screech and kicked and struggled with wonderful agility for one of his age he was sitting on the hot coals they had singed the cloth and were now biting the man struggling wildly but vainly to get out of the basket he rolled yelling over with it sideways and lo a great hissing then the humane gerard ran and wrenched off the tight basket not without a struggle the doctor lay on his face groaning handsomely singed with his own chafer and slaked a moment too late by his own villainous compounds which however being as various and even beautiful in colour as they were odious in taste had strangely diversified his grey robe and painted it more gaudy than neat gerard and denys raised him up and consoled him courage man tis but cautery balm of gilead why you recommend it but now to my comrade here the physician replied only by a look of concentrated spite and went out in dead silence thrusting his stomach forth before him in the drollest way the boy followed him next moment but in that slight interval he left off whining burst into a grin and conveyed to the culprits by an unrefined gesture his accurate comprehension of and rapturous though compressed joy at his masters disaster chapter xxvii the worthy physician went home and told his housekeeper he was in agony from a bad burn those were the words for in phlogistic as in other things we cauterize our neighbours digits but burn our own fingers his housekeeper applied some old womens remedy mild as milk he submitted like a lamb to her experience his sole object in the case of this patient being cure meantime he made out his bill for broken phials and took measures to have the travellers imprisoned at once he made oath before a magistrate that they being strangers and indebted to him meditated instant flight from the township alas it was his unlucky day his sincere desire and honest endeavour to perjure himself were baffled by a circumstance he had never foreseen nor indeed thought possible he had spoken the truth and in an affidavit the officers on reaching the silver lion found the birds were flown they went down to the river and from intelligence they received there started up the bank in hot pursuit this temporary escape the friends owed to denyss good sense and observation after a peal of laughter that it was a cordial to hear and after venting his watchword three times he turned short grave and told gerard dusseldorf was no place for them that old fellow said he went off unnaturally silent for such a babbler we are strangers here the bailiff is his friend in five minutes we shall lie in a dungeon for assaulting a dusseldorf dignity are you strong enough to hobble to the waters edge it is hard by once there you have but to lie down in a boat instead of a bed and what is the odds the odds denys untold and all in favour of the boat i pine for rome for rome is my road to sevenbergen and then we shall lie in the boat but on the rhine the famous rhine the cool refreshing rhine i feel its breezes coming the very sight will cure a little hopomythumb fever like mine away away finding his excitable friend in this mood denys settled hastily with the landlord and they hurried to the river on inquiry they found to their dismay that the public boat was gone this half hour and no other would start that day being afternoon by dint however of asking a great many questions and collecting a crowd they obtained an offer of a private boat from an old man and his two sons this was duly ridiculed by a bystander the current is too strong for three oars then my comrade and i will help row said the invalid no need said the old man bless your silly heart he owns tother boat there was a powerful breeze right astern the boatmen set a broad sail and rowing also went off at a spanking rate are ye better lad for the river breeze much better but indeed the doctor did me good the doctor why you would none of his cures no but i meanyou will say i am noughtbut knocking the old fool downsomehowit soothed me amiable dove how thy little character opens more and more every day like a rosebud i read thee all wrong at first nay denys mistake me not neither i trust i had borne with his idle threats though in sooth his voice went through my poor ears but he was an infidel or next door to one and such i have been taught to abhor did he not as good as say we owed our inward parts to men with long greek names and not to him whose name is but a syllable but whose hand is over all the earth pagan so you knocked him down forthwithlike a good christian now denys you will still be jesting take not an ill mans part had it been a thunderbolt from heaven he had met but his due yet he took but a sorry bolster from this weak arm what weak arm inquired denys with twinkling eyes i have lived among arms and by samsons hairy pow never saw i one more like a catapult the bolster wrapped round his nose and the two ends kissed behind his head and his forehead resounded and had he been goliath or julius caesar instead of an old quacksalver down he had gone st denys guard me from such feeble opposites as thou and above all from their weak armsthou diabolical young hypocrite the river took many turns and this sometimes brought the wind on their side instead of right astern then they all moved to the weather side to prevent the boat heeling over too much all but a child of about five years old the grandson of the boatman and his darling this urchin had slipped on board at the moment of starting and being too light to affect the boats trim was above or rather below the laws of navigation they sailed merrily on little conscious that they were pursued by a whole posse of constables armed with the bailiffs writ and that their pursuers were coming up with them for if the wind was strong so was the current and now gerard suddenly remembered that this was a very good way to rome but not to burgundy oh denys said he with an almost alarmed look this is not your road i know it said denys quietly but what can i do i cannot leave thee till the fever leaves thee and it is on thee still for thou art both red and white by turns i have watched thee i must een go on to cologne i doubt and then strike across thank heaven said gerard joyfully he added eagerly with a little touch of selfdeception twere a sin to be so near cologne and not see it oh man it is a vast and ancient city such as i have often dreamed of but neer had the good luck to see me miserable by what hard fortune do i come to it now well then denys continued the young man less warmly it is old enough to have been founded by a roman lady in the first century of grace and sacked by attila the barbarous and afterwards sore defaced by the norman lothaire and it has a church for every week in the year forbye chapels and churches innumerable of convents and nunneries and above all the stupendous minster yet unfinished and therein but in their own chapel lie the three kings that brought gifts to our lord melchior gold and gaspar frankincense and balthazar the black king he brought myrrh and over their bones stands the shrine the wonder of the world it is of evershining brass brighter than gold studded with images fairly wrought and inlaid with exquisite devices and brave with colours and two broad stripes run to and fro of jewels so great so rare each might adorn a crown or ransom its wearer at need and upon it stand the three kings curiously counterfeited two in solid silver richly gilt these be bareheaded but he of aethiop ebony and beareth a golden crown and in the midst our blessed lady in virgin silver with christ in her arms and at the corners in golden branches four goodly waxen tapers do burn night and day holy eyes have watched and renewed that light unceasingly for ages and holy eyes shall watch them in saecula i tell thee denys the oldest song the oldest flemish or german legend found them burning and they shall light the earth to its grave and there is st ursels church a british saints where lie her bones and all the other virgins her fellows eleven thousand were they who died for the faith being put to the sword by barbarous moors on the twentythird day of october two hundred and thirtyeight their bones are piled in the vaults and many of their skulls are in the church st ursels is in a thin golden case and stands on the high altar but shown to humble christians only on solemn days eleven thousand virgins cried denys what babies german men must have been in days of yore well would all their bones might turn flesh again and their skulls sweet faces as we pass through the gates tis odds but some of them are wearied of their estate by this time tush denys said gerard why wilt thou being good still make thyself seem evil if thy wishingcap be on pray that we may meet the meanest she of all those wise virgins in the next world and to that end let us reverence their holy dust in this one and then there is the church of the maccabees and the cauldron in which they and their mother solomona were boiled by a wicked king for refusing to eat swines flesh oh peremptory king and pigheaded maccabees i had eaten bacon with my pork liever than change places at the fire with my meat what scurvy words are these it was their faith nay bridle thy choler and tell me are there nought but churches in this thy so vaunted city for i affect rather sir knight than sir priest ay marry there is an university near a hundred years old and there is a marketplace no fairer in the world and at the four sides of it houses great as palaces and there is a stupendous senatehouse all covered with images and at the head of them stands one of stout herman gryn a soldier like thyself lad ay tell me of him what feat of arms earned him his niche a rare one he slew a lion in fair combat with nought but his cloak and a short sword he thrust the cloak in the brutes mouth and cut his spine in twain and there is the mans effigy and eke the lions to prove it the like was never done but by three more i ween samson was one and lysimachus of macedon another and benaiah a captain of davids host marry three tall fellows i would like well to sup with them all tonight so would not i said gerard drily but tell me said denys with some surprise when wast thou in cologne never but in the spirit i prattle with the good monks by the way and they tell me all the notable things both old and new ay ay have not i seen your nose under their very cowls but when i speak of matters that are out of sight my words they are small and the thing it was big now thy words be as big or bigger than the things art a good limner with thy tongue i have said it and for a saint as ready with hand or steel or bolsteras any poor sinner living and so shall i tell thee which of all these things thou hast described draws me to cologne ay denys thou and thou only no dead saint but my living friend and comrade true tis thou alone draws denys of burgundy to cologne gerard hung his head at this juncture one of the younger boatmen suddenly inquired what was amiss with little turnipface his young nephew thus described had just come aft grave as a judge and burst out crying in the midst without more ado on this phenomenon so sharply defined he was subjected to many interrogatories some coaxingly uttered some not had he hurt himself had he overate himself was he frightened was he cold was he sick was he an idiot to all and each he uttered the same reply which english writers render thus oh oh oh and french writers thus hi hi hi so fixed are fictions phonetics who can tell what ails the peevish brat snarled the young boatman impatiently rather look this way and tell me whom be these after the old man and his other son looked and saw four men walking along the east bank of the river at the sight they left rowing awhile and gathered mysteriously in the stern whispering and casting glances alternately at their passengers and the pedestrians the sequel may show they would have employed speculation better in trying to fathom the turnipface mystery i beg pardon of my age i mean the deep mind of dauntless infancy if tis as i doubt whispered one of the young men why not give them a squeak for their lives let us make for the west bank the old man objected stoutly what said he run our heads into trouble for strangers are ye mad nay let us rather cross to the east side still side with the strong arm that is my rede what say you werter i say please yourselves what age and youth could not decide upon a puff of wind settled most impartially came a squall and the little vessel heeled over the men jumped to windward to trim her but to their horror they saw in the very boat from stem to stern a ditch of water rushing to leeward and the next moment they saw nothing but felt the rhine the cold and rushing rhine turnipface had drawn the plug the officers unwound the cords from their waists gerard could swim like a duck but the best swimmer canted out of a boat capsized must sink ere he can swim the dark water bubbled loudly over his head and then he came up almost blind and deaf for a moment the next he saw the black boat bottom uppermost and figures clinging to it he shook his head like a waterdog and made for it by a sort of unthinking imitation but ere he reached it he heard a voice behind him cry not loud but with deep manly distress adieu comrade adieu he looked and there was poor denys sinking sinking weighed down by his wretched arbalest his face was pale and his eyes staring wide and turned despairingly on his dear friend gerard uttered a wild cry of love and terror and made for him cleaving the water madly but the next moment denys was under water the next gerard was after him the officers knotted a rope and threw the end in chapter xxviii things good and evil balance themselves in a remarkable manner and almost universally the steel bow attached to the arbalestriers back and carried above his head had sunk him that very steel bow owing to that very position could not escape gerards hands one of which grasped it and the other went between the bow and the cord which was as good the next moment denys by means of his crossbow was hoisted with so eager a jerk that half his body bobbed up out of water now grip me not grip me not cried gerard in mortal terror of that fatal mistake pas si bete gurgled denys seeing the sort of stuff he had to deal with gerard was hopeful and calm directly on thy back said he sharply and seizing the arbalest and taking a stroke forward he aided the desired movement hand on my shoulder slap the water with the other hand nowith a downward motion so do nothing more than i bid thee gerard had got hold of denyss long hair and twisting it hard caught the end between his side teeth and with the strong muscles of his youthful neck easily kept up the soldiers head and struck out lustily across the current a moment he had hesitated which side to make for little knowing the awful importance of that simple decision then seeing the west bank a trifle nearest he made towards it instead of swimming to jail like a good boy and so furnishing one a novel incident owing to the force of the current they slanted considerably and when they had covered near a hundred yards denys murmured uneasily how much more of it courage mumbled gerard whatever a duck knows a dutchman knows art safe as in bed the next moment to their surprise they found themselves in shallow water and so waded ashore once on terra firma they looked at one another from head to foot as if eyes could devour then by one impulse flung each an arm round the others neck and panted there with hearts too full to speak and at this sacred moment life was sweet as heaven to both sweetest perhaps to the poor exiled lover who had just saved his friend oh joy to whose height what poet has yet soared or ever tried to soar to save a human life and that life a loved one such moments are worth living for ay three score years and ten and then calmer they took hands and so walked along the bank hand in hand like a pair of sweethearts scarce knowing or caring whither they went the boat people were all safe on the late concave now convex craft herr turnipface the inverter of things being in the middle all this fracas seemed not to have essentially deranged his habits at least he was greeting when he shot our friends into the rhine and greeting when they got out again shall we wait till they right the boat no denys our fare is paid we owe them nought let us on and briskly denys assented observing that they could walk all the way to cologne on this bank i fare not to cologne was the calm reply why whither then to burgundy to burgundy ah no that is too good to be sooth sooth tis and sense into the bargain what matters it to me how i go to rome nay nay you but say so to pleasure me the change is too sudden and think me not so illhearted as take you at your word also did i not see your eyes sparkle at the wonders of cologne the churches the images the relics how dull art thou denys that was when we were to enjoy them together churches i shall see plenty go romeward how i will the bones of saints and martyrs alas the world is full of them but a friend like thee where on earths face shall i find another no i will not turn thee farther from the road that leads to thy dear home and her that pines for thee neither will i rob myself of thee by leaving thee since i drew thee out of rhine i love thee better than i did thou art my pearl i fished thee and must keep thee so gainsay me not or thou wilt bring back my fever but cry courage and lead on and hey for burgundy denys gave a joyful caper courage va pour la bourgogne oh soyes tranquille cette fois il est bien decidement mort ce coquinla and they turned their backs on the rhine on this decision making itself clear across the rhine there was a commotion in the little party that had been watching the discussion and the friends had not taken many steps ere a voice came to them over the water halt gerard turned and saw one of those four holding out a badge of office and a parchment slip his heart sank for he was a good citizen and used to obey the voice that now bade him turn again to dusseldorfthe laws denys did not share his scruples he was a frenchman and despised every other nation laws inmates and customs included he was a soldier and took a military view of the situation superior force opposed river between rear open why twas retreat made easy he saw at a glance that the boat still drifted in midstream and there was no ferry nearer than dusseldorf i shall beat a quick retreat to that hill said he and then being out of sight quick step they sauntered off halt in the bailiffs name cried a voice from the shore denys turned round and ostentatiously snapped his fingers at the bailiff and proceeded halt in the archbishops name denys snapped his fingers at his grace and proceeded halt in the emperors name denys snapped his fingers at his majesty and proceeded gerard saw this needless pantomime with regret and as soon as they had passed the brow of the hill said there is now but one course we must run to burgundy instead of walking and he set off and ran the best part of a league without stopping denys was fairly blown and inquired what on earth had become of gerards fever i begin to miss it sadly said he drily i dropped it in rhine i trow was the reply presently they came to a little village and here denys purchased a loaf and a huge bottle of rhenish wine for he said we must sleep in some hole or corner if we lie at an inn we shall be taken in our beds this was no more than common prudence on the old soldiers part the official network for catching lawbreakers especially plebeian ones was very close in that age though the cooperation of the public was almost null at all events upon the continent the innkeepers were everywhere under close surveillance as to their travellers for whose acts they were even in some degree responsible more so it would seem than for their sufferings the friends were both glad when the sun set and delighted when after a long trudge under the stars for the moon if i remember right did not rise till about three in the morning they came to a large barn belonging to a house at some distance a quantity of barley had been lately thrashed for the heap of straw on one side the thrashingfloor was almost as high as the unthrashed corn on the other here be two royal beds said denys which shall we lie on the mow or the straw the straw for me said gerard they sat on the heap and ate their brown bread and drank their wine and then denys covered his friend up in straw and heaped it high above him leaving him only a breathing hole water they say is death to fevered men ill make warm water ont anyhow gerard bade him make his mind easy these few drops from rhine cannot chill me i feel heat enough in my body now to parch a kennel or boil a cloud if i was in one and with this epigram his consciousness went so rapidly he might really be said to fall asleep denys who lay awake awhile heard that which made him nestle closer horses hoofs came ringing up from dusseldorf and the wooden barn vibrated as they rattled past howling in a manner too well known and understood in the th century but as unfamiliar in europe now as a red indians warwhoop denys shook where he lay gerard slept like a top it all swept by and troop and howls died away the stout soldier drew a long breath whistled in a whisper closed his eyes and slept like a top too in the morning he sat up and put out his hand to wake gerard it lighted on the young mans forehead and found it quite wet denys then in his quality of nurse forbore to wake him it is ill to check sleep or sweat in a sick man said he i know that far though i neer minced ape nor gallowsbird after waiting a good hour he felt desperately hungry so he turned and in selfdefence went to sleep again poor fellow in his hard life he had been often driven to this manoeuvre at high noon he was waked by gerard moving and found him sitting up with the straw smoking round him like a dunghill animal heat versus moisture gerard called him a lazy loon he quietly grinned they set out and the first thing denys did was to give gerard his arbalest etc and mount a high tree on the road coast clear to the next village said he and on they went on drawing near the village denys halted and suddenly inquired of gerard how he felt what can you not see i feel as if rome was no further than yon hamlet but thy body lad thy skin neither hot nor cold and yesterday twas hot one while and cold another but what i cannot get rid of is this tiresome leg le grand malheur many of my comrades have found no such difficulty ah there it goes again itches consumedly unhappy youth said denys solemnly the sum of thy troubles is this thy fever is gone and thy wound ishealing sith so it is added he indulgently i shall tell thee a little piece of news i had otherwise withheld what ist asked gerard sparkling with curiosity the hue and cry is out after us and on fleet horses oh chapter xxix gerard was staggered by this sudden communication and his colour came and went then he clenched his teeth with ire for men of any spirit at all are like the wild boar he will run from a superior force owing perhaps to his not being an ass but if you stick to his heels too long and too close and in short bore him he will whirl and come tearing at a multitude of hunters and perhaps bore you gerard then set his teeth and looked battle but the next moment his countenance fell and he said plaintively and my axe is in rhine they consulted together prudence bade them avoid that village hunger said buy food hunger spoke loudest prudence most convincingly they settled to strike across the fields they halted at a haystack and borrowed two bundles of hay and lay on them in a dry ditch out of sight but in nettles they sallied out in turn and came back with turnips these they munched at intervals in their retreat until sunset presently they crept out shivering into the rain and darkness and got into the road on the other side of the village it was a dismal night dark as pitch and blowing hard they could neither see nor hear nor be seen nor heard and for aught i know passed like ghosts close to their foes these they almost forgot in the natural horrors of the black tempestuous night in which they seemed to grope and hew their way as in black marble when the moon rose they were many a league from dusseldorf but they still trudged on presently they came to a huge building courage cried denys i think i know this convent aye it is we are in the see of juliers cologne has no power here the next moment they were safe within the walls chapter xxx here gerard made acquaintance with a monk who had constructed the great dial in the priors garden and a wheel for drawing water and a winnowing machine for the grain etc and had ever some ingenious mechanism on hand he had made several psalteries and two dulcimers and was now attempting a set of regalles or little organ for the choir now gerard played the humble psaltery a little but the monk touched that instrument divinely and showed him most agreeably what a novice he was in music he also illuminated finely but could not write so beautifully as gerard comparing their acquirements with the earnestness and simplicity of an age in which accomplishments implied a true natural bent youth and age soon became like brothers and gerard was pressed hard to stay that night he consulted denys who assented with a rueful shrug gerard told his old new friend whither he was going and described their late adventures softening down the bolster alack said the good old man i have been a great traveller in my day but none molested me he then told him to avoid inns they were always haunted by rogues and roysterers whence his soul might take harm even did his body escape and to manage each days journey so as to lie at some peaceful monastery then suddenly breaking off and looking as sharp as a needle at gerard he asked him how long since he had been shriven gerard coloured up and replied feebly better than a fortnight and thou an exorcist no wonder perils have overtaken thee come thou must be assoiled out of hand yes father said gerard and with all mine heart and was sinking down to his knees with his hands joined but the monk stopped him half fretfully not to me not to me not to me i am as full of the world as thou or any be that lives int my whole soul it is in these wooden pipes and sorry leathern stops which shall perishwith them whose minds are fixed on such like vanities dear father said gerard they are for the use of the church and surely that sanctifies the pains and labour spent on them that is just what the devil has been whispering in mine ear this while said the monk putting one hand behind his back and shaking his finger half threateningly half playfully at gerard he was even so kind and thoughtful as to mind me that solomon built the lord a house with rare hangings and that this in him was counted gracious and no sin oh he can quote scripture rarely but i am not so simple a monk as you think my lad cried the good father with sudden defiance addressing not gerard butvacancy this one toy finished vigils fasts and prayers for me prayers standing prayers lying on the chapel floor and prayers in a right good tub of cold water he nudged gerard and winked his eye knowingly nothing he hates and dreads like seeing us monks at our orisons up to our chins in cold water for corpus domat aqua so now go confess thy little trumpery sins pardonable in youth and secularity and leave me to mine sweet to me as honey and to be expiated in proportion gerard bowed his head but could not help saying where shall i find a confessor more holy and clement in each of these cells replied the monk simply they were now in the corridor there go to brother anselm yonder gerard followed the monks direction and made for a cell but the doors were pretty close to one another and it seems he mistook for just as he was about to tap he heard his old friend crying to him in an agitated whisper nay nay nay he turned and there was the monk at his celldoor in a strange state of anxiety going up and down and beating the air doublehanded like a bottom sawyer gerard really thought the cell he was at must be inhabited by some dangerous wild beast if not by that personage whose presence in the convent had been so distinctly proclaimed he looked back inquiringly and went on to the next door then his old friend nodded his head rapidly bursting in a moment into a comparatively blissful expression of face and shot back into his den he took his hourglass turned it and went to work on his regalles and often he looked up and said to himself welladay the sands how swift they run when the man is bent over earthly toys father anselm was a venerable monk with an ample head and a face all dignity and love therefore gerard in confessing to him and replying to his gentle though searching questions could not help thinking here is a headoh dear oh dear i wonder whether you will let me draw it when i have done confessing and so his own head got confused and he forgot a crime or two however he did not lower the bolstering this time nor was he so uncandid as to detract from the pagan character of the bolstered the penance inflicted was this he was to enter the convent church and prostrating himself kiss the lowest step of the altar three times then kneeling on the floor to say three paternosters and a credo this done come back to me on the instant accordingly his short mortification performed gerard returned and found father anselm spreading plaster after the soul the body said he know that i am the chirurgeon here for want of a better this is going on thy leg to cool it not to burn it the saints forbid during the operation the monastic leech who had naturally been interested by the dusseldorf branch of gerards confession rather sided with denys upon bleeding we dominicans seldom let blood nowadays the lay leeches say tis from timidity and want of skill but in sooth we have long found that simples will cure most of the ills that can be cured at all besides they never kill in capable hands and other remedies slay like thunderbolts as for the blood the vulgate saith expressly it is the life of a man and in medicine or law as in divinity to be wiser than the allwise is to be a fool moreover simples are mighty the little fourfooted creature that kills the poisonous snake if bitten herself finds an herb powerful enough to quell that poison though stronger and of swifter operation than any mortal malady and we taught by her wisdom and our own traditions still search and try the virtues of those plants the good god hath strewed this earth with some to feed mens bodies some to heal them only in desperate ills we mix heavenly with earthly virtue we steep the hair or the bones of some dead saint in the medicine and thus work marvellous cures think you father it is along of the reliques for peter a floris a learned leech and no pagan denies it stoutly what knows peter a floris and what know i i take not on me to say we can command the saints and will they nill they can draw corporal virtue from their blest remains but i see that the patient drinking thus in faith is often bettered as by a charm doubtless faith in the recipient is for much in all these cures but so twas ever a sick woman that all the jewish leeches failed to cure did but touch christs garment and was healed in a moment had she not touched that sacred piece of cloth she had never been healed had she without faith not touched it only but worn it to her grave i trow she had been none the better fort but we do ill to search these things too curiously all we see around us calls for faith have then a little patience we shall soon know all meantime i thy confessor for the nonce do strictly forbid thee on thy souls health to hearken learned lay folk on things religious arrogance is their bane with it they shut heavens open door in their own faces mind i say learned laics unlearned ones have often been my masters in humility and may be thine thy wound is cared for in three days twill be but a scar and now god speed thee and the saints make thee as good and as happy as thou art thoughtful and gracious gerard hoped there was no need to part yet for he was to dine in the refectory but father anselm told him with a shade of regret just perceptible and no more that he did not leave his cell this week being himself in penitence and with this he took gerards head delicately in both hands and kissed him on the brow and almost before the cell door had closed on him was back to his pious offices gerard went away chilled to the heart by the isolation of the monastic life and saddened too alas he thought here is a kind face i must never look to see again on earth a kind voice gone from mine ear and my heart for ever there is nothing but meeting and parting in this sorrowful world welladay welladay this pensive mood was interrupted by a young monk who came for him and took him to the refectory there he found several monks seated at a table and denys standing like a poker being examined as to the towns he should pass through the friars then clubbed their knowledge and marked out the route noting all the religious houses on or near that road and this they gave gerard then supper and after it the old monk carried gerard to his cell and they had an eager chat and the friar incidentally revealed the cause of his pantomime in the corridor ye had wellnigh fallen into brother jeromes clutches yon was his cell is father jerome an ill man then an ill man and the friar crossed himself a saint an anchorite the very pillar of this house he had sent ye barefoot to loretto nay i forgot yare bound for italy the spiteful old saint upon earth had sent ye to canterbury or compostella but jerome was born old and with a cowl anselm and i were boys once and wicked beyond anything you can imagine gerard wore a somewhat incredulous look this keeps us humble more or less and makes us reasonably lenient to youth and hot blood then at gerards earnest request one more heavenly strain upon the psalterion and so to bed the troubled spirit calmed and the sore heart soothed i have described in full this day marked only by contrast a day that came like oil on waves after so many passions and perilsbecause it must stand in this narrative as the representative of many such days which now succeeded to it for our travellers on their weary way experienced that which most of my readers will find in the longer journey of life viz that stirring events are not evenly distributed over the whole road but come by fits and starts and as it were in clusters to some extent this may be because they draw one another by links more or less subtle but there is more in it than that it happens so life is an intermittent fever now all narrators whether of history or fiction are compelled to slur these barren portions of time or else line trunks the practice however tends to give the unguarded reader a wrong arithmetical impression which there is a particular reason for avoiding in these pages as far as possible i invite therefore your intelligence to my aid and ask you to try and realize that although there were no more vivid adventures for a long while one days march succeeded another one monastery after another fed and lodged them gratis with a welcome always charitable sometimes genial and though they met no enemy but winter and rough weather antagonists not always contemptible yet they trudged over a much larger tract of territory than that their passage through which i have described so minutely and so the pair gerard bronzed in the face and travelstained from head to foot and denys with his shoes in tatters stiff and footsore both of them drew near the burgundian frontier chapter xxxi gerard was almost as eager for this promised land as denys for the latter constantly chanted its praises and at every little annoyance showed him they did things better in burgundy and above all played on his foible by guaranteeing clean bedclothes at the inns of that polished nation i ask no more the hollander would say to think that i have not lain once in a naked bed since i left home when i look at their linen instead of doffing habit and hose it is mine eyes and nose i would fain be shut of denys carried his love of country so far as to walk twenty leagues in shoes that had exploded rather than buy of a german churl who would throw all manner of obstacles in a customers way his incivility his dinner his body towards sunset they found themselves at equal distances from a little town and a monastery only the latter was off the road denys was for the inn gerard for the convent denys gave way but on condition that once in burgundy they should always stop at an inn gerard consented to this the more readily that his chart with its list of convents ended here so they turned off the road and now gerard asked with surprise whence this sudden aversion to places that had fed and lodged them gratis so often the soldier hemmed and hawed at first but at last his wrongs burst forth it came out that this was no sudden aversion but an ancient and abiding horror which he had suppressed till now but with infinite difficulty and out of politeness i saw they had put powder in your drink said he so i forbore them however being the last why not ease my mind know then i have been like a fish out of water in all those great dungeons you straightway levant with some old shaveling so you see not my purgatory forgive me i have been selfish ay ay i forgive thee little one tis not thy fault art not the first fool that has been priestrid and monkhit but ill not forgive them my misery then about a century before henry viiis commissioners he delivered his indictment these gloomy piles were all built alike inns differed but here all was monotony great gate little gate so many steps and then a gloomy cloister here the dortour there the great cold refectory where you must sit mumchance or at least inaudible he who liked to speak his mind out and then said he nobody is a man here but all are slaves and of what of a peevish tinkling bell that never sleeps an twere a trumpet now aye sounding alarums twouldnt freeze a mans heart so tinkle tinkle tinkle and you must sit to meat with may be no stomach for food ere your meat settles in your stomach tinkle tinkle and ye must to church with may be no stomach for devotion i am not a hog at prayers for one tinkle tinkle and now you must to bed with your eyes open well by then you have contrived to shut them some uneasy imp of darkness has got to the bellrope and tinkle tinkle it behoves you say a prayer in the dark whether you know one or not if they heard the sort of prayers i mutter when they break my rest with their tinkle well you drop off again and get about an eyeful of sleep lo it is tinkle tinkle for matins and the only clapper you love is a womans put in gerard half contemptuously because there is some music in that even when it scolds was the stout reply and then to be always checked if i do but put my finger in the saltcellar straightway i hear have you no knife that you finger the salt and if i but wipe my knife on the cloth to save time then tis wipe thy knife dirty on the bread and clean upon the cloth oh small of soul these little peevish pedantries fall chill upon good fellowship like wee icicles amelting down from strawen eaves i hold cleanliness no pedantry said gerard shouldst learn better manners once for all nay tis they who lack manners they stop a fellows mouth at every word at every other word you mean every obscene or blasphemous one exaggerator go to why at the very last of these dungeons i found the poor travellers sitting all chilled and mute round one shaveling like rogues awaiting their turn to be hanged so to cheer them up i did but cry out courage tout le monde le dia connu what befell marry this blaspheme not quo the bourreau plaitil say i doesnt he wheel and wyte on me in a sort of alsatian french turning all the ps into bs i had much ado not to laugh in his face being thyself unable to speak ten words of his language without a fault well all the world ought to speak french what avail so many jargons except to put a frontier atwixt mens hearts but what said he what signifies it what a fool says oh not all the words of a fool are folly or i should not listen to you well then he said such as begin by making free with the devils name aye end by doing it with all the names in heaven father said i i am a soldier and this is but my consigne or watchword oh then it is just a custom said he i not divining the old fox and thinking to clear myself said ay it was then that is ten times worse said he twill bring him about your ears one of these days he still comes where he hears his name often called observe no gratitude for the tidings which neither his missals nor his breviary had ever let him know then he was so good as to tell me soldiers do commonly the crimes for which all other men are broke on the wheel a savoir murder rape and pillage and ist not true true or not it was ill manners replied denys guardedly and so says this courteous host of mine being the foes of mankind why make enemies of good spirits into the bargain by still shouting the names of evil ones and a lot more stuff well but denys whether you hearken his rede or slight it wherefore blame a man for raising his voice to save your soul how can his voice save my soul when he keeps turning of his ps into bs gerard was staggered ere he could recover at this thunderbolt of gallicism denys went triumphant off at a tangent and stigmatized all monks as hypocrites do but look at them how they creep about and cannot eye you like honest men nay said gerard eagerly that modest downcast gaze is part of their discipline tis custodia oculorum cussed toads eating hoc hac horum no such thing just so looks a cutpurse cant meet a true mans eye doff cowl monk and behold a thief don cowl thief and lo a monk tell me not they will ever be able to look god almighty in the face when they cant even look a true man in the face down here ah here it is black as ink into the well we go comrade misericorde there goes the tinkle already tis the best of tinkles though tis for dinner stay listen i thought so the wolf in my stomach cried amen this last statement he confirmed with two oaths and marched like a victorious gamecock into the convent thinking by gerards silence he had convinced him and not dreaming how profoundly he had disgusted him chapter xxxii in the refectory allusion was made at the table where gerard sat to the sudden death of the monk who had undertaken to write out fresh copies of the charter of the monastery and the rule etc gerard caught this and timidly offered his services there was a hesitation which he mistook nay not for hire my lords but for love and as a trifling return for many a good nights lodging the brethren of your order have bestowed on me a poor wayfarer a monk smiled approvingly but hinted that the late brother was an excellent penman and his work could not be continued but by a master gerard on this drew from his wallet with some trepidation a vellum deed the back of which he had cleaned and written upon by way of specimen the monk gave quite a start at sight of it and very hastily went up the hall to the high table and bending his knee so as just to touch in passing the fifth step and the tenth or last presented it to the prior with comments instantly a dozen knowing eyes were fixed on it and a buzz of voices was heard and soon gerard saw the prior point more than once and the monk came back looking as proud as punch with a savoury crustade ryal or game pie gravied and spiced for gerard and a silver grace cup full of rich pimentum this latter gerard took and bowing low first to the distant prior then to his own company quaffed and circulated the cup instantly to his surprise the whole table hailed him as a brother art convent bred deny it not he acknowledged it and gave heaven thanks for it for otherwise he had been as rude and ignorant as his brothers sybrandt and cornelis but tis passing strange how you could know said he you drank with the cup in both hands said two monks speaking together the voices had for some time been loudish round a table at the bottom of the hall but presently came a burst of mirth so obstreperous and prolonged that the prior sent the very subprior all down the hall to check it and inflict penance on every monk at the table and gerards cheek burned with shame for in the heart of the unruly merriment his ear had caught the word courage and the trumpet tones of denys of burgundy soon gerard was installed in feu werters cell with wax lights and a little frame that could be set at any angle and all the materials of caligraphy the work however was too much for one evening then came the question how could he ask denys the monkhater to stay longer however he told him and offered to abide by his decision he was agreeably surprised when denys said graciously a days rest will do neither of us harm write thou and ill pass the time as i may gerards work was vastly admired they agreed that the records of the monastery had gained by poor werters death the subprior forced a rixdollar on gerard and several brushes and colours out of the convent stock which was very large he resumed his march warm at heart for this was of good omen since it was on the pen he relied to make his fortune and recover his wellbeloved come denys said he goodhumouredly see what the good monks have given me now do try to be fairer to them for to be round with you it chilled my friendship for a moment to hear even you call my benefactors hypocrites i recant said denys thank you thank you good denys i was a scurrilous vagabond nay nay say not so neither but we soldiers are rude and hasty i give myself the lie and i offer those i misunderstood all my esteem tis unjust that thousands should be defamed for the hypocrisy of a few now are you reasonable you have pondered what i said nay it is their own doing gerard crowed a little we all like to be proved in the right and was all attention when denys offered to relate how his conversion was effected well then at dinner the first day a young monk beside me did open his jaws and laughed right out and most musically good said i at last i have fallen on a man and not a shorn ape so to sound him further i slapped his broad back and administered my consigne heaven forbid says he i stared for the dog looked as sad as solomon a better mime saw you never even at a mystery i see war is no sharpener of the wits said he what are the clergy for but to fight the foul fiend and what else are the monks for the fiend being dead the friars are sped you may plough up the convents and we poor monks shall have nought to dobut turn soldiers and so bring him to life again then there was a great laugh at my expense well you are the monk for me said i and you are the crossbowman for me quo he and ill be bound you could tell us tales of the war should make our hair stand on end excusez the barber has put that out of the question quoth i and then i had the laugh what wretched ribaldry observed gerard pensively the candid denys at once admitted he had seen merrier jests hatched with less cackle twas a great matter to have got rid of hypocrisy so said i i can give you the chaire de poule if that may content ye that we will see was the cry and a signal went round denys then related bursting with glee how at bedtime he had been taken to a cell instead of the great dortour and strictly forbidden to sleep and to aid his vigil a book had been lent him of pictures representing a hundred merry adventures of monks in pursuit of the female laity and how in due course he had been taken out barefooted and down to the parlour where was a supper fit for the duke and at it twelve jolly friars the roaringest boys he had ever met in peace or war how the story the toast the jest the winecup had gone round and some had played cards with a gorgeous pack where saint theresa and saint catherine etc bedizened with gold stood for the four queens and black white grey and crutched friars for the four knaves and had staked their very rosaries swearing like troopers when they lost and how about midnight a sly monk had stolen out but had by him and others been as cannily followed into the garden and seen to thrust his hand into the ivy and out with a ropeladder with this he had run up on the wall which was ten feet broad yet not so nimbly but what a russet kirtle had popped up from the outer world as quick as he and so to billing and cooing that this situation had struck him as rather feline than ecclesiastical and drawn from him the appropriate comment of a mew the monks had joined the mewsical chorus and the lay visitor shrieked and been sore discomforted but abelard only cried what are ye there ye jealous miauling knaves ye shall caterwaul to some tune tomorrow night ill fit every manjack of ye with a fardingale that this brutal threat had reconciled him to stay another dayat gerards request gerard groaned meantime unable to disconcert so brazen a monk and the demoiselle beginning to whimper they had danced caterwauling in a circle then bestowed a solemn benediction on the two wallflowers and off to the parlour where they found a pair lying dead drunk and other two affectionate to tears that they had straightway carried off the inanimate and dragged off the loving and lachymose kicked them all merrily each into his cell and so shut up in measureless content gerard was disgusted and said so denys chuckled and proceeded to tell him how the next day he and the young monks had drawn the fishponds and secreted much pike carp tench and eel for their own use and how in the dead of night he had been taken shoeless by crooked ways into the chapel a ghostlike place being dark and then down some steps into a crypt below the chapel floor where suddenly paradise had burst on him tis there the holy fathers retire to pray put in gerard not always said denys wax candles by the dozen were lighted and princely cheer fifteen soups maigre with marvellous twangs of venison grouse and hare in them and twenty different fishes being friday cooked with wondrous art and each he between two buxom lasses and each lass between two lads with a cowl all but me and to think i had to woo by interpreter i doubt the knave put in three words for himself and one for me if he didnt hang him for a fool and some of the weaker vessels were novices and not wont to hold good wine had to be coaxed ere they would put it to their white teeth mais elles sy faisaient and the story and the jest and the cup went round bytheby they had flagons made to simulate breviaries and a monk touched the cittern and sang ditties with a voice tunable as a lark in spring the posies did turn the faces of the women folk bright red at first but elles sy faisaient here gerard exploded miserable wretches corrupters of youth perverters of innocence but for your being there denys who have been taught no better oh would god the church had fallen on the whole gang impious abominable hypocrites hypocrites cried denys with unfeigned surprise why that is what i clept them ere i knew them and you withstood me nay they are sinners all good fellows are that but by st denys his helmeted skull no hypocrites but right jolly roaring blades denys said gerard solemnly you little know the peril you ran that night that church you defiled amongst you is haunted i had it from one of the elder monks the dead walk there their light feet have been heard to patter oer the stones misericorde whispered denys ay more said gerard lowering his voice almost to a whisper celestial sounds have issued from the purlieus of that very crypt you turned into a tavern voices of the dead holding unearthly communion have chilled the ear of midnight and at times denys the faithful in their nightly watches have even heard music from dead lips and chords made by no mortal finger swept by no mortal hand have rung faintly like echoes deep among the dead in those sacred vaults denys wore a look of dismay ugh if i had known mules and wainropes had not hauled me thither and so with a sigh i had lost a merry time whether further discussion might have thrown any more light upon these ghostly sounds who can tell for up came a bearded brother from the monastery spurring his mule and waving a piece of vellum in his hand it was the deed between ghysbrecht and floris brandt gerard valued it deeply as a remembrance of home he turned pale at first but to think he had so nearly lost it and to denyss infinite amusement not only gave a piece of money to the lay brother but kissed the mules nose ill read you now said gerard were you twice as ill written andto make sure of never losing youhere he sat down and taking out needle and thread sewed it with feminine dexterity to his doublet and his mind and heart and soul were away to sevenbergen they reached the promised land and denys who was in high spirits doffed his bonnet to all the females who curtsied and smiled in return fired his consigne at most of the men at which some stared some grinned some both and finally landed his friend at one of the longpromised burgundian inns it is a little one said he but i know it of old for a good one les trois poissons but what is this writ up i mind not this and he pointed to an inscription that ran across the whole building in a single line of huge letters oh i see ici on loge a pied et a cheval said denys going minutely through the inscription and looking bumptious when he had effected it gerard did look and the sentence in question ran thus on ne loge ceans a credit ce bonhomme est mort les mauvais paieurs lont tue chapter xxxiii they met the landlord in the passage welcome messieurs said he taking off his cap with a low bow come we are not in germany said gerard in the public room they found the mistress a buxom woman of forty she curtsied to them and smiled right cordially give yourself the trouble of sitting ye down fair sir said she to gerard and dusted two chairs with her apron not that they needed it thank you dame said gerard well thought he this is a polite nation the trouble of sitting down that will i with singular patience and presently the labour of eating also the toil of digestion and finally by hercules his aid the strain of going to bed and the struggle of sinking fast asleep why denys what are you doing ordering supper for only two why not what can we sup without waiting for forty more burgundy forever aha courage camarade le dia cest convenu the salic law seemed not to have penetrated to french inns in this one at least wimple and kirtle reigned supreme doublets and hose were few in number and feeble in act the landlord himself wandered objectless eternally taking off his cap to folk for want of thought and the women as they passed him in turn thrust him quietly aside without looking at him as we remove a live twig in bustling through a wood a maid brought in supper and the mistress followed her empty handed fall to my masters said she cheerily yhave but one enemy here and he lies under your knife i shrewdly suspect this of formula they fell to the mistress drew her chair a little toward the table and provided company as well as meat gossiped genially with them like old acquaintances but this form gone through the busy dame was soon off and sent in her daughter a beautiful young woman of about twenty who took the vacant seat she was not quite so broad and genial as the elder but gentle and cheerful and showed a womanly tenderness for gerard on learning the distance the poor boy had come and had to go she stayed nearly halfanhour and when she left them gerard said this an inn why it is like home qui fit francois il fit courtois said denys bursting with gratified pride courteous nay christian to welcome us like home guests and old friends us vagrants here today and gone tomorrow but indeed who better merits pity and kindness than the worn traveller far from his folk hola heres another the newcomer was the chambermaid a woman of about twentyfive with a cocked nose a large laughing mouth and a sparkling black eye and a bare arm very stout but not very shapely the moment she came in one of the travellers passed a somewhat free jest on her the next the whole company were roaring at his expense so swiftly had her practised tongue done his business even as in a passage of arms between a novice and a master of fence foils clashnovice pinked on this another and then another must break a lance with her but marion stuck her great arms upon her haunches and held the whole room in play this country girl possessed in perfection that rude and ready humour which looks mean and vulgar on paper but carries all before it spoken not wits rapier its bludgeon nature had done much for her in this way and daily practice in an inn the rest yet shall she not be photographed by me but feebly indicated for it was just four hundred years ago the raillery was coarse she returned every stroke in kind and though a virtuous woman said things without winking which no decent man of our day would say even among men gerard sat gaping with astonishment this was to him almost a new variety of that interesting species homo he whispered denys now i see why you frenchmen say a womans tongue is her sword just then she levelled another assailant and the chivalrous denys to console and support the weaker vessel the iron kettle among the clay pots administered his consigne courage ma mie le etc she turned on him directly how can he be dead as long as there is an archer left alive general laughter at her allys expense it is washing day my masters said she with sudden gravity apres we travellers cannot strip and go bare while you wash our clothes objected a peevish old fellow by the fireside who had kept mumchance during the raillery but crept out into the sunshine of commonplaces i aimed not your way ancient man replied marion superciliously but since you ask me here she scanned him slowly from head to foot i trow you might take a turn in the tub clothes and all and no harm done laughter but what i spoke for i thought this young sire might like his beard starched poor gerards turn had come his chin crop was thin and silky the loudest of all the laughers this time was the traitor denys whose beard was of a good length and singularly stiff and bristly so that shakespeare though he never saw him hit him in the bulls eye full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard as you like it gerard bore the amazonian satire mighty calmly he had little personal vanity nay chambriere said he with a smile mine is all unworthy your pains take you this fair growth in hand and he pointed to denyss vegetable oh time for that when i starch the besoms whilst they were all shouting over this palpable hit the mistress returned and in no more time than it took her to cross the threshold did our amazon turn to a seeming madonna meek and mild mistresses are wonderful subjugators their like i think breathes not on the globe housemaids decide it was a waste of histrionic ability though for the landlady had heard and did not at heart disapprove the peals of laughter ah marion lass said she goodhumouredly if you laid me an egg every time you cackle les trois poissons would never lack an omelet now dame said gerard what is to pay what for our supper where is the hurry cannot you be content to pay when you go lose the guest find the money is the rule of the three fish but dame outside the three fish it is thus writtenicion ne loge bah let that flea stick on the wall look hither and she pointed to the smoky ceiling which was covered with hieroglyphics these were accounts vulgo scores intelligible to this dame and her daughter who wrote them at need by simply mounting a low stool and scratching with a knife so as to show lines of ceiling through the deposit of smoke the dame explained that the writing on the wall was put there to frighten moneyless folk from the inn altogether or to be acted on at odd times when a nonpaying face should come in and insist on being served we cant refuse them plump you know the law forbids us and how know you mine is not such a face out fie it is the best face that has entered the three fish this autumn and mine dame said denys dost see no knavery here she eyed him calmly not such a good one as the lads nor ever will be but it is the face of a true man for all that added she drily an i were ten years younger id as lieve not meet that face on a dark night too far from home gerard stared denys laughed why dame i would but sip the night dew off the flower and you neednt take ten years off nor ten days to be worth risking a scratched face for there our mistress said marion who had just come in said i not tother day you could make a fool of them still an if you were properly minded i dare say ye did it sounds like some daft wenchs speech dame said gerard this is wonderful what oh no no that is no wonder at all why i have been here all my life and reading faces is the first thing a girl picks up in an inn marion and frying eggs the second no telling lies frying eggs is the third though the mistress and holding her tongue the last and modesty the day after never at all marion alack talk of my tongue but i say no more she under whose wing i live now deals the blow im spedtis but a chambermaid gone catch whats left ont and she staggered and sank backwards on to the handsomest fellow in the room which happened to be gerard tic tic cried he peevishly there dont be stupid that is too heavy a jest for me see you not i am talking to the mistress marion resumed her elasticity with a grimace made two little bounds into the middle of the floor and there turned a pirouette there mistress said she i give in tis you that reigns supreme with the men leastways with male children young man said the mistress this girl is not so stupid as her deportment in reading of faces and frying of omelets there we are great twould be hard if we failed at these arts since they are about all we do know you do not quite take me dame said gerard that honesty in a face should shine forth to your experienced eye that seems reasonable but how by looking on denys here could you learn his one little foible his insanity his miserable mulierosity poor gerard got angrier the more he thought of it his mulehis what crossing herself with superstitious awe at the polysyllable nay tis but the word i was fain to invent for him invent what can a child like you make other words than grow in burgundy by nature take heed what ye do why we are overrun with them already especially bad ones lord these be times i look to hear of a new thistle invented next well then dame mulierosethat means wrapped up body and soul in women so prithee tell me how did you ever detect the noodles mulierosity alas good youth you make a mountain of a molehill we that are women be noticetakers and out of the tail of our eye see more than most men can glaring through a prospect glass whiles i move to and fro doing this and that my glance is still on my guests and i did notice that this soldiers eyes were never off the womenfolk my daughter or marion or even an old woman like me all was gold to him and there a sat glowering oh you foolish foolish man now you still turned to the speaker her or him and that is common sense denys burst into a hoarse laugh you never were more out why this silky smoothfaced companion is a very turkall but his beard he is what dye call em oser than ere an archer in the dukes bodyguard he is more wrapped up in one single dutch lass called margaret than i am in the whole bundle of ye brown and fair man alive that is just the contrary said the hostess yourn is the bane and hisn the cure cling you still to margaret my dear i hope she is an honest girl dame she is an angel ay ay they are all that till better acquainted id as lieve have her no more than honest and then she will serve to keep you out of worse company as for you soldier there is trouble in store for you your eyes were never made for the good of your soul nor of his pouch either said marion striking in and his lips they will sip the dew as he calls it off many a bramble bush overmuch clack marion overmuch clack ods bodikins mistress ye didnt hire me to be one o your three fishes did ye and marion sulked thirty seconds is that the way to speak to our mistress remonstrated the landlord who had slipped in hold your whisht said his wife sharply it is not your business to check the girl she is a good servant to you what is the cock never to crow and the hens at it all day you can crow as loud as you like my man out o doors but the hen means to rule the roost i know a byword to that tune said gerard do ye now out wit then femme veut en toute saison estre dame en sa mason i never heard it afore but tis as sooth as gospel ay they that set these bywords a rolling had eyes and tongues and tongues and eyes before all the world give me an old saw and me a young husband said marion now there was a chance for you all and nobody spoke oh it is too late now ive changed my mind all the better for some poor fellow suggested denys and now the arrival of the young mistress or as she was called the little mistress was the signal for them all to draw round the fire like one happy family travellers host hostess and even servants in the outer ring and tell stories till bedtime and gerard in his turn told a tremendous one out of his repertory a ms collection of acts of the saints and made them all shudder deliciously but soon after began to nod exhausted by the effort i should say the young mistress saw and gave marion a look she instantly lighted a rush and laying her hand on gerards shoulder invited him to follow her she showed him a room where were two nice white beds and bade him choose either is paradise said he ill take this one do you know i have not lain in a naked bed once since i left my home in holland alack poor soul said she well then the sooner my flax and your down he he come together the better soallons and she held out her cheek as businesslike as if it had been her hand for a fee allons what does that mean it means goodnight ahem what dont they salute the chambermaid in your part not all in a moment what do they make a business ont nay perverter of words i mean we make not so free with strange women they must be strange women if they do not think you strange fools then here is a coil why all the old greasy greybeards that lie at our inn do kiss us chambermaids faugh and what have we poor wretches to set on tother side the compt but now and then a nice young alack time flies chambermaids cant be spared long in the nursery so how ist to be ant please you arrange with my comrade for both he is mulierose i am not nay tis the curb he will want not the spur well well you shall to bed without paying the usual toll and oh but tis sweet to fall in with a young man who can withstand these ancient ill customs and gainsay brazen hussies shalt have thy reward thank you but what are you doing with my bed me oh only taking off these sheets and going to put on the pair the drunken miller slept in last night oh no no you cruel blackhearted thing there there a la bonne heure what will not perseverance effect but note now the frowardness of a mad wench i cared not fort a button i am dead sick of that sport this five years but you denied me so then forthwith i behoved to have it belike had gone through fire and water fort alas young sir we women are kittle cattle poor perverse toads excuse us and keep us in our place savoir at arms length and so goodnight at the door she turned and said with a complete change of tone and manner the virgin guard thy head and the holy evangelists watch the bed where lies a poor young wanderer far from home amen and the next moment he heard her run tearing down the stairs and soon a peal of laughter from the salle betrayed her whereabouts now that is a character said gerard profoundly and yawned over the discovery in a very few minutes he was in a dry bath of cold clean linen inexpressibly refreshing to him after so long disuse then came a delicious glow and thensevenbergen in the morning gerard awoke infinitely refreshed and was for rising but found himself a close prisoner his linen had vanished now this was paralysis for the nightgown is a recent institution in gerards century and indeed long after men did not play fast and loose with clean sheets when they could get them but crept into them clothed with their innocence like adam out of bed they seem to have taken most after his eldest son gerard bewailed his captivity to denys but that instant the door opened and in sailed marion with their linen newly washed and ironed on her two arms and set it down on the table oh you good girl cried gerard alack have you found me out at last yes indeed is this another custom nay not to take them unbidden but at night we aye question travellers are they for linen washed so i came into you but you were both sound then said i to the little mistress la where is the sense of waking wearied men task them is charles the great dead and would they liever carry foul linen or clean especially this one with a skin like cream and so he has i declare said the young mistress that was me remarked denys with the air of a commentator guess once more and youll hit the mark notice him not marion he is an impudent fellow and i am sure we cannot be grateful enough for your goodness and i am sorry i ever refused youanything you fancied you should like oh are ye there said lespiegle i take that to mean you would fain brush the morning dew off as your bashful companion calls it well then excuse me tis customary but not prudent i decline quits with you lad stop stop cried denys as she was making off victorious i am curious to know how many of ye were here last night afeasting your eyes on us twain twas so satisfactory a feast as we werent half a minute overt who why the big mistress the little mistress janet and me and the whole posse comitatus on tiptoe we mostly make our rounds the last thing not to get burned down and in prodigious numbers somehow that maketh us bolder especially where archers lie scattered about why did not you tell me id have lain awake beau sire the saying goes that the good and the ill are all one while their lids are closed so we said here is one who will serve god best asleep break not his rest she is funny said gerard dictatorially i must be either that or knavish how so because the three fish pay me to be funny you will eat before you part good then ill go see the meat be fit for such worshipful teeth denys what is your will i wish that was a great boy and going along with us to keep us cheery so do not i but i wish it was going along with us as it is now heaven forefend a fine fool you would make of yourself they broke their fast settled their score and said farewell then it was they found that marion had not exaggerated the custom of the country the three principal women took and kissed them right heartily and they kissed the three principal women the landlord took and kissed them and they kissed the landlord and the cry was come back the sooner the better never pass the three fish should your purses be void bring yourselves le sieur credit is not dead for you and they took the road again they came to a little town and denys went to buy shoes the shopkeeper was in the doorway but wide awake he received denys with a bow down to the ground the customer was soon fitted and followed to the street and dismissed with graceful salutes from the doorstep the friends agreed it was elysium to deal with such a shoemaker as this not but what my german shoes have lasted well enough said gerard the just outside the town was a pebbled walk this is to keep the burgherss feet dry awalking o sundays with their wives and daughters said denys those simple words of denys one stroke of a careless tongue painted home in gerards heart oh how sweet said he mercy what is this a gibbet and ugh two skeletons thereon oh denys what a sorry sight to woo by nay said denys a comfortable sight for every rogue i the air there is one the less afoot a little farther on they came to two pillars and between these was a huge wheel closely studded with iron prongs and entangled in these were bones and fragments of cloth miserably dispersed over the wheel gerard hid his face in his hands oh to think those patches and bones are all that is left of a man of one who was what we are now excusez a thing that went on two legs and stole are we no more than that how know ye he stole have true men never suffered death and torture too none of my kith ever found their way to the gibbet i know the better their luck prithee how died the saints hard but not in burgundy ye massacred them wholesale at lyons and that is on burgundys threshold to you the gibbet proves the crime because you read not story alas had you stood on calvary that bloody day we sigh for to this hour i tremble to think you had perhaps shouted for joy at the gibbet builded there for the cross was but the roman gallows father martin says the blaspheming old hound oh fie fie a holy and a booklearned man ay denys yhad read them that suffered there by the bare light of the gibbet drive in the nails yhad cried drive in the spear here be three malefactors three roues yet of those little three one was the first christian saint and another was the saviour of the world which gibbeted him denys assured him on his honour they managed things better in burgundy he added too after profound reflection that the horrors gerard had alluded to had more than once made him curse and swear with rage when told by the good cure in his native village at eastertide but they chanced in an outlandish nation and near a thousand years agone mort de ma vie let us hope it is not true or at least sore exaggerated do but see how all tales gather as they roll then he reflected again and all in a moment turned red with ire do ye not blush to play with your bookcraft on your unlettered friend and throw dust in his eyes evening the saints with these reptiles then suddenly he recovered his good humour since your heart beats for vermin feel for the carrion crows they be as good vermin as these would ye send them to bed supperless poor pretty poppets why these be their larder the pangs of hunger would gnaw them dead but for cold cutpurse hung up here and there gerard who had for some time maintained a dead silence informed him the subject was closed between them and for ever there are things said he in which our hearts seem wide as the poles asunder and eke our heads but i love thee dearly all the same he added with infinite grace and tenderness towards afternoon they heard a faint wailing noise on ahead it grew distincter as they proceeded being fast walkers they soon came up with its cause a score of pikemen accompanied by several constables were marching along and in advance of them was a herd of animals they were driving these creatures in number rather more than a hundred were of various ages only very few were downright old the males were downcast and silent it was the females from whom all the outcry came in other words the animals thus driven along at the laws point were men and women good heaven cried gerard what a band of them but stay surely all those children cannot be thieves why there are some in arms what on earth is this denys denys advised him to ask that bourgeois with the badge this is burgundy here a civil question ever draws a civil reply gerard went up to the officer and removing his cap a civility which was immediately returned said for our ladys sake sir what do ye with these poor folk nay what is that to you my lad replied the functionary suspiciously master im a stranger and athirst for knowledge that is another matter what are we doing ahem why wedost hear jacques here is a stranger seeks to know what we are doing and the two machines were tickled that there should be a man who did not know something they happened to know in all ages this has tickled however the chuckle was brief and moderated by the native courtesy and the official turned to gerard again what we are doing hum and now he hesitated not from any doubt as to what he was doing but because he was hunting for a single word that should convey the matter ce que nous faisons mon garsmaisdamnous transvasons you decant that should mean you pour from one vessel to another precisely he explained that last year the town of charmes had been sore thinned by a pestilence whole houses emptied and trades short of hands much ado to get in the rye and the flax half spoiled so the bailiff and aldermen had written to the dukes secretary and the duke he sent far and wide to know what town was too full that are we had the baillie of toul writ back then send four or five score of your townsfolk was the order was not this to decant the full town into the empty and is not the good duke the father of his people and will not let the duchy be weakened nor its fair towns laid waste by sword nor pestilence but meets the one with pike and arbalest touching his cap to the sergeant and denys alternately and tother with policy long live the duke the pikemen of course were not to be outdone in loyalty so they shouted with stentorian lungs long live the duke then the decanted ones partly because loyalty was a nonreasoning sentiment in those days partly perhaps because they feared some further ill consequence should they alone be mute raised a feeble tremulous shout long live the duke but at this insulted nature rebelled perhaps indeed the sham sentiment drew out the real for on the very heels of that royal noise a loud and piercing wail burst from every womans bosom and a deep deep groan from every mans oh the air filled in a moment with womanly and manly anguish judge what it must have been when the rude pikemen halted unbidden all confused as if a wall of sorrow had started up before them en avant roared the sergeant and they marched again but muttering and cursing ah the ugly sound said the civilian wincing les malheureux cried he ruefully for where is the single man can hear the sudden agony of a multitude and not be moved les ingrats they are going whence they were de trop to where they will be welcome from starvation to plentyand they object they even make dismal noises one would think we were thrusting them forth from burgundy come away whispered gerard trembling come away and the friends strode forward when they passed the head of the column and saw the men walk with their eyes bent in bitter gloom upon the ground and the women some carrying some leading little children and weeping as they went and the poor bairns some frolicking some weeping because their mammies wept gerard tried hard to say a word of comfort but choked and could utter nothing to the mourners but gasped come on denys i cannot mock such sorrow with little words of comfort and now artistlike all his aim was to get swiftly out of the grief he could not soothe he almost ran not to hear these sighs and sobs why mate said denys art the colour of a lemon man alive take not other folks troubles to heart not one of those whining milksops there but would see thee a stranger hanged without winking gerard scarce listened to him decant them he groaned ay if blood were no thicker than wine princes ye are wolves poor things poor things ah denys denys with looking on their grief mine own comes home to me welladay ah welladay ay now you talk reason that you poor lad should be driven all the way from holland to rome is pitiful indeed but these snivelling curs where is their hurt there is six score of em to keep one another company besides they are not going out of burgundy better for them if they had never been in it mechant va they are but going from one village to another a mules journey whilst thouthere no more courage camarade le diable est mort gerard shook his head very doubtfully but kept silence for about a mile and then he said thoughtfully ay denys but then i am sustained by booklearning these are simple folk that likely thought their village was the world now what is this more weeping oh tis a sweet world humph a little girl that hath broke her pipkin now may i hang on one of your gibbets but ill dry somebodys tears and he pounced savagely upon this little martyr like a kite on a chick but with more generous intentions it was a pretty little lass of about twelve the tears were raining down her two peaches and her palms lifted to heaven in that utter though temporary desolation which attends calamity at twelve and at her feet the fatal cause a broken pot worth say the fifth of a modern farthing what hast broken thy pot little one said gerard acting intensest sympathy helas bel gars as you behold and the hands came down from the sky and both pointed at the fragments a statuette of adversity and you weep so for that needs i must bel gars my mammy will massacre me do they not already with a fresh burst of woe cccall me jjjeanneton cccasse tout it wanted but this that i should break my poor pot helas fallaitil donc mere de dieu courage little love said gerard tis not thy heart lies broken money will soon mend pots see now here is a piece of silver and there scarce a stones throw off is a potter take the bit of silver to him and buy another pot and the copper the potter will give thee keep that to play with thy comrades the little mind took in all this and smiles began to struggle with the tears but spasms are like waves they cannot go down the very moment the wind of trouble is lulled so denys thought well to bring up his reserve of consolation courage ma mie le diable est mort cried that inventive warrior gaily gerard shrugged his shoulders at such a way of cheering a little girl what a fine thing is a lute with one string said he the little girls face broke into warm sunshine oh the good news oh the good news she sang out with such heartfelt joy it went off into a honeyed whine even as our gay old tunes have a pathos underneath so then said she they will no longer be able to threaten us little girls with him making our lives a burden and she bounded off to tell nanette she said there is a theory that everything has its counterpart if true denys it would seem had found the mind his consigne fitted while he was roaring with laughter at its unexpected success and gerards amazement a little hand pulled his jerkin and a little face peeped round his waist curiosity was now the dominant passion in that small but vivid countenance estce toi qui la tue beau soldat oui ma mie said denys as gruffly as ever he could rightly deeming this would smack of supernatural puissance to owners of belllike trebles cest moi ca vaut une petite embrassadepas je crois ben aie aie quastu ca pique ca pique quel dommage je vais la couper nein ce nest rien et pisque tas tue ce mechant tes fierement beau tout d meme toi tes lien miex que ma grande soeur will you not kiss me too ma mie said gerard je ne demande par miex tiens tiens tiens cest doulce celleci ah que jaimons les hommes des fames ca ne maurait jamais donne larjan blanc plutot ca maurait ri au nez cest si peu de chose les fames serviteur beaulx sires bon voiage et noubliez point la jeanneton adieu petit coeur said gerard and on they marched but presently looking back they saw the contemner of women in the middle of the road making them a reverence and blowing them kisses with little may morning face come on cried gerard lustily i shall win to rome yet holy st bavon what a sunbeam of innocence hath shot across our bloodthirsty road forget thee little jeanneton not likely amidst all this slobbering and gibbeting and decanting come on thou laggard forward dost call this marching remonstrated denys why we shall walk oer christmas day and never see it at the next town they came to suddenly an arbalestrier ran out of a tavern after them and in a moment his beard and denyss were like two brushes stuck together it was a comrade he insisted on their coming into the tavern with him and breaking a bottle of wine in course of conversation he told denys there was an insurrection in the dukes flemish provinces and soldiers were ordered thither from all parts of burgundy indeed i marvelled to see thy face turned this way i go to embrace my folk that i have not seen these three years ye can quell a bit of a rising without me i trow suddenly denys gave a start dost hear gerard this comrade is bound for holland what then ah a letter a letter to margaret but will he be so good so kind the soldier with a torrent of blasphemy informed him he would not only take it but go a league or two out of his way to do it in an instant out came inkhorn and paper from gerards wallet and he wrote a long letter to margaret and told her briefly what i fear i have spun too tediously dwelt most on the bear and the plunge in the rhine and the character of denys whom he painted to the life and with many endearing expressions bade her to be of good cheer some trouble and peril there had been but all that was over now and his only grief left was that he could not hope to have a word from her hand till he should reach rome he ended with comforting her again as hard as he could and so absorbed was he in his love and his work that he did not see all the people in the room were standing peeping to watch the nimble and true finger execute such rare penmanship denys proud of his friends skill let him alone till presently the writers face worked and soon the scalding tears began to run down his young cheeks one after another on the paper where he was then writing comfort comfort then denys rudely repulsed the curious and asked his comrade with a faltering voice whether he had the heart to let so sweet a loveletter miscarry the other swore by the face of st luke he would lose the forefinger of his right hand sooner seeing him so ready gerard charged him also with a short cold letter to his parents and in it he drew hastily with his pen two hands grasping each other to signify farewell bytheby one drop of bitterness found its way into his letter to margaret but of that anon gerard now offered money to the soldier he hesitated but declined it no no art comrade of my comrade and may etc but thy love for the wench touches me ill break another bottle at thy charge an thou wilt and so cry quits well said comrade cried denys hadst taken money i had invited thee to walk in the courtyard and cross swords with me whereupon i had cut thy comb for thee retorted the other hadst done thy endeavour drole i doubt not they drank the new bottle shook hands adhered to custom and parted on opposite routes this delay however somewhat put out denyss calculations and evening surprised them ere they reached a little town he was making for where was a famous hotel however they fell in with a roadside auberge and denys seeing a buxom girl at the door said this seems a decent inn and led the way into the kitchen they ordered supper to which no objection was raised only the landlord requested them to pay for it beforehand it was not an uncommon proposal in any part of the world still it was not universal and denys was nettled and dashed his hand somewhat ostentatiously into his purse and pulled out a gold angel count me the change and speedily said he you tavernkeepers are more likely to rob me than i you while the supper was preparing denys disappeared and was eventually found by gerard in the yard helping manon his plump but not bright decoy duck to draw water and pouring extravagant compliments into her dullish ear gerard grunted and returned to table but denys did not come in for a good quarter of an hour uphill work at the end of a march said he shrugging his shoulders what matters that to you said gerard drily the mad dog bites all the world exaggerator you know i bite but the fairer half well here comes supper that is better worth biting during supper the girl kept constantly coming in and out and looking pointblank at them especially at denys and at last in leaning over him to remove a dish dropped a word in his ear and he replied with a nod as soon as supper was cleared away denys rose and strolled to the door telling gerard the sullen fair had relented and given him a little rendezvous in the stableyard gerard suggested that the calfpen would have been a more appropriate locality i shall go to bed then said he a little crossly where is the landlord out at this time of night no matter i know our room shall you be long pray not i i grudge leaving the fire and thee but what can i do there are two sorts of invitations a burgundian never declines denys found a figure seated by the well it was manon but instead of receiving him as he thought he had a right to expect coming by invitation all she did was to sob he asked her what ailed her she sobbed could he do anything for her she sobbed the goodnatured denys driven to his wits end which was no great distance proffered the custom of the country by way of consolation she repulsed him roughly is it a time for fooling said she and sobbed you seem to think so said denys waxing wroth but the next moment he added tenderly and i who could never bear to see beauty in distress it is not for myself who then your sweetheart oh que nenni my sweetheart is not on earth now and to think i have not an ecu to buy masses for his soul and in this shallow nature the grief seemed now to be all turned in another direction come come said denys shalt have money to buy masses for thy dead lad i swear it meantime tell me why you weep for you for me art mad no i am not mad tis you that were mad to open your purse before him the mystery seemed to thicken and denys wearied of stirring up the mud by questions held his peace to see if it would not clear of itself then the girl finding herself no longer questioned seemed to go through some internal combat at last she said doggedly and aloud i will the virgin give me courage what matters it if they kill me since he is dead soldier the landlord is out oh is he what do landlords leave their taverns at this time of night also see what a tempest we are sheltered here but tother side it blows a hurricane denys said nothing he is gone to fetch the band the band what band those who will cut your throat and take your gold wretched man to go and shake gold in an innkeepers face the blow came so unexpectedly it staggered even denys accustomed as he was to sudden perils he muttered a single word but in it a volume gerard gerard what is that oh tis thy comrades name poor lad get him out quick ere they come and fly to the next town and thou they will kill me that shall they not fly with us twill avail me nought one of the band will be sent to kill me they are sworn to slay all who betray them ill take thee to my native place full thirty leagues from hence and put thee under my own mothers wing ere they shall hurt a hair o thy head but first gerard stay thou here whilst i fetch him as he was darting off the girl seized him convulsively and with all the iron strength excitement lends to women stay me not for pitys sake he cried tis life or death shsh whispered the girl shutting his mouth hard with her hand and putting her pale lips close to him and her eyes that seemed to turn backwards straining towards some indistinct sound he listened he heard footsteps many footsteps and no voices she whispered in his ear they are come and trembled like a leaf denys felt it was so travellers in that number would never have come in dead silence the feet were now at the very door how many said he in a hollow whisper hush and she put her mouth to his very ear and who that had seen this man and woman in that attitude would have guessed what freezing hearts were theirs and what terrible whispers passed between them how armed sword and dagger and the giant with his axe they call him the abbot and my comrade nothing can save him better lose one life than two fly denyss blood froze at this cynical advice poor creature you know not a soldiers heart he put his head in his hands a moment and a hundred thoughts of dangers baffled whirled through his brain listen girl there is one chance for our lives if thou wilt but be true to us run to the town to the nearest tavern and tell the first soldier there that a soldier here is sore beset but armed and his life to be saved if they will but run then to the bailiff but first to the soldiers nay not a word but buss me good lass and fly mens lives hang on thy heels she kilted up her gown to run he came round to the road with her saw her cross the road cringing with fear then glide away then turn into an erect shadow then melt away in the storm and now he must get to gerard but how he had to run the gauntlet of the whole band he asked himself what was the worst thing they could do for he had learned in war that an enemy does not what you hope he will do but what you hope he will not do attack me as i enter the kitchen then i must not give them time just as he drew near to the latch a terrible thought crossed him suppose they had already dealt with gerard why then thought he nought is left but to kill and be killed and he strung his bow and walked rapidly into the kitchen there were seven hideous faces seated round the fire and the landlord pouring them out neat brandy bloods forerunner in every age what company cried denys gaily one minute my lads and ill be with you and he snatched up a lighted candle off the table opened the door that led to the staircase and went up it hallooing what gerard whither hast thou skulked to there was no answer he hallooed louder gerard where art thou after a moment in which denys lived an hour of agony a peevish halfinarticulate noise issued from the room at the head of the little stairs denys burst in and there was gerard asleep thank god he said in a choking voice then began to sing loud untuneful ditties gerard put his fingers into his ears but presently he saw in denyss face a horror that contrasted strangely with this sudden merriment what ails thee said he sitting up and staring hush said denys and his hand spoke even more plainly than his lips listen to me denys then pointing significantly to the door to show gerard sharp ears were listening hard by continued his song aloud but under cover of it threw in short muttered syllables our lives are in peril thieves thy doublet thy sword aid coming put off time then aloud well now wilt have tother bottlesay nay no not i but i tell thee there are halfadozen jolly fellows tired ay but i am too wearied said gerard go thou nay nay then he went to the door and called out cheerfully landlord the young milksop will not rise give those honest fellows tother bottle i will pay fort in the morning he heard a brutal and fierce chuckle having thus by observation made sure the kitchen door was shut and the miscreants were not actually listening he examined the chamber door closely then quietly shut it but did not bolt it and went and inspected the window it was too small to get out of and yet a thick bar of iron had been let in the stone to make it smaller and just as he made this chilling discovery the outer door of the house was bolted with a loud clang denys groaned the beasts are in the shambles but would the thieves attack them while they were awake probably not not to throw away this their best chance the poor souls now made a series of desperate efforts to converse as if discussing ordinary matters and by this means gerard learned all that had passed and that the girl was gone for aid pray heaven she may not lose heart by the way said denys sorrowfully and denys begged gerards forgiveness for bringing him out of his way for this gerard forgave him i would fear them less gerard but for one they call the abbot i picked him out at once taller than you bigger than us both put together fights with an axe gerard a man to lead a herd of deer to battle i shall kill that man tonight or he will kill me i think somehow tis he will kill me saints forbid shoot him at the door what avails his strength against your weapon i shall pick him out but if it comes to hand fighting run swiftly under his guard or you are a dead man i tell thee neither of us may stand a blow of that axe thou never sawest such a body of a man gerard was for bolting the door but denys with a sign showed him that half the doorpost turned outward on a hinge and the great bolt was little more than a blind i have forborne to bolt it said he that they may think us the less suspicious near an hour rolled away thus it seemed an age yet it was but a little hour and the town was a league distant and some of the voices in the kitchen became angry and impatient they will not wait much longer said denys and we have no chance at all unless we surprise them i will do whateer you bid said gerard meekly there was a cupboard on the same side as the door but between it and the window it reached nearly to the ground but not quite denys opened the cupboard door and placed gerard on a chair behind it if they run for the bed strike at the napes of their necks a sword cut there always kills or disables he then arranged the bolsters and their shoes in the bed so as to deceive a person peeping from a distance and drew the short curtains at the head meantime gerard was on his knees denys looked round and saw him ah said denys above all pray them to forgive me for bringing you into this guetapens and now they grasped hands and looked in one anothers eyes oh such a look denyss hand was cold and gerards warm they took their posts denys blew out the candle we must keep silence now but in the terrible tension of their nerves and very souls they found they could hear a whisper fainter than any man could catch at all outside that door they could hear each others hearts thump at times good news breathed denys listening at the door they are casting lots pray that it may be the abbot yes why if he comes alone i can make sure of him denys ay i fear i shall go mad if they do not come soon shall i feign sleep shall i snore will that perhaps do then and god have mercy on us denys snored at intervals there was a scuffling of feet heard in the kitchen and then all was still denys snored again then took up his position behind the door but he or they who had drawn the lot seemed determined to run no foolish risks nothing was attempted in a hurry when they were almost starved with cold and waiting for the attack the door on the stairs opened softly and closed again nothing more there was another harrowing silence then a single light footstep on the stair and nothing more then a light crept under the door and nothing more presently there was a gentle scratching not half so loud as a mouses and the false doorpost opened by degrees and left a perpendicular space through which the light streamed in the door had it been bolted would now have hung by the bare tip of the bolt which went into the real doorpost but as it was it swung gently open of itself it opened inwards so denys did not raise his crossbow from the ground but merely grasped his dagger the candle was held up and shaded from behind by a mans hand he was inspecting the beds from the threshold satisfied that his victims were both in bed the man glided into the apartment but at the first step something in the position of the cupboard and chair made him uneasy he ventured no further but put the candle on the floor and stooped to peer under the chair but as he stooped an iron hand grasped his shoulder and a dagger was driven so fiercely through his neck that the point came out at his gullet there was a terrible hiccough but no cry and halfadozen silent strokes followed in swift succession each a deathblow and the assassin was laid noiselessly on the floor denys closed the door bolted it gently drew the post to and even while he was going whispered gerard to bring a chair it was done help me set him up dead parbleu what for frighten them gain time even while saying this denys had whipped a piece of string round the dead mans neck and tied him to the chair and there the ghastly figure sat fronting the door denys i can do better saints forgive me what be quick then we have not many moments and denys got his crossbow ready and tearing off his straw mattress reared it before him and prepared to shoot the moment the door should open for he had no hope any more would come singly when they found the first did not return while thus employed gerard was busy about the seated corpse and to his amazement denys saw a luminous glow spreading rapidly over the white face gerard blew out the candle and on this the corpses face shone still more like a glowworms head denys shook in his shoes and his teeth chattered what in heavens name is this he whispered hush tis but phosphorus but twill serve away they will surprise thee in fact uneasy mutterings were heard below and at last a deep voice said what makes him so long is the drole rifling them it was their comrade they suspected then not the enemy soon a step came softly but rapidly up the stairs the door was gently tried when this resisted which was clearly not expected the sham post was very cautiously moved and an eye no doubt peeped through the aperture for there was a howl of dismay and the man was heard to stumble back and burst into the kitchen here a babel of voices rose directly on his return gerard ran to the dead thief and began to work on him again back madman whispered denys nay nay i know these ignorant brutes they will not venture here awhile i can make him ten times more fearful at least close that opening let them not see you at your devilish work gerard closed the sham post and in half a minute his brush gave the dead head a sight to strike any man with dismay he put his art to a strange use and one unparalleled perhaps in the history of mankind he illuminated his dead enemys face to frighten his living foe the staring eyeballs he made globes of fire the teeth he left white for so they were more terrible by the contrast but the palate and tongue he tipped with fire and made one lurid cavern of the red depths the chapfallen jaw revealed and on the brow he wrote in burning letters la mort and while he was doing it the stout denys was quaking and fearing the vengeance of heaven for one mans courage is not anothers and the band of miscreants below were quarrelling and disputing loudly and now without disguise the steps that led down to the kitchen were fifteen but they were nearly perpendicular there was therefore in point of fact no distance between the besiegers and besieged and the latter now caught almost every word at last one was heard to cry out i tell ye the devil has got him and branded him with hellfire i am more like to leave this cursed house than go again into a room that is full of fiends art drunk or mad or a coward said another call me a coward ill give thee my daggers point and send thee where pierre sits o fire for ever come no quarrelling when work is afoot roared a tremendous diapason or ill brain ye both with my fist and send ye where we shall all go soon or late the abbot whispered denys gravely he felt the voice he had just heard could belong to no man but the colossus he had seen in passing through the kitchen it made the place vibrate the quarrelling continued some time and then there was a dead silence look out gerard ay what will they do next we shall soon know shall i wait for you or cut down the first that opens the door wait for me lest we strike the same and waste a blow alas we cannot afford that dead silence sudden came into the room a thing that made them start and their hearts quiver and what was it a moonbeam even so can this machine the body by the souls action be strung up to start and quiver the sudden ray shot keen and pure into that shamble its calm cold silvery soul traversed the apartment in a stream of no great volume for the window was narrow after the first tremor gerard whispered courage denys gods eye is on us even here and he fell upon his knees with his face turned towards the window ay it was like a holy eye opening suddenly on human crime and human passions many a scene of blood and crime that pure cold eye had rested on but on few more ghastly than this where two men with a lighted corpse between them waited panting to kill and be killed nor did the moonlight deaden that horrible corpselight if anything it added to its ghastliness for the body sat at the edge of the moonbeam which cut sharp across the shoulder and the ear and seemed blue and ghastly and unnatural by the side of that lurid glow in which the face and eyes and teeth shone horribly but denys dared not look that way the moon drew a broad stripe of light across the door and on that his eyes were glued presently he whispered gerard gerard looked and raised his sword acutely as they had listened they had heard of late no sound on the stair yet therein the doorpost at the edge of the stream of moonlight were the tips of the fingers of a hand the nails glistened presently they began to crawl and crawl down towards the bolt but with infinite slowness and caution in so doing they crept into the moonlight the actual motion was imperceptible but slowly slowly the fingers came out whiter and whiter but the hand between the main knuckles and the wrist remained dark denys slowly raised his crossbow he levelled it he took a long steady aim gerard palpitated at last the crossbow twanged the hand was instantly nailed with a stern jar to the quivering doorpost there was a scream of anguish cut whispered denys eagerly and gerards uplifted sword descended and severed the wrist with two swift blows a body sank down moaning outside the hand remained inside immovable with blood trickling from it down the wall the fierce bolt slightly barbed had gone through it and deep into the real doorpost two said denys with terrible cynicism he strung his crossbow and kneeled behind his cover again the next will be the abbot the wounded man moved and presently crawled down to his companions on the stairs and the kitchen door was shut there nothing was heard now but low muttering the last incident had revealed the mortal character of the weapons used by the besieged i begin to think the abbots stomach is not so great as his body said denys the words were scarcely out of his mouth when the following events happened all in a couple of seconds the kitchen door was opened roughly a heavy but active man darted up the stairs without any manner of disguise and a single ponderous blow sent the door not only off its hinges but right across the room on to denyss fortification which it struck so rudely as nearly to lay him flat and in the doorway stood a colossus with a glittering axe he saw the dead man with the moons blue light on half his face and the red light on the other half and inside his chapfallen jaws he stared his arms fell his knees knocked together and he crouched with terror la mort he cried in tones of terror and turned and fled in which act denys started up and shot him through both jaws he sprang with one bound into the kitchen and there leaned on his axe spitting blood and teeth and curses denys strung his bow and put his hand into his breast he drew it out dismayed my last bolt is gone he groaned but we have our swords and you have slain the giant no gerard said denys gravely i have not and the worst is i have wounded him fool to shoot at a retreating lion he had never faced thy handiwork again but for my meddling ha to your guard i hear them open the door then denys depressed by the one error he had committed in all this fearful night felt convinced his last hour had come he drew his sword but like one doomed but what is this a red light flickers on the ceiling gerard flew to the window and looked out there were men with torches and breastplates gleaming red we are saved armed men and he dashed his sword through the window shouting quick quick we are sore pressed back yelled denys they come strike none but him that very moment the abbot and two men with naked weapons rushed into the room even as they came the outer door was hammered fiercely and the abbots comrades hearing it and seeing the torchlight turned and fled not so the terrible abbot wild with rage and pain he spurned his dead comrade chair and all across the room then as the men faced him on each side with kindling eyeballs he waved his tremendous axe like a feather right and left and cleared a space then lifted it to hew them both in pieces his antagonists were inferior in strength but not in swiftness and daring and above all they had settled how to attack him the moment he reared his axe they flew at him like cats and both together if he struck a full blow with his weapon he would most likely kill one but the other would certainly kill him he saw this and intelligent as well as powerful he thrust the handle fiercely in denyss face and turning jobbed with the steel at gerard denys went staggering back covered with blood gerard had rushed in like lightning and just as the axe turned to descend on him drove his sword so fiercely through the giants body that the very hilt sounded on his ribs like the blow of a pugilist and denys staggering back to help his friend saw a steel point come out of the abbot behind the stricken giant bellowed like a bull dropped his axe and clutching gerards throat tremendously shook him like a child then denys with a fierce snarl drove his sword into the giants back stand firm now and he pushed the cold steel through and through the giant and out at his breast thus horribly spitted on both sides the abbot gave a violent shudder and his heels hammered the ground convulsively his lips fast turning blue opened wide and deep and he cried la mortla mortla mort the first time in a roar of despair and then twice in a horrorstricken whisper never to be forgotten just then the street door was forced suddenly the abbots arms whirled like windmills and his huge body wrenched wildly and carried them to the doorway twisting their wrists and nearly throwing them off their legs hell win clear yet cried denys out steel and in again they tore out their smoking swords but ere they could stab again the abbot leaped full five feet high and fell with a tremendous crash against the door below carrying it away with him like a sheet of paper and through the aperture the glare of torches burst on the awestruck faces above half blinding them the thieves at the first alarm had made for the back door but driven thence by a strong guard ran back to the kitchen just in time to see the lock forced out of the socket and halfadozen mailed archers burst in upon them on these in pure despair they drew their swords but ere a blow was struck on either side the staircase door behind them was battered into their midst with one ponderous blow and with it the abbots body came flying hurled as they thought by no mortal hand and rolled on the floor spouting blood from back and bosom in two furious jets and quivered but breathed no more the thieves smitten with dismay fell on their knees directly and the archers bound them while above the rescued ones still stood like statues rooted to the spot their dripping swords extended in the red torchlight expecting their indomitable enemy to leap back on them as wonderfully as he had gone chapter xxxiv where be the true men here be we god bless you all god bless you there was a rush to the stairs and halfadozen hard but friendly hands were held out and grasped them warmly yhave saved our lives lads cried denys yhave saved our lives this night a wild sight met the eyes of the rescued pair the room flaring with torches the glittering breastplates of the archers their bronzed faces the white cheeks of the bound thieves and the bleeding giant whose dead body these hard men left lying there in its own gore gerard went round the archers and took them each by the hand with glistening eyes and on this they all kissed him and this time he kissed them in return then he said to one handsome archer of his own age prithee good soldier have an eye to me a strange drowsiness overcomes me let no one cut my throat while i sleepfor pitys sake the archer promised with a laugh for he thought gerard was jesting and the latter went off into a deep sleep almost immediately denys was surprised at this but did not interfere for it suited his immediate purpose a couple of archers were inspecting the abbots body turning it half over with their feet and inquiring which of the two had flung this enormous rogue down from an upper storey like that they would fain have the trick of his arm denys at first pished and pshawed but dared not play the braggart for he said to himself that young vagabond will break in and say twas the finger of heaven and no mortal arm or some such stuff and make me look like a fool but now seeing gerard unconscious he suddenly gave this required information well then you see comrades i had run my sword through this one up to the hilt and one or two more of em came buzzing about me so it behoved me have my sword or die so i just put my foot against his stomach gave a tug with my hand and a spring with my foot and sent him flying to kingdom come he died in the air and his carrion rolled in amongst you without ceremony made you jump i warrant me but pikestaves and pillage what avails prattling of these trifles once they are gone by buvons camarades buvons the archers remarked that it was easy to say buvons where no liquor was but not so easy to do it nay ill soon find you liquor my nose hath a natural alacrity at scenting out the wine you follow me and i my nose bring a torch and they left the room and finding a short flight of stone steps descended them and entered a large low damp cellar it smelt close and dank and the walls were encrusted here and there with what seemed cobwebs but proved to be saltpetre that had oozed out of the damp stones and crystallized oh the fine mouldy smell said denys in such places still lurks the good wine advance thy torch diable what is that in the corner a pile of rags no tis a man they gathered round with the torch and lo a figure crouched on a heap in the corner pale as ashes and shivering why it is the landlord said denys get up thou craven heart shouted one of the archers why man the thieves are bound and we are dry that bound them up and show us thy wine for no bottles see here what be the rascals bound stammered the pale landlord good news wwwine that will i honest sirs and he rose with unsure joints and offered to lead the way to the wine cellar but denys interposed you are all in the dark comrades he is in league with the thieves alack good soldier me in league with the accursed robbers is that reasonable the girl said so anyway the girl what girl ah curse her traitress well interposed the other archer the girl is not here but gone on to the bailiff so let the burghers settle whether this craven be guilty or no for we caught him not in the act and let him draw us our wine one moment said denys shrewdly why cursed he the girl if he be a true man he should bless her as we do alas sir said the landlord i have but my good name to live by and i cursed her to you because you said she had belied me humph i trow thou art a thief and where is the thief that cannot lie with a smooth face therefore hold him comrades a prisoner can draw wine an if his hands be not bound the landlord offered no objection but on the contrary said he would with pleasure show them where his little stock of wine was but hoped they would pay for what they should drink for his rent was due this two months the archers smiled grimly at his simplicity as they thought it one of them laid a hand quietly but firmly on his shoulder the other led on with the torch they had reached the threshold when denys cried halt what ist here be bottles in this corner advance thy light the torchbearer went towards him he had just taken off his scabbard and was probing the heap the landlord had just been crouched upon nay nay cried the landlord the wine is in the next cellar there is nothing there nothing is mighty hard then said denys and drew out something with his hand from the heap it proved to be only a bone denys threw it on the floor it rattled there is nought there but the bones of the house said the landlord just now twas nothing now that we have found something tis nothing but bones heres another humph look at this one comrade and you come too and look at it and bring you smooth knave along the archer with the torch whose name was philippe held the bone to the light and turned it round and round well said denys well if this was a field of battle i should say twas the shankbone of a man no more no less but tisnt a battlefield nor a churchyard tis an inn true mate but yon knaves ashy face is as good a light to me as a field of battle i read the bone by it bring yon face nearer i say when the chine is amissing and the house dog cant look at you without his tail creeping between his legs who was the thief good brothers mine my mind it doth misgive me the deeper i thrust the more there be mayhap if these bones could tell their tale they would make true mens flesh creep that heard it alas young man what hideous fancies are these the bones are bones of beeves and sheep and kids and not as you think of men and women holy saints preserve us hold thy peace thy words are air thou hast not got burghers by the ear that know not a veal knuckle from their grandsires ribs but soldiersmen that have gone to look for their dear comrades and found their bones picked as clean by the crows as these i doubt have been by thee and thy mates men and women saidst thou and prithee when spake i a word of womens bones wouldst make a child suspect thee field of battle comrade was not this house a field of battle half an hour agone drag him close to me let me read his face now then what is this thou knave and he thrust a small object suddenly in his face alas i know not well i would not swear neither but it is too like the thumb bone of a mans hand mates my flesh it creeps churchyard how know i this is not one and he now drew his sword out of the scabbard and began to rake the heap of earth and broken crockery and bones out on the floor the landlord assured him he but wasted his time we poor innkeepers are sinners said he we give short measure and baptize the wine we are fain to do these things the laws are so unjust to us but we are not assassins how could we afford to kill our customers may heavens lightning strike me dead if there be any bones there but such as have been used for meat tis the kitchen wench flings them here i swear by gods holy mother by holy paul by holy dominic and denys my patron saintah denys held out a bone under his eye in dead silence it was a bone no man however ignorant however lying could confound with those of sheep or oxen the sight of it shut the lying lips and palsied the heartless heart the landlords hair rose visibly on his head like spikes and his knees gave way as if his limbs had been struck from under him but the archers dragged him fiercely up and kept him erect under the torch staring fascinated at the dead skull which white as the living cheek opposed but no whiter glared back again at its murderer whose pale lip now opened and opened but could utter no sound ah said denys solemnly and trembling now with rage look on the sockets out of which thou hast picked the eyes and let them blast thine eyes that crows shall pick out ere this week shall end now hold thou that while i search on hold it i say or here i rob the gallows and he threatened the quaking wretch with his naked sword till with a groan he took the skull and held it almost fainting oh that every murderer and contriver of murder could see him sick and staggering with terror and with his hair on end holding the cold skull and feeling that his own head would soon be like it and soon the heap was scattered and alas not one nor two but many skulls were brought to light the culprit moaning at each discovery suddenly denys uttered a strange cry of distress to come from so bold and hard a man and held up to the torch a mass of human hair it was long glossy and golden a womans beautiful hair at the sight of it the archers instinctively shook the craven wretch in their hands and he whined i have a little sister with hair just so fair and shining as this gulped denys jesu if it should be hers there quick take my sword and dagger and keep them from my hand lest i strike him dead and wrong the gibbet and thou poor innocent victim on whose head this most lovely hair did grow hear me swear this on bended knee never to leave this man till i see him broken to pieces on the wheel even for thy sake he rose from his knee ay had he as many lives as here be hairs id have them all by god and he put the hair into his bosom then in a sudden fury seized the landlord fiercely by the neck and forced him to his knees and foot on head ground his face savagely among the bones of his victims where they lay thickest and the assassin first yelled then whined and whimpered just as a dog first yells then whines when his nose is so forced into some leveret or other innocent he has killed now lend me thy bowstring philippe he passed it through the eyes of a skull alternately and hung the ghastly relic of mortality and crime round the mans neck then pulled him up and kicked him industriously into the kitchen where one of the aldermen of the burgh had arrived with constables and was even now taking an archers deposition the grave burgher was much startled at sight of the landlord driven in bleeding from a dozen scratches inflicted by the bones of his own victims and carrying his horrible collar but denys came panting after and in a few fiery words soon made all clear bind him like the rest said the alderman sternly i count him the blackest of them all while his hands were being bound the poor wretch begged piteously that the skull might be taken from him humph said the alderman certes i had not ordered such a thing to be put on mortal man yet being there i will not lift voice nor finger to doff it methinks it fits thee truly thou bloody dog tis thy ensign and hangs well above a heart so foul as thine he then inquired of denys if he thought they had secured the whole gang or but a part your worship said denys there are but seven of them and this landlord one we slew upstairs one we trundled down dead the rest are bound before you good go fetch the dead one from upstairs and lay him beside him i caused to be removed here a voice like a guineafowls broke peevishly in now now now where is the hand that is what i want to see the speaker was a little pettifogging clerk you will find it above nailed to the doorpost by a crossbow bolt good said the clerk he whispered his master what a goodly show will the pieces de conviction make and with this he wrote them down enumerating them in separate squeaks as he penned them skullsbonesa womans haira thiefs hands axe carcasses crossbow bolt this done he itched to search the cellar himself there might be other invaluable morsels of evidence an ear or even an earring the alderman assenting he caught up a torch and was hurrying thither when an accident stopped him and indeed carried him a step or two in the opposite direction the constables had gone up the stair in single file but the head constable no sooner saw the phosphorescent corpse seated by the bedside than he stood stupefied and next he began to shake like one in an ague and terror gaining on him more and more he uttered a sort of howl and recoiled swiftly forgetting the steps in his recoil he tumbled over backward on his nearest companion but he shaken by the shout of dismay and catching a glimpse of something horrid was already staggering back and in no condition to sustain the head constable who like most head constables was a ponderous man the two carried away the third and the three the fourth and they streamed into the kitchen and settled on the floor overlapping each other like a sequence laid out on a cardtable the clerk coming hastily with his torch ran an involuntary tilt against the fourth man who sharing the momentum of the mass knocked him instantly on his back the ace of that fair quint and there he lay kicking and waving his torch apparently in triumph but really in convulsion sense and wind being driven out together by the concussion what is to do now in heavens name cried the alderman starting up with considerable alarm but denys explained and offered to accompany his worship so be it said the latter his men picked themselves ruefully up and the alderman put himself at their head and examined the premises above and below as for the prisoners their interrogatory was postponed till they could be confronted with the servant before dawn the thieves alive and dead and all the relics and evidences of crime and retribution were swept away into the laws net and the inn was silent and almost deserted there remained but one constable and denys and gerard the latter still sleeping heavily chapter xxxv gerard awoke and found denys watching him with some anxiety it is you for sleeping why tis high noon it was a blessed sleep said gerard methinks heaven sent it me it hath put as it were a veil between me and that awful night to think that you and i sit here alive and well how terrible a dream i seem to have had ay lad that is the wise way to look at these things when once they are past why they are dreams shadows break thy fast and then thou wilt think no more ont moreover i promised to bring thee on to the town by noon and take thee to his worship gerard then sopped some rye bread in red wine and ate it to break his fast then went with denys over the scene of combat and came back shuddering and finally took the road with his friend and kept peering through the hedges and expecting sudden attacks unreasonably till they reached the little town denys took him to the white hart no fear of cutthroats here said he i know the landlord this many a year he is a burgess and looks to be bailiff tis here i was making for yestreen but we lost time and night oertook usand and you saw a woman at the door and would be wiser than a jeanneton she told us they were nought why what saved our lives if not a woman ay and risked her own to do it that is true denys and though women are nothing to me i long to thank this poor girl and reward her ay though i share every doit in my purse with her do not you parbleu where shall we find her mayhap the alderman will tell us we must go to him first the alderman received them with a most singular and inexplicable expression of countenance however after a moments reflection he wore a grim smile and finally proceeded to put interrogatories to gerard and took down the answers this done he told them that they must stay in the town till the thieves were tried and be at hand to give evidence on peril of fine and imprisonment they looked very blank at this however said he twill not be long the culprits having been taken redhanded he added and you know in any case you could not leave the place this week denys stared at this remark and gerard smiled at what he thought the simplicity of the old gentleman in dreaming that a provincial town of burgundy had attraction to detain him from rome and margaret he now went to that which was nearest both their hearts your worship said he we cannot find our benefactress in the town nay but who is your benefactress who why the good girl that came to you by night and saved our lives at peril of her own oh sir our hearts burn within us to thank and bless her where is she chapter xxxvi in prison sir good lack for what misdeed well she is a witness and may be a necessary one why messire bailiff put in denys you lay not all your witnesses by the heels i trow the alderman pleased at being called bailiff became communicative in a case of blood we detain all testimony that is like to give us leg bail and so defeat justice and that is why we still keep the women folk for a man at odd times hides a week in one mind but a woman if she do her duty to the realm o friday she shall undo it afore sunday or try could you see yon wench now you should find her ablubbering at having betrayed five males to the gallows had they been females we might have trusted to a subpoena for they despise one another and there they show some sense but now i think ont there were other reasons for laying this one by the heels hand me those depositions young sir and he put on his glasses ay she was implicated she was one of the band a loud disclaimer burst from denys and gerard at once no need to deave me said the alderman here tis in black and white jean hardy that is one of the thieves being questioned confessed thathumph ay here tis and that the girl manon was the decoy and her sweetheart was georges vipont one of the band and hanged last month and that she had been deject ever since and had openly blamed the band for his death saying if they had not been rank cowards he had never been taken and it is his opinion she did but betray them out of very spite and his opinion cried gerard indignantly what signifies the opinion of a cutthroat burning to be revenged on her who has delivered him to justice and an you go to that what avails his testimony is a thief never a liar is he not aye a liar and here a motive to lie revenge why tis the strongest of all the passions and oh sir what madness to question a detected felon and listen to him lying away an honest lifeas if he were a true man swearing in open day with his true hand on the gospel laid young man said the alderman restrain thy heat in presence of authority i find by your tone you are a stranger know then that in this land we question all the world we are not so weak as to hope to get at the truth by shutting either our left ear or our right and so you would listen to satan belying the saints ta ta the law meddles but with men and women and these cannot utter a story all lies let them try ever so wherefore we shut not the barndoor as the saying is against any mans grain only having taken it in we do winnow and sift it and who told you i had swallowed the thiefs story whole like fair water not so i did but credit so much ont as was borne out by better proof better proof and gerard looked blank why who but the thieves would breathe a word against her marry herself herself sir what did you question her too i tell you we question all the world here is her deposition can you readread it yourself then gerard looked at denys and read him manons deposition i am a native of epinal i left my native place two years ago because i was unfortunate i could not like the man they bade me so my father beat me i ran away from my father i went to service i left service because the mistress was jealous of me the reason that she gave for turning me off was because i was saucy last year i stood in the marketplace to be hired with other girls the landlord of the fair star hired me i was eleven months with him a young man courted me i loved him i found out that travellers came and never went away again i told my lover he bade me hold my peace he threatened me i found my lover was one of a band of thieves when travellers were to be robbed the landlord went out and told the band to come then i wept and prayed for the travellers souls i never told a month ago my lover died the soldier put me in mind of my lover he was bearded like him i had lost i cannot tell whether i should have interfered if he had had no beard i am sorry i told now the paper almost dropped from gerards hands now for the first time he saw that manons life was in mortal danger he knew the dogged law and the dogged men that executed it he threw himself suddenly on his knees at the aldermans feet oh sir think of the difference between those cruel men and this poor weak woman could you have the heart to send her to the same death with them could you have the heart to condemn us to look on and see her slaughtered who but that she risked her life for ours had not now been in jeopardy alas sir show me and my comrade some pity if you have none for her poor soul denys and i be true men and you will rend our hearts if you kill that poor simple girl what can we do what is left for us to do then but cut our throats at her gallows foot the alderman was tough but mortal the prayers and agitation of gerard first astounded then touched him he showed it in a curious way he became peevish and fretful there get up do said he i doubt whether anybody would say as many words for me what ho daniel go fetch the town clerk and on that functionary entering from an adjoining room here is a foolish lad fretting about yon girl can we stretch a point say we admit her to bear witness and question her favourably the town clerk was one of your impossibility men nay sir we cannot do that she was not concerned in this business had she been accessory we might have offered her a pardon to bear witness gerard burst in but she did better instead of being accessory she stayed the crime and she proffered herself as witness by running hither with the tale tush young man tis a matter of law the alderman and the clerk then had a long discussion the one maintaining the other denying that she stood as fair in law as if she had been accessory to the attempt on our travellers lives and this was lucky for manon for the alderman irritated by the clerk reiterating that he could not do this and could not that and could not do tother said he would show him he could do anything he chose and he had manon out and upon the landlord of the white hart being her bondsman and denys depositing five gold pieces with him and the girl promising not without some coaxing from denys to attend as a witness he liberated her but eased his conscience by telling her in his own terms his reason for this leniency the town had to buy a new rope for everybody hanged and present it to the bourreau or compound with him in money and she was not in his opinion worth this municipal expense whereas decided characters like her late confederates were and so denys and gerard carried her off gerard dancing round her for joy denys keeping up her heart by assuring her of the demise of a troublesome personage and she weeping inauspiciously however on the road to the white hart the public found her out and having heard the whole story from the archers who naturally told it warmly in her favour followed her hurrahing and encouraging her till finding herself backed by numbers she plucked up heart the landlord too saw at a glance that her presence in the inn would draw custom and received her politely and assigned her an upper chamber here she buried herself and being alone rained tears again poor little mind it was like a ripple up and down down and up up and down bidding the landlord be very kind to her and keep her a prisoner without letting her feel it the friends went out and lo as they stepped into the street they saw two processions coming towards them from opposite sides one was a large one attended with noise and howls and those indescribable cries by which rude natures reveal at odd times that relationship to the beasts of the field and forest which at other times we succeed in hiding the other very thinly attended by a few nuns and friars came slow and silent the prisoners going to exposure in the marketplace the gathered bones of the victims coming to the churchyard and the two met in the narrow street nearly at the inn door and could not pass each other for a long time and the bier that bore the relics of mortality got wedged against the cart that carried the men who had made those bones what they were and in a few hours must die for it themselves the mob had not the quick intelligence to be at once struck with this stern meeting but at last a woman cried look at your work ye dogs and the crowd took it like wildfire and there was a horrible yell and the culprits groaned and tried to hide their heads upon their bosoms but could not their hands being tied and there they stood images of pale holloweyed despair and oh how they looked on the bier and envied those whom they had sent before them on the dark road they were going upon themselves and the two men who were the cause of both processions stood and looked gravely on and even manon hearing the disturbance crept to the window and hiding her face peeped trembling through her fingers as women will this strange meeting parted denys and gerard the former yielded to curiosity and revenge the latter doffed his bonnet and piously followed the poor remains of those whose fate had so nearly been his own for some time he was the one lay mourner but when they had reached the suburbs a long way from the greater attraction that was filling the marketplace more than one artisan threw down his tools and more than one shopman left his shop and touched with pity or a sense of our common humanity and perhaps decided somewhat by the example of gerard followed the bones bareheaded and saw them deposited with the prayers of the church in hallowed ground after the funeral rites gerard stepped respectfully up to the cure and offered to buy a mass for their souls gerard son of catherine always looked at two sides of a penny and he tried to purchase this mass a trifle under the usual terms on account of the pitiable circumstances but the good cure gently but adroitly parried his ingenuity and blandly screwed him up to the market price in the course of the business they discovered a similarity of sentiments piety and worldly prudence are not very rare companions still it is unusual to carry both so far as these two men did their collision in the prayer market led to mutual esteem as when knight encountered knight worthy of his steel moreover the good cure loved a bit of gossip and finding his customer was one of those who had fought the thieves at domfront would have him into his parlour and hear the whole from his own lips and his heart warmed to gerard and he said god was good to thee i thank him fort with all my soul thou art a good lad he added drily shouldst have told me this tale in the churchyard i doubt i had given thee the mass for love however said he the thermometer suddenly falling tis ill luck to go back upon a bargain but ill broach a bottle of my old medoc for thee and few be the guests i would do that for the cure went to his cupboard and while he groped for the choice bottle he muttered to himself at their old tricks again plaitil said gerard i said nought ay here tis nay your reverence you surely spoke you said at their old tricks again said i so in sooth and his reverence smiled he then proceeded to broach the wine and filled a cup for each then he put a log of wood on the fire for stoves were none in burgundy and so i said at their old tricks did i come sip the good wine and whilst it lasts story for story i care not if i tell you a little tale gerards eyes sparkled thou lovest a story as my life nay but raise not thine expectations too high neither tis but a foolish trifle compared with thine adventures the cures tale once upon a time then in the kingdom of france and in the duchy of burgundy and not a days journey from the town where now we sit asipping of old medoc there lived a cure i say he lived but barely the parish was small the parishioners greedy and never gave their cure a doit more than he could compel the nearer they brought him to a disembodied spirit by meagre diet the holier should be his prayers in their behalf i know not if this was their creed but their practice gave it colour at last he pickled a rod for them one day the richest farmer in the place had twins to baptize the cure was had to the christening dinner as usual but ere he would baptize the children he demanded not the christening fees only but the burial fees saints defend us parson cried the mother talk not of burying i did never see children liker to live nor i said the cure the praise be to god natheless they are sure to die being sons of adam as well as of thee dame but die when they will twill cost them nothing the burial fees being paid and entered in this book for all that twill cost them something quoth the miller the greatest wag in the place and as big a knave as any for which was the biggest god knoweth but no mortal man not even the hangman miller i tell thee nay quo the cure parson i tell you ay quo the miller twill cost them their lives at which millstone conceit was a great laugh and in the general mirth the fees were paid and the christians made but when the next parishioners child and the next after and all had to pay each his burial fee or lose his place in heaven discontent did secretly rankle in the parish well one fine day they met in secret and sent a churchwarden with a complaint to the bishop and a thunderbolt fell on the poor cure came to him at dinnertime a summons to the episcopal palace to bring the parish books and answer certain charges then the cure guessed where the shoe pinched he left his food on the board for small his appetite now and took the parish books and went quaking the bishop entertained him with a frown and exposed the plaint monseigneur said the cure right humbly doth the parish allege many things against me or this one only in sooth but this one said the bishop and softened a little first monseigneur i acknowledge the fact tis well quoth the bishop that saves time and trouble now to your excuse if excuse there be monseigneur i have been cure of that parish seven years and fifty children have i baptized and buried not five at first i used to say heaven be praised the air of this village is main healthy but on searching the register book i found twas always so and on probing the matter it came out that of those born at domfront all but here and there one did go and get hanged at aix but this was to defraud not their cure only but the entire church of her dues since pendards pay no funeral fees being buried in air thereupon knowing by sad experience their greed and how they grudge the church every sou i laid a trap to keep them from hanging for greed against greed there be of them that will die in their beds like true men ere the church shall gain those funeral fees for nought then the bishop laughed till the tears ran down and questioned the churchwarden and he was fain to confess that too many of the parish did come to that unlucky end at aix then said the bishop i do approve the act for myself and my successors and so be it ever till they mend their manners and die in their beds and the next day came the ringleaders crestfallen to the cure and said parson ye were even good to us barring this untoward matter prithee let there be no ill blood anent so trivial a thing and the cure said my children i were unworthy to be your pastor could i not forgive a wrong go in peace and get me as many children as may be that by the double fees the cure you love may miss starvation and the bishop often told the story and it kept his memory of the cure alive and at last he shifted him to a decent parish where he can offer a glass of old medoc to such as are worthy of it their name it is not legion a light broke in upon gerard his countenance showed it ay said his host i am that cure so now thou canst guess why i said at their old tricks my life ont they have wheedled my successor into remitting those funeral fees you are well out of that parish and so am i the cures little niece burst in uncle the weighingla a stranger and burst out the cure rose directly but would not part with gerard wet thy beard once more and come with me in the church porch they found the sexton with a huge pair of scales and weights of all sizes several humble persons were standing by and soon a woman stepped forward with a sickly child and said be it heavy be it light i vow in rye meal of the best whateer this child shall weigh and the same will duly pay to holy church an if he shall cast his trouble pray good people for this child and for me his mother hither come in dole and care the child was weighed and yelled as if the scale had been the font courage dame cried gerard this is a good sign there is plenty of life here to battle its trouble now blest be the tongue that tells me so said the poor woman she hushed her ponderling against her bosom and stood aloof watching whilst another woman brought her child to scale but presently a loud dictatorial voice was heard way there make way for the seigneur the small folk parted on both sides like waves ploughed by a lordly galley and in marched in gorgeous attire his cap adorned by a feather with a topaz at its root his jerkin richly furred satin doublet red hose shoes like skates diamondhilted sword in velvet scabbard and hawk on his wrist the lord of the manor he flung himself into the scales as if he was lord of the zodiac as well as the manor whereat the hawk balanced and flapped but stuck then winked while the sexton heaved in the great weights the cure told gerard my lord had been sick unto death and vowed his weight in bread and cheese to the poor the church taking her tenth permit me my lord if your lordship continues to press your lordships staff on the other scale you will disturb the balance his lordship grinned and removed his staff and leaned on it the cure politely but firmly objected to that too mille diables what am i to do with it then cried the other deign to hold it out so my lord wide of both scales when my lord did this and so fell into the trap he had laid for holy church the good cure whispered to gerard cretensis incidit in cretensem which i take to mean diamond cut diamond he then said with an obsequious air if that your lordship grudges heaven full weight you might set the hawk on your lacquey and so save a pound gramercy for thy rede cure cried the great man reproachfully shall i for one sorry pound grudge my poor fowl the benefit of holy church id as lieve the devil should have me and all my house as her any day i the year sweet is affection whispered the cure between a bird and a brute whispered gerard tush and the cure looked terrified the seigneurs weight was booked and heaven i trust and believe did not weigh his gratitude in the balance of the sanctuary for my unlearned reader is not to suppose there was anything the least eccentric in the man or his gratitude to the giver of health and all good gifts men look forward to death and back upon past sickness with different eyes item when men drive a bargain they strive to get the sunny side of it it matters not one straw whether it is with man or heaven they are bargaining in this respect we are the same now at bottom as we were four hundred years ago only in those days we did it a grain or two more naively and that naivete shone out more palpably because in that rude age body prevailing over mind all sentiments took material forms man repented with scourges prayed by bead bribed the saints with wax tapers put fish into the body to sanctify the soul sojourned in cold water for empire over the emotions and thanked god for returning health in cwt stone lb oz dwt of bread and cheese whilst i have been preaching who preach so rarely and so ill the good cure has been soliciting the lord of the manor to step into the church and give order what shall be done with his greatgreatgrandfather ods bodikins what have you dug him up nay my lord he never was buried what the old dict was true after all so true that the workmen this very day found a skeleton erect in the pillar they are repairing i had sent to my lord at once but i knew he would be here it is he tis he said his descendant quickening his pace let us go see the old boy this youth is a stranger i think gerard bowed know then that my greatgreatgrandfather held his head high and being on the point of death revolted against lying under the aisle with his forbears for mean folk to pass over so as the tradition goes he swore his son my greatgrandfather to bury him erect in one of the pillars of the church here they entered the porch for quoth he no base man shall pass over my stomach peste and even while speaking his lordship parried adroitly with his stick a skull that came hopping at him bowled by a boy in the middle of the aisle who took to his heels yelling with fear the moment he saw what he had done his lordship hurled the skull furiously after him as he ran at which the cure gave a shout of dismay and put forth his arm to hinder him but was too late the cure groaned aloud and as if this had evoked spirits of mischief up started a whole pack of children from some ambuscade and unseen but heard loud enough clattered out of the church like a covey rising in a thick wood oh these pernicious brats cried the cure the workmen cannot go to their nonemete but the church is rife with them pray heaven they have not found his late lordship nay i mind i hid his lordship under a workmens jerkin andsaints defend us the jerkin has been moved the poor cures worst misgivings were realized the rising generation of the plebians had played the mischief with the haughty old noble the little ones had jockeyed for the bones oh and pocketed such of them as seemed adapted for certain primitive games then in vogue amongst them ill excommunicate them roared the curate and all their race never heed said the scapegrace lord and stroked his hawk there is enough of him to swear by put him back put him back surely my lord tis your will his bones be laid in hallowed earth and masses said for his poor prideful soul the noble stroked his hawk are ye there master cure said he nay the business is too old he is out of purgatory by this time up or down i shall not draw my pursestrings for him every dog his day adieu messires adieu ancestor and he sauntered off whistling to his hawk and caressing it his reverence looked ruefully after him cretensis incidit in cretensem said he sorrowfully i thought i had him safe for a dozen masses yet i blame him not but that young neerdoweel which did trundle his ancestors skull at us for who could venerate his greatgreatgrandsire and play football with his head well it behoves us to be better christians than he is so they gathered the bones reverently and the cure locked them up and forbade the workmen who now entered the church to close up the pillar till he should recover by threats of the churchs wrath every atom of my lord and he showed gerard a famous shrine in the church before it were the usual gifts of tapers etc there was also a wax image of a falcon most curiously moulded and coloured to the life eyes and all gerards eye fell at once on this and he expressed the liveliest admiration the cure assented then gerard asked could the saint have loved hawking the cure laughed at his simplicity nay tis but a statuary hawk when they have a bird of gentle breed they cannot train they make his image and send it to this shrine with a present and pray the saint to work upon the stubborn mind of the original and make it ductile as wax that is the notion and methinks a reasonable one too gerard assented but alack reverend sir were i a saint methinks i should side with the innocent dove rather than with the cruel hawk that rends her by st denys you are right said the cure but que voulezvous the saints are debonair and have been flesh themselves and know mans frailty and absurdity tis the bishop of avignon sent this one what do bishops hawk in this country one and all every noble person hawks and lives with hawk on wrist why my lord abbot hard by and his lordship that has just parted from us had a two years feud as to where they should put their hawks down on that very altar there each claimed the right hand of the altar for his bird what desecration nay nay thou knowest we make them doff both glove and hawk to take the blessed eucharist their jewelled gloves will they give to a servant or simple christian to hold but their beloved hawks they will put down on no place less than the altar gerard inquired how the battle of the hawks ended why the abbot he yielded as the church yields to laymen he searched ancient books and found that the left hand was the more honourable being in truth the right hand since the altar is east but looks westward so he gave my lord the soidisant right hand and contented himself with the real right hand and even so may the church still outwit the lay nobles and their arrogance saving your presence nay sir i honour the church i am convent bred and owe all i have and am to holy church ah that accounts for my sudden liking to thee art a gracious youth come and see me whenever thou wilt gerard took this as a hint that he might go now it jumped with his own wish for he was curious to hear what denys had seen and done all this time he made his reverence and walked out of the church but was no sooner clear of it than he set off to run with all his might and tearing round a corner ran into a large stomach whose owner clutched him to keep himself steady under the shock but did not release his hold on regaining his equilibrium let go man said gerard not so you are my prisoner prisoner ay what for in heavens name what for why sorcery sorcery sorcery chapter xxxvii the culprits were condemned to stand pinioned in the marketplace for two hours that should any persons recognize them or any of them as guilty of other crimes they might depose to that effect at the trial they stood however the whole period and no one advanced anything fresh against them this was the less remarkable that they were night birds vampires who preyed in the dark on weary travellers mostly strangers but just as they were being taken down a fearful scream was heard in the crowd and a woman pointed at one of them with eyes almost starting from their sockets but ere she could speak she fainted away then men and women crowded round her partly to aid her partly from curiosity when she began to recover they fell to conjectures twas at him she pointed nay twas at this one nay nay said another twas at yon hangdog with the hair hung round his neck all further conjectures were cut short the poor creature no sooner recovered her senses than she flew at the landlord like a lioness my child man man give me back my child and she seized the glossy golden hair that the officers had hung round his neck and tore it from his neck and covered it with kisses then her poor confused mind clearing she saw even by this token that her lost girl was dead and sank suddenly down shrieking and sobbing so over the poor hair that the crowd rushed on the assassin with one savage growl his life had ended then and speedily for in those days all carried death at their girdles but denys drew his sword directly and shouting a moi camarades kept the mob at bay who lays a finger on him dies other archers backed him and with some difficulty they kept him uninjured while denys appealed to those who shouted for his blood what sort of vengeance is this would you be so mad as rob the wheel and give the vermin an easy death the mob was kept passive by the archers steel rather than by denyss words and growled at intervals with flashing eyes the municipal officers seeing this collected round and with the archers made a guard and prudently carried the accused back to gaol the mob hooted them and the prisoners indiscriminately denys saw the latter safely lodged then made for the white hart where he expected to find gerard on the way he saw two girls working at a firstfloor window he saluted them they smiled he entered into conversation their manners were easy their complexion high he invited them to a repast at the white hart they objected he acquiesced in their refusal they consented and in this charming society he forgot all about poor gerard who meantime was carried off to gaol but on the way suddenly stopped having now somewhat recovered his presence of mind and demanded to know by whose authority he was arrested by the vicebaillies said the constable the vicebaillie alas what have i a stranger done to offend a vicebaillie for this charge of sorcery must be a blind no sorcerer am i but a poor true lad far from his home this vague shift disgusted the officer show him the capias jacques said he jacques held out the writ in both hands about a yard and a half from gerards eye and at the same moment the large constable suddenly pinned him both officers were on tenterhooks lest the prisoner should grab the document to which they attached a superstitious importance but the poor prisoner had no such thought query whether he would have touched it with the tongs he just craned out his neck and read it and to his infinite surprise found the vicebailiff who had signed the writ was the friendly alderman he took courage and assured his captor there was some error but finding he made no impression demanded to be taken before the alderman what say you to that jacques impossible we have no orders to take him before his worship read the writ nay but good kind fellows what harm can it be i will give you each an ecu jacques what say you to that humph i say we have no orders not to take him to his worship read the writ then say we take him to prison round by his worship it was agreed they got the money and bade gerard observe they were doing him a favour he saw they wanted a little gratitude as well as much silver he tried to satisfy this cupidity but it stuck in his throat feigning was not his forte he entered the aldermans presence with his heart in his mouth and begged with faltering voice to know what he had done to offend since he left that very room with manon and denys nought that i know of said the alderman on the writ being shown him he told gerard he had signed it at daybreak i get old and my memory faileth me a discussing of the girl i quite forgot your own offence but i remember now all is well you are he i committed for sorcery stay ere you go to gaol you shall hear what your accuser says run and fetch him you the man could not find the accuser all at once so the alderman getting impatient told gerard the main charge was that he had set a dead body a burning with diabolical fire that flamed but did not consume and if tis true young man im sorry for thee for thou wilt assuredly burn with fire of good pine logs in the marketplace of neufchasteau oh sir for pitys sake let me have speech with his reverence the cure the alderman advised gerard against it the church was harder upon sorcerers than was the corporation but sir i am innocent said gerard between snarling and whining oh if you think you are innocentofficer go with him to the cure but see he scape you not innocent quotha they found the cure in his doublet repairing a wheelbarrow gerard told him all and appealed piteously to him just for using a little phosphorus in selfdefence against cutthroats they are going to hang it was lucky for our magician that he had already told his tale in full to the cure for thus that shrewd personage had hold of the stick at the right end the corporation held it by the ferule his reverence looked exceedingly grave and said i must question you privately on this untoward business he took him into a private room and bade the officer stand outside and guard the door and be ready to come if called the big constable stood outside the door quaking and expecting to see the room fly away and leave a stink of brimstone instantly they were alone the cure unlocked his countenance and was himself again show me the trick ont said he all curiosity i cannot sir unless the room be darkened the cure speedily closed out the light with a wooden shutter now then but on what shall i put it said gerard here is no dead face twas that made it look so dire the cure groped about the room good here is an image tis my patron saint heaven forbid that were profanation pshaw twill rub off willt not ay but it goes against me to take such liberty with a saint objected the sorcerer fiddlestick said the divine to be sure by putting it on his holiness will show your reverence it is no satanic art mayhap twas for that i did propose it said the cure subtly thus encouraged gerard fired the eyes and nostrils of the image and made the cure jump then lighted up the hair in patches and set the whole face shining like a glowworms byr lady shouted the cure tis strange and small my wonder that they took you for a magician seeing a dead face thus fired now come thy ways with me he put on his grey gown and great hat and in a few minutes they found themselves in presence of the alderman by his side poisoning his mind stood the accuser a singular figure in red hose and red shoes a black gown with blue bands and a cocked hat after saluting the alderman the cure turned to this personage and said goodhumouredly so mangis at thy work again babbling away honest mens lives come your worship this is the old tale two of a trade can neer agree here is mangis who professes sorcery and would sell himself to satan tonight but that satan is not so weak as buy what he can have gratis this mangis who would be a sorcerer but is only a quacksalver accuses of magic a true lad who did but use in selfdefence a secret of chemistry wellknown to me and all churchmen but he is no churchman to dabble in such mysteries objected the alderman he is more churchman than layman being convent bred and in the lesser orders said the ready cure therefore sorcerer withdraw thy plaint without more words that i will not your reverence replied mangis stoutly a sorcerer i am but a white one not a black one i make no pact with satan but on the contrary still battle him with lawful and necessary arts i neer profane the sacraments as do the black sorcerers nor turn myself into a cat and go sucking infants blood nor een their breath nor set dead men o fire i but tell the peasants when their cattle and their hens are possessed and at what time of the moon to plant rye and what days in each month are lucky for wooing of women and selling of bullocks and so forth above all it is my art and my trade to detect the black magicians as i did that whole tribe of them who were burnt at dol but last year ay mangis and what is the upshot of that famous fire thy tongue did kindle why their ashes were cast to the wind ay but the true end of thy comedy is this the parliament of dijon hath since sifted the matter and found they were no sorcerers but good and peaceful citizens and but last week did order masses to be said for their souls and expiatory farces and mysteries to be played for them in seven towns of burgundy all which will not of those cinders make men and women again now tis our custom in this land when we have slain the innocent by hearkening false knaves like thee not to blame our credulous ears but the false tongue that gulled them therefore bethink thee that at a word from me to my lord bishop thou wilt smell burning pine nearer than eer knave smelt it and lived and wilt travel on a smoky cloud to him whose heart thou bearest for the word devil in the latin it meaneth false accuser and whose livery thou wearest and the cure pointed at mangis with his staff that is true ifegs said the alderman for red and black be the foul fiendys colours by this time the white sorcerers cheek was as colourless as his dress was fiery indeed the contrast amounted to pictorial he stammered out i respect holy church and her will he shall fire the churchyard and all in it for me i do withdraw the plaint then withdraw thyself said the vicebailiff the moment he was gone the cure took the conversational tone and told the alderman courteously that the accused had received the chemical substance from holy church and had restored it her by giving it all to him then tis in good hands was the reply young man you are free let me have your reverences prayers doubt it not humph vicebaillie the town owes me four silver franks this three months and more they shall be paid cure ay ere the week be out on this good understanding church and state parted as soon as he was in the street gerard caught the priests hand and kissed it oh sir oh your reverence you have saved me from the fiery stake what can i say what do what nought foolish lad bounty rewards itself nathelesshumphi wish i had donet without leasing it ill becomes my function to utter falsehoods falsehood sir gerard was mystified didst not hear me say thou hadst given me that same phosphorus twill cost me a fortnights penance that light word the cure sighed and his eye twinkled cunningly nay nay cried gerard eagerly now heaven forbid that was no falsehood father well you knew the phosphorus was yours is yours and he thrust the bottle into the cures hand but alas tis too poor a gift will you not take from my purse somewhat for holy church and now he held out his purse with glistening eyes nay said the other brusquely and put his hands quickly behind him not a doit fie fie art pauper et exul come thou rather each day at noon and take thy diet with me for my heart warms to thee and he went off very abruptly with his hands behind him they itched but they itched in vain where theres a heart theres a rubicon gerard went hastily to the inn to relieve denys of the anxiety so long and mysterious an absence must have caused him he found him seated at his ease playing dice with two young ladies whose manners were unreserved and complexion high gerard was hurt noubliez point la jeanneton said he colouring up what of her said denys gaily rattling the dice she said le peu que sont les femmes oh did she and what say you to that mesdemoiselles we say that none run women down but such as are too old or too illfavoured or too witless to please them witless quotha wise men have not folly enough to please them nor madness enough to desire to please them said gerard loftily but tis to my comrade i speak not to you you brazen toads that make so free with a man at first sight preach away comrade fling a byword or two at our heads know girls that he is a very solomon for bywords methinks he was brought up by hand on em be thy friendship a byword retorted gerard the friendship that melts to nought at sight of a farthingale malheureux cried denys i speak but pellets and thou answerest daggers would i could was the reply adieu what a little savage said one of the girls gerard opened the door and put in his head i have thought of a byword said he spitefully qui hante femmes et dez il mourra en pauvretez there and having delivered this thunderbolt of antique wisdom he slammed the door viciously ere any of them could retort and now being somewhat exhausted by his anxieties he went to the bar for a morsel of bread and a cup of wine the landlord would sell nothing less than a pint bottle well then he would have a bottle but when he came to compare the contents of the bottle with its size great was the discrepancy on this he examined the bottle keenly and found that the glass was thin where the bottle tapered but towards the bottom unnaturally thick he pointed this out at once the landlord answered superciliously that he did not make bottles and was nowise accountable for their shape that we will see presently said gerard i will take this thy pint to the vicebailiff nay nay for heavens sake cried the landlord changing his tone at once i love to content my customers if by chance this pint be short we will charge it and its fellow three sous insteads of two sous each so be it but much i admire that you the host of so fair an inn should practise thus the wine too smacketh strongly of spring water young sir said the landlord we cut no travellers throats at this inn as they do at most however you know all about that the white hart is no lion nor bear whatever masterful robbery is done here is done upon the poor host how then could he live at all if he dealt not a little crooked with the few who pay gerard objected to this system root and branch honest trade was small profits quick returns and neither to cheat nor be cheated the landlord sighed at this picture so might one keep an inn in heaven but not in burgundy when foot soldiers going to the wars are quartered on me how can i but lose by their custom two sous per day is their pay and they eat two sous worth and drink into the bargain the pardoners are my good friends but palmers and pilgrims what think you i gain by them marry a loss minstrels and jongleurs draw custom and so claim to pay no score except for liquor by the secular monks i neither gain nor lose but the black and grey friars have made vow of poverty but not of famine eat like wolves and give the poor host nought but their prayers and mayhap not them how can he tell in my fathers day we had the weddings but now the great gentry let their houses and their plates their mugs and their spoons to any honest couple that want to wed and thither the very mechanics go with their brides and bridal train they come not to us indeed we could not find seats and vessels for such a crowd as eat and drink and dance the week out at the homeliest wedding now in my fathers day the great gentry sold wine by the barrel only but now they have leave to cry it and sell it by the galopin in the very marketplace how can we vie with them they grow it we buy it of the grower the coroners quests we have still and these would bring goodly profit but the meat is aye gone ere the mouths be full you should make better provision suggested his hearer the law will not let us we are forbidden to go into the market for the first hour so when we arrive the burghers have bought all but the refuse besides the law forbids us to buy more than three bushels of meal at a time yet market day comes but once a week as for the butchers they will not kill for us unless we bribe them courage said gerard kindly the shoe pinches every trader somewhere ay but not as it pinches us our shoe is trode all o one side as well as pinches us lame a savoir if we pay not the merchants we buy meal meat and wine of they can cast us into prison and keep us there till we pay or die but we cannot cast into prison those who buy those very victuals of us a travellers horse we may keep for his debt but where in heavens name in our own stable eating his head off at our cost nay we may keep the traveller himself but where in gaol nay in our own good house and there must we lodge and feed him gratis and so fling good silver after bad merci no let him go with a wanion our honestest customers are the thieves would to heaven there were more of them they look not too close into the shape of the canakin nor into the hosts reckoning with them and with their purses tis lightly come and lightly go also they spend freely not knowing but each carouse may be their last but the thieftakers instead of profiting by this fair example are for ever robbing the poor host when noble or honest travellers descend at our door come the provosts men pretending to suspect them and demanding to search them and their papers to save which offence the host must bleed wine and meat then come the excise to examine all your weights and measures you must stop their mouths with meat and wine town excise royal excise parliament excise a swarm of them and all with a wolf in their stomachs and a sponge in their gullets monks friars pilgrims palmers soldiers excisemen provostmarshals and men and mere bad debtors how can the white hart butt against all these cutting no throats in selfdefence as do your swans and roses and boars heads and red lions and eagles your moons stars and moors how can the white hart give a pint of wine for a pint and everything risen so why lad not a pound of bread i sell but cost me three good copper deniers twelve to the sou and each pint of wine bought by the tun costs me four deniers every sack of charcoal two sous and gone in a day a pair of partridges five sous what think you of that heard one ever the like five sous for two little beasts all bone and feather a pair of pigeons thirty deniers tis ruination for we may not raise our pricen with the market oh no i tell thee the shoe is trode all o one side as well as pinches the water into our eyn we may charge nought for mustard pepper salt or firewood think you we get them for nought candle it is a sou the pound salt five sous the stone pepper four sous the pound mustard twenty deniers the pint and raw meat dwindleth it on the spit with no cost to me but loss of weight why what think you i pay my cook but you shall never guess a hundred sous a year as i am a living sinner and my waiter thirty sous besides his perquisites he is a hantle richer than i am and then to be insulted as well as pillaged last sunday i went to church it is a place i trouble not often didnt the cure lash the hotelkeepers i grant you he hit all the trades except the one that is a byword for looseness and pride and sloth to wit the clergy but mind you he stripeit the other lay estates with a feather but us hotelkeepers with a neats pizzle godless for this godless for that and most godless of all for opening our doors during mass why the law forces us to open at all hours to travellers from another town stopping halting or passing those be the words they can fine us before the bailiff if we refuse them mass or no mass and say a townsman should creep in with the true travellers are we to blame they all vow they are tired wayfarers and can i ken every face in a great town like this so if we respect the law our poor souls are to suffer and if we respect it not our poor lank purses must bleed at two holes fine and loss of custom a man speaking of himself in general is a babbling brook of his wrongs a shining river labitur et labetur in omne volubilis aevum so luckily for my readers though not for all concerned this injured orator was arrested in mid career another man burst in upon his wrongs with all the advantage of a recent wrong a wrong red hot it was denys cursing and swearing and crying that he was robbed did those hussies pass this way who are they where do they bide they have taen my purse and fifteen golden pieces raise the hue and cry ah traitresses vipers these inns are all guetapens there now cried the landlord to gerard gerard implored him to be calm and say how it had befallen first one went out on some pretence then after a while the other went to fetch her back and neither returning i clapped hand to purse and found it empty the ungrateful creatures i was letting them win it in a gallop but loaded dice were not quick enough they must claw it all in a lump gerard was for going at once to the alderman and setting the officers to find them not i said denys i hate the law no as it came so let it go gerard would not give it up so at a hint from the landlord he forced denys along with him to the provostmarshal that dignitary shook his head we have no clue to occasional thieves that work honestly at their needles till some gull comes and tempts them with an easy booty and then they pluck him come away cried denys furiously i knew what use a bourgeois would be to me at a pinch and he marched off in a rage they are clear of the town ere this said gerard speak no more ont if you prize my friendship i have five pieces with the bailiff and ten i left with manon luckily or these traitresses had feathered their nest with my last plume what dost gape for so nay i do ill to vent my choler on thee ill tell thee all art wiser than i what saidst thou at the door no matter well then i did offer marriage to that manon gerard was dumfounded what you offered her what marriage is that such a mighty strange thing to offer a wench tis a strange thing to offer to a strange girl in passing nay i am not such a sot as you opine i saw the corn in all that chaff i knew i could not get her by fair means so i was fain to try foul mademoiselle said i marriage is not one of my habits but struck by your qualities i make an exception deign to bestow this hand on me and she bestowed it on thine ear not so on the contrary sheart a disrespectful young monkey know that here not being holland or any other barbarous state courtesy begets courtesy says she a colouring like a rose soldier you are too late he is not a patch on you for looks but thenhe has loved me a long time he who tother what other why he that was not too late oh that is the way they all speak the loves the shewolves their little minds go in leaps think you they marshal their words in order of battle their tongues are in too great a hurry says she i love him not not to say love him but he does me and dearly and for that reason id sooner die than cause him grief i would now i believe she did love him who doubts that why she said so round about as they always say these things and with nay for ay well one thing led to another and at last as she could not give me her hand she gave me a piece of advice and that was to leave part of my money with the young mistress then when bad company had cleaned me out i should have some to travel back with said she i said i would better her advice and leave it with her her face got red says she think what you do chambermaids have an ill name for honesty oh the devil is not so black as he is painted said i ill risk it and i left fifteen gold pieces with her gerard sighed i wish you may ever see them again it is wondrous in what esteem you do hold this sex to trust so to the first comer for my part i know little about them i never saw but one i could love as well as i love thee but the ancients must surely know and they held women cheap levius quid femina said they which is but la jeannetons tune in latin le peu que sont les femmes also do but see how the greybeards of our own day speak of them being no longer blinded by desire this alderman to wit oh novice of novices cried denys not to have seen why that old fool rails so on the poor things one day out of the millions of women he blackens one did prefer some other man to him for which solitary piece of bad taste and ten to one twas good taste he doth bespatter creations fairer half thereby proving what le peu que sont les hommes i see women have a shrewd champion in thee said gerard with a smile but the next moment inquired gravely why he had not told him all this before denys grinned had the girl said ay why then i had told thee straight but tis a rule with us soldiers never to publish our defeats tis much if after each check we claim not a victory now that is true said gerard young as i am i have seen this that after every great battle the generals on both sides go to the nearest church and sing each a te deum for the victory methinks a te martem or te bellonam or te mercurium mercury being the god of lies were more fitting pas si bete said denys approvingly hast a good eye canst see a steeple by daylight so now tell me how thou hast fared in this town all day come said gerard tis well thou hast asked me for else i had never told thee he then related in full how he had been arrested and by what a providential circumstance he had escaped long imprisonment or speedy conflagration his narrative produced an effect he little expected or desired i am a traitor cried denys i left thee in a strange place to fight thine own battles while i shook the dice with those jades now take thou this sword and pass it through my body forthwith what for in heavens name inquired gerard for an example roared denys for a warning to all false loons that profess friendship and disgrace it oh very well said gerard yes not a bad notion where will you have it here through my heart that is where other men have a heart but i none or a satanic false one gerard made a motion to run him through and flung his arms round his neck instead i know no way to thy heart but this thou great silly thing denys uttered an exclamation then hugged him warmlyand quite overcome by this sudden turn of youthful affection and native grace gulped out in a broken voice railest on womenand artlike themwith thy pretty ways thy mothers milk is in thee still satan would love thee orle bon dieu would kick him out of hell for shaming it give me thy hand give me thy hand may a tremendous oath if i let thee out of my sight till italy and so the staunch friends were more than reconciled after their short tiff the next day the thieves were tried the pieces de conviction were reduced in number to the great chagrin of the little clerk by the interment of the bones but there was still a pretty show a thiefs hand struck off flagrante delicto a murdered womans hair the abbots axe and other tools of crime the skulls etc were sworn to by the constables who had found them evidence was lax in that age and place they all confessed but the landlord and manon was called to bring the crime home to him her evidence was conclusive he made a vain attempt to shake her credibility by drawing from her that her own sweetheart had been one of the gang and that she had held her tongue so long as he was alive the public prosecutor came to the aid of his witness and elicited that a knife had been held to her throat and her own sweetheart sworn with solemn oaths to kill her should she betray them and that this terrible threat and not the mere fear of death had glued her lips the other thieves were condemned to be hanged and the landlord to be broken on the wheel he uttered a piercing cry when his sentence was pronounced as for poor manon she became the subject of universal criticism nor did opinion any longer run dead in her favour it divided into two broad currents and strange to relate the majority of her own sex took her part and the males were but equally divided which hardly happens once in a hundred years perhaps some lady will explain the phenomenon as for me i am a little shy of explaining things i dont understand it has become so common meantime had she been a lover of notoriety she would have been happy for the town talked of nothing but her the poor girl however had but one wish to escape the crowd that followed her and hide her head somewhere where she could cry over her pendard whom all these proceedings brought vividly back to her affectionate remembrance before he was hanged he had threatened her life but she was not one of your fastidious girls who love their male divinities any the less for beating them kicking them or killing them but rather the better provided these attentions are interspersed with occasional caresses so it would have been odd indeed had she taken offence at a mere threat of that sort he had never threatened her with a rival she sobbed singlemindedly meantime the inn was filled with thirsters for a sight of her who feasted and drank to pass away the time till she should deign to appear when she had been sobbing some time there was a tap at her door and the landlord entered with a proposal nay weep not good lass your fortune it is made an you like say the word and you are chambermaid of the white hart nay nay said manon with a fresh burst of grief never more will i be a servant in an inn ill go to my mother the landlord consoled and coaxed her and she became calmer but none the less determined against his proposal the landlord left her but ere long he returned and made her another proposal would she be his wife and landlady of the white hart you do ill to mock me said she sorrowfully nay sweetheart i mock thee not i am too old for sorry jests say you the word and you are my partner for better for worse she looked at him and saw he was in earnest on this she suddenly rained hard to the memory of le pendard the tears came in a torrent being the last and she gave her hand to the landlord of the white hart and broke a gold crown with him in sign of plighted troth we will keep it dark till the house is quiet said the landlord ay said she but meantime prithee give me linen to hem or work to do for the time hangs on me like lead her betrotheds eye brightened at this housewifely request and he brought her up two dozen flagons of various sizes to clean and polish she gathered complacency as she reflected that by a strange turn of fortune all this bright pewter was to be hers meantime the landlord went downstairs and falling in with our friends drew them aside into the bar he then addressed denys with considerable solemnity we are old acquaintances and you want not for sagacity now advise me in a strait my custom is somewhat declining this girl manon is the talk of the town see how full the inn is tonight she doth refuse to be my chambermaid i have half a mind to marry her what think you shall i say the word denys in reply merely open his eyes wide with amazement the landlord turned to gerard with a halfinquiring look nay sir said gerard i am too young to advise my seniors and betters no matter let us hear your thought well sir it was said of a good wife by the ancients bene quae latuit bene vixit that is she is the best wife that is least talked of but here male quae patuit were as near the mark therefore an you bear the lass goodwill why not club purses with denys and me and convey her safe home with a dowry then mayhap some rustical person in her own place may be brought to wife her why so many words said denys this old fox is not the ass he affects to be oh that is your advice is it said the landlord testily well then we shall soon know who is the fool you or me for i have spoken to her as it happens and what is more she has said ay and she is polishing the flagons at this moment oho said denys drily twas an ambuscade well in that case my advice is run for the notary tie the noose and let us three drink the brides health till we see six sots atippling and shall ay now you utter sense in ten minutes a civil marriage was effected upstairs before a notary and his clerk and our two friends in ten minutes more the white hind dead sick of seclusion had taken her place within the bar and was serving out liquids and bustling and her colour rising a little in six little minutes more she soundly rated a careless servantgirl for carrying a nipperkin of wine awry and spilling good liquor during the evening she received across the bar eight offers of marriage some of them from respectable burghers now the landlord and our two friends had in perfect innocence ensconced themselves behind a screen to drink at their ease the new couples health the above comedy was thrown in for their entertainment by bounteous fate they heard the proposals made one after another and uninventive manons invariable answerserviteur you are a day after the fair the landlord chuckled and looked goodnatured superiority at both his late advisers with their traditional notions that men shun a woman quae patuit ie who has become the town talk but denys scarce noticed the spouses triumph over him he was so occupied with his own over gerard at each municipal tender of undying affection he turned almost purple with the effort it cost him not to roar with glee and driving his elbow into the deepmeditating and muchpuzzled pupil of antiquity whispered le peu que sont les hommes the next morning gerard was eager to start but denys was under a vow to see the murderers of the goldenhaired girl executed gerard respected his vow but avoided his example he went to bid the cure farewell instead and sought and received his blessing about noon the travellers got clear of the town just outside the south gate they passed the gallows it had eight tenants the skeleton of manons late wept and now being fast forgotten lover and the bodies of those who had so nearly taken our travellers lives a hand was nailed to the beam and hard by on a huge wheel was clawed the dead landlord with every bone in his body broken to pieces gerard averted his head and hurried by denys lingered and crowed over his dead foes times are changed my lads since we two sat shaking in the cold awaiting you seven to come and cut our throats fie denys death squares all reckonings prithee pass on without another word if you prize my respect a groat to this earnest remonstrance denys yielded he even said thoughtfully you have been better brought up than i about three in the afternoon they reached a little town with the people buzzing in knots the wolves starved by the cold had entered and eaten two grownup persons overnight in the main street so some were blaming the eatennone but fools or knaves are about after nightfall others the law for not protecting the town and others the corporation for not enforcing what laws there were bah this is nothing to us said denys and was for resuming their march ay but tis remonstrated gerard what are we the pair they ate no but we may be the next pair ay neighbour said an ancient man tis the towns fault for not obeying the ducal ordinance which bids every shopkeeper light a lamp oer his door at sunset and burn it till sunrise on this denys asked him somewhat derisively what made him fancy rush dips would scare away empty wolves why mutton fat is all their joy tis not the fat vain man but the light all ill things hate light especially wolves and the imps that lurk i ween under their fur example paris city stands in a wood like and the wolves do howl around it all night yet of late years wolves come but little in the streets for why in that burgh the watchmen do thunder at each door that is dark and make the weary wight rise and light tis my son tells me he is a great voyager my son nicholas in further explanation he assured them that previously to that ordinance no city had been worse infested with wolves than paris a troop had boldly assaulted the town in and in they had eaten fourteen persons in a single month between montmartre and the gate st antoine and that not a winter month even but september and as for the dead which nightly lay in the streets slain in midnight brawls or assassinated the wolves had used to devour them and to grub up the fresh graves in the churchyards and tear out the bodies here a thoughtful citizen suggested that probably the wolves had been bridled of late in paris not by candlelights but owing to the english having been driven out of the kingdom of france for those english be very wolves themselves for fierceness and greediness what marvel then that under their rule our neighbours of france should be wolfeaten this logic was too suited to the time and place not to be received with acclamation but the old man stood his ground i grant ye those islanders are wolves but twolegged ones and little apt to favour their fourfooted cousins one greedy thing loveth it another i trow not by the same token and this too i have from my boy nicole sir wolf dare not show his nose in london city though tis smaller than paris and thick woods hard by the north wall and therein great store of deer and wild boars as rife as flies at midsummer sir said gerard you seem conversant with wild beasts prithee advise my comrade here and me we would not waste time on the road an if we may go forward to the next town with reasonable safety young man i trow twere an idle risk it lacks but an hour of dusk and you must pass nigh a wood where lurk some thousands of these halfstarved vermin rank cowards single but in great bands bold as lions wherefore i rede you sojourn here the night and journey on betimes by the dawn the vermin will be tired out with roaring and rampaging and mayhap will have filled their lank bellies with flesh of my good neighbours here the unteachable fools gerard hoped not and asked could he recommend them to a good inn humph there is the tete dor my grandaughter keeps it she is a mijauree but not so knavish as most hotelkeepers and her house indifferent clean hey for the tete dor struck in denys decided by his ineradicable foible on the way to it gerard inquired of his companion what a mijauree was denys laughed at his ignorance not know what a mijauree is why all the world knows that it is neither more nor less than a mijauree as they entered the tete dor they met a young lady richly dressed with a velvet chaperon on her head which was confined by law to the nobility they unbonneted and louted low and she curtsied but fixed her eye on vacancy the while which had a curious rather than a genial effect however nobility was not so unassuming in those days as it is now so they were little surprised but the next minute supper was served and lo in came this princess and carved the goose holy st bavon cried gerard twas the landlady all the while a young woman cursed with nice white teeth and lovely hands for these beauties being misallied to homely features had turned her head she was a feeble carver carving not for the sake of others but herself ie to display her hands when not carving she was eternally either taking a pin out of her head or her body or else putting a pin into her head or her body to display her teeth she laughed indifferently at gay or grave and from ear to ear and she sat at ease with her mouth ajar now there is an animal in creation of no great general merit but it has the eye of a hawk for affectation it is called a boy and gerard was but a boy still in some things swift to see and to loath affectation so denys sat casting sheeps eyes and gerard daggers at one comedian presently in the midst of her minauderies she gave a loud shriek and bounded out of her chair like hare from form and ran backwards out of the room uttering little screams and holding her farthingale tight down to her ankles with both hands and as she scuttled out of the door a mouse scuttled back to the wainscot in a state of equal and perhaps more reasonable terror the guests who had risen in anxiety at the principal yell now stood irresolute awhile then sat down laughing the tender denys to whom a womans cowardice being a sexual trait seemed to be a lovely and pleasant thing said he would go comfort her and bring her back nay nay nay for pitys sake let her bide cried gerard earnestly oh blessed mouse sure some saint sent thee to our aid now at his right hand sat a sturdy middleaged burgher whose conduct up to date had been cynical he had never budged nor even rested his knife at all this fracas he now turned on gerard and inquired haughtily whether he really thought that grimaciere was afraid of a mouse ay she screamed hearty where is the coquette that cannot scream to the life these she tavernkeepers do still ape the nobles some princess or duchess hath lain here a night that was honestly afeard of a mouse having been brought up to it and this ape hath seen her and said i will start at a mouse and make a coil she has no more right to start at a mouse than to wear that fur on her bosom and that velvet on her monkeys head i am of the town young man and have known the mijauree all her life and i mind when she was no more afeard of a mouse than she is of a man he added that she was fast emptying the inn with these singeries all the world is so sick of her hands that her very kinsfolk will not venture themselves anigh them he concluded with something like a sigh the tete dor was a thriving hostelry under my old chum her good father but she is digging its grave tooth and nail tooth and nail good a right merry conceit and a true said gerard but the right merry conceit was an inadvertence as pure as snow and the stout burgher went to his grave and never knew what he had done for just then attention was attracted by denys returning pompously he inspected the apartment minutely and with a high official air he also looked solemnly under the table and during the whole inquisition a white hand was placed conspicuously on the edge of the open door and a tremulous voice inquired behind it whether the horrid thing was quite gone the enemy has retreated bag and baggage said denys and handed in the trembling fair who sitting down apologized to her guests for her foolish fears with so much earnestness grace and seeming selfcontempt that but for a sour grin on his neighbours face gerard would have been taken in as all the other strangers were dinner ended the young landlady begged an augustine friar at her right hand to say grace he delivered a longish one the moment he began she clapped her white hands piously together and held them up joined for mortals to admire tis an excellent pose for taper white fingers and cast her eyes upward towards heaven and felt as thankful to it as a magpie does while cutting off with your thimble after supper the two friends went to the streetdoor and eyed the marketplace the mistress joined them and pointed out the townhall the borough gaol st catherines church etc this was courteous to say the least but the true cause soon revealed itself the fair hand was poked right under their eyes every time an object was indicated and gerard eyed it like a basilisk and longed for a bunch of nettles the sun set and the travellers few in number drew round the great roaring fire and omitting to go on the spit were frozen behind though roasted in front for if the german stoves were oppressively hot the french salles manger were bitterly cold and above all stormy in germany men sat bareheaded round the stove and took off their upper clothes but in burgundy they kept on their hats and put on their warmest furs to sit round the great open chimney places at which the external air rushed furiously from door and illfitting window however it seems their mediaeval backs were broad enough to bear it for they made themselves not only comfortable but merry and broke harmless jests over each other in turn for instance denyss new shoes though not in direct communication had this day exploded with twinlike sympathy and unanimity where do you buy your shoon soldier asked one denys looked askant at gerard and not liking the theme shook it off i gather em off the trees by the roadside said he surlily then you gathered these too ripe said the hostess who was only a fool externally ay rotten ripe observed another inspecting them gerard said nothing but pointed the circular satire by pantomime he slily put out both his feet one after another under denyss eye with their german shoes on which a hundred leagues of travel had produced no effect they seemed hewn out of a rock at this ill twist the smooth varlets neck that sold me mine shouted denys in huge wrath and confirmed the threat with singular oaths peculiar to the mediaeval military the landlady put her fingers in her ears thereby exhibiting the hand in a fresh attitude tell me when he has done his orisons somebody said she mincingly and after that they fell to telling stories gerard when his turn came told the adventure of denys and gerard at the inn in domfront and so well that the hearers were rapt into sweet oblivion of the very existence of mijauree and hands but this made her very uneasy and she had recourse to her grand coup this misdirected genius had for a twelvemonth past practised yawning and could do it now at any moment so naturally as to set all creation gaping could all creation have seen her by this means she got in all her charms for first she showed her teeth then out of good breeding you know closed her mouth with three taper fingers so the moment gerards story got too interesting and absorbing she turned to and made yawns and croix sur la bouche this was all very fine but gerard was an artist and artists are chilled by gaping auditors he bore up against the yawns a long time but finding they came from a bottomless reservoir lost both heart and temper and suddenly rising in mid narrative said but i weary our hostess and i am tired myself so good night whipped a candle off the dresser whispered denys i cannot stand her and marched to bed in a moment the mijauree coloured and bit her lips she had not intended her byplay for gerards eye and she saw in a moment she had been rude and silly and publicly rebuked she sat with cheek on fire and a little natural water in her eyes and looked ten times comelier and more womanly and interesting than she had done all day the desertion of the best narrator broke up the party and the unassuming denys approached the meditative mijauree and invited her in the most flattering terms to gamble with him she started from her reverie looked him down into the earths centre with chilling dignity and consented for she remembered all in a moment what a show of hands gambling admitted the soldier and the mijauree rattled the dice in which sport she was so taken up with her hands that she forgot to cheat and denys won an ecu au soleil of her she fumbled slowly with her purse partly because her sex do not burn to pay debts of honour partly to admire the play of her little knuckles peeping between their soft white cushions denys proposed a compromise three silver franks i win of you fair hostess give me now three kisses of this white hand and well een cry quits you are malapert said the lady with a toss of her head besides they are so dirty see they are like ink and to convince him she put them out to him and turned them up and down they were no dirtier than cream fresh from the cob and she knew it she was eternally washing and scenting them denys read the objection like the observant warrior he was seized them and mumbled them finding him so appreciative of her charm she said timidly will you do me a kindness good soldier a thousand fair hostess an you will nay i ask but one tis to tell thy comrade i was right sorry to lose his most thrilling story and i hope he will tell me the rest tomorrow morning meantime i shall not sleep for thinking ont wilt tell him thatto pleasure me ay ill tell the young savage but he is not worthy of your condescension sweet hostess he would rather be aside a man than a woman any day so wouldahem he is right the young women of the day are not worthy of him un tas des mijaurees he has a good honest and right comely face any way i would not guest of mine should think me unmannerly not for all the world wilt keep faith with me and tell him on this fair hand i swear it and thus i seal the pledge there no need to melt the wax though now go to bed and tell him ere you sleep the perverse toad i thank thee manon for teaching me that word was inclined to bestow her slight affections upon gerard not that she was inflammable far less so than many that passed for prudes in the town but gerard possessed a triple attraction that has ensnared coquettes in all ages he was very handsome he did not admire her the least he had given her a good slap in the face denys woke gerard and gave the message gerard was not enchanted dost wake a tired man to tell him that am i to be pestered with mijaurees by night as well as day but i tell thee novice thou hast conquered her trust to my experience her voice sank to melodious whispers and the cunning jade did in a manner bribe me to carry thee her challenge to loves lists for so i read her message denys then assuming the senior and the man of the world told gerard the time was come to show him how a soldier understood friendship and camaraderie italy was now out of the question fate had provided better and the blind jade fortune had smiled on merit for once the head of gold had been a prosperous inn would be again with a man at its head a good general laid farsighted plans but was always ready to abandon them should some brilliant advantage offer and to reap the full harvest of the unforeseen twas chiefly by this trait great leaders defeated little ones for these latter could do nothing not cut and dried beforehand sorry friendship that would marry me to a mijauree interposed gerard yawning comrade be reasonable tis not the friskiest sheep that falls down the cliff all creatures must have their fling soon or late and why not a woman what more frivolous than a kitten what graver than a cat hast a good eye for nature denys said gerard that i proclaim a better for thine interest boy trust then to me these little doves they are my study day and night happy the man whose wife taketh her fling before wedlock and who trippeth up the altarsteps instead of down em marriage it always changeth them for better or else for worse why gerard she is honest when all is done and he is no man nor half a man that cannot mould any honest lass like a bit of warm wax and she aye aside him at bed and board i tell thee in one month thou wilt make of this coquette the matron the most sober in the town and of all its wives the one most docile and submissive why she is half tamed already nine in ten meek and mild ones had gently hated thee like poison all their lives for wounding of their hidden pride but she for an affront proffers affection by joshua his bugle a generous lass and void of petty malice when thou wast gone she sat athinking and spoke not a sure sign of love in one of her sex for of all things else they speak ere they think also her voice did sink exceeding low in discoursing of thee and murmured sweetly another infallible sign the bolt hath struck and rankles in her oh be joyful art silent i see tis settled i shall go alone to remiremont alone and sad but pillage and poleaxes what care i for that since my dear comrade will stay here landlord of the tete dor and safe from all the storms of life wilt think of me gerard now and then by thy warm fire of me camped on some windy heath or lying in wet trenches or wounded on the field and far from comfort nay and this he said in a manner truly noble not comfortless or cold or wet or bleeding twill still warm my heart to lie on my back and think that i have placed my dear friend and comrade true in the tete dor far from a soldiers ills i let you run on dear denys said gerard softly because at each word you show me the treasure of a good heart but now bethink thee my troth is plighted there where my heart it clingeth you so leal would you make me disloyal perdition seize me but i forgot that said denys no more then but hie thee to bed good denys next to margaret i love thee best on earth and value thy coeur dor far more than a dozen of these tetes dor so prithee call me at the first blush of rosyfingered morn and lets away ere the woman with the hands be stirring they rose with the dawn and broke their fast by the kitchen fire denys inquired of the girl whether the mistress was about nay but she hath risen from her bed by the same token i am carrying her this to clean her withal and she filled a jug with boiling water and took it upstairs behold said gerard the very elements must be warmed to suit her skin what had the saints said which still chose the coldest pool away ere she come down and catch us they paid the score and left the tete dor while its mistress was washing her hands chapter xxxviii outside the town they found the snow fresh trampled by innumerable wolves every foot of the road we did well to take the old mans advice denys ay did we for now i think ont i did hear them last night scurrying under our window and howling and whining for mans flesh in yon marketplace but no fat burgher did pity the poor vagabones and drop out o window gerard smiled but with an air of abstraction and they plodded on in silence what dost meditate so profoundly thy goodness denys was anything but pleased at this answer amongst his oddities you may have observed that he could stand a great deal of real impertinence he was so goodhumoured but would fire up now and then where not even the shadow of a ground for anger existed a civil question merits a civil reply said he very drily alas i meant no other said gerard then why pretend you were thinking of my goodness when you know i have no goodness under my skin had another said this i had answered thou liest but to thee i say hast no eye for mens qualities but only for womens and once more i do defy thy unreasonable choler and say i was thinking on thy goodness of overnight wouldst have wedded me to the tete dor or rather to the tete de veau doree and left thyself solitary oh are ye there lad said denys recovering his good humour in a moment well but to speak sooth i meant that not for goodness but for friendship and true fellowship no more and let me tell you my young master my conscience it pricketh me even now for letting you turn your back thus on fortune and peaceful days a truer friend than i had taen and somewhat hamstrung thee then hadst thou been fain to lie smarting at the tete dor a month or so yon skittish lass had nursed thee tenderly and all had been well blade i had in hand to dot but remembering how thou hatest pain though it be but a scratch my craven heart it failed me at the pinch and denys wore a look of humble apology for his lack of virtuous resolution when the path of duty lay so clear gerard raised his eyebrows with astonishment at this monstrous but thoroughly characteristic revelation however this new and delicate point of friendship was never discussed viz whether one ought in all love to cut the tendon achilles of ones friend for an incident interposed here cometh one in our rear ariding on his neighbours mule shouted denys gerard turned round and how know ye tis not his own pray oh blind because he rides it with no discretion and in truth the man came galloping like a fury but what astonished the friends most was that on reaching them the rustic riders eyes opened saucerlike and he drew the rein so suddenly and powerfully that the mule stuck out her forelegs and went sliding between the pedestrians like a fourlegged table on castors i trow ye are from the tete dor they assented which of ye is the younger he that was born the later said denys winking at his companion gramercy for the news come divine then and shall thy beard is ripe thy fellows is green he shall be the younger here youngster and he held him out a paper packet ye left this at the tete dor and our mistress sends it ye nay good fellow methinks i left nought and gerard felt his pouch etc would ye make our burgess a liar said the rustic reproachfully and shall i have no pourboire still more reproachfully and came ventre a terre nay thou shalt have pourboire and he gave him a small coin a la bonne heure cried the clown and his features beamed with disproportionate joy the virgin go with ye come up jenny and back he went stomach to earth as his nation is pleased to call it gerard undid the packet it was about six inches square and inside it he found another packet which contained a packet and so on at the fourth he hurled the whole thing into the snow denys took it out and rebuked his petulance he excused himself on the ground of hating affectation denys attested the great toe of the little daughter of herodias there was no affectation here but only womans good wit doubtless the wraps contained something which out of delicacy or her sexs lovely cunning she would not her hind should see her bestow on a young man thy garter to wit i wear none her own then or a lock of her hair what is this a piece of raw silk fresh from the worm well of all the love tokens now who but thee ever dreamed that she is so naught as send me love tokens i saw no harm in herbarring her hands stay here is something hard lurking in this soft nest come forth i say little nestling saints and pikestaves look at this it was a gold ring with a great amethyst glowing and sparkling full coloured but pure as crystal how lovely said gerard innocently and here is something writ read it thou i read not so glib as some when i know not the matter beforehand gerard took the paper tis a posy and fairly enough writ he read the lines blushing like a girl they were very naive and may be thus englished youth with thee my heart is fledde come back to the golden hedde wilt not yet this token keepe of hir who doeth thy goeing weepe gyf the world prove harsh and cold come back to the hedde of gold the little dove purred denys the great owl to go and risk her good name thus however thank heaven she has played this prank with an honest lad that will neer expose her folly but oh the perverseness could she not bestow her nauseousness on thee denys sighed and shrugged on thee that art as ripe for folly as herself denys confessed that his young friend had harped his very thought twas passing strange to him that a damsel with eyes in her head should pass by a man and bestow her affections on a boy still he could not but recognize in this the bounty of nature boys were human beings after all and but for this occasional caprice of women their lot would be too terrible they would be out of the sun altogether blighted and never come to anything since only the fair could make a man out of such unpromising materials as a boy gerard interrupted this flattering discourse to beg the warriorphilosophers acceptance of the ladys ring he refused it flatly and insisted on gerard going back to the tete dor at once ring and all like a man and not letting a poor girl hold out her arms to him in vain her hands you mean her hand with the tete dor in it failing in this he was for putting the ring on his friends finger gerard declined i wear a ring already what that sorry gimcrack why tis pewter or tin at best and this virgin gold forbye the jewel ay but twas margaret gave me this one and i value it above rubies ill neither part with it nor give it a rival and he kissed the base metal and bade it fear nought i see the owl hath sent her ring to a goose said denys sorrowfully however he prevailed on gerard to fasten it inside his bonnet to this indeed the lad consented very readily for sovereign qualities were universally ascribed to certain jewels and the amethyst ranked high among these precious talismans when this was disposed of gerard earnestly requested his friend to let the matter drop since speaking of the other sex to him made him pine so for margaret and almost unmanned him with the thought that each step was taking him farther from her i am no general lover denys there is room in my heart for one sweetheart and for one friend i am far from my dear mistress and my friend a few leagues more and i must lose him too oh let me drink thy friendship pure while i may and not dilute with any of these stupid females and shalt honeypot and shalt said denys kindly but as to my leaving thee at remiremont reckon thou not on that for three consecutive oaths if i do nay i shall propose to thee to stay fortyeight hours there while i kiss my mother and sisters and the females generally and on go you and i together to the sea denys denys denys nor me tis settled gainsay me not or ill go with thee to rome why not his holiness the pope hath ever some little merry pleasant war toward and a burgundian soldier is still welcome in his ranks on this gerard opened his heart denys ere i fell in with thee i used often to halt on the road unable to go farther my puny heart so pulled me back and then after a short prayer to the saints for aid would i rise and drag my most unwilling body onward but since i joined company with thee great is my courage i have found the saying of the ancients true that better is a bright comrade on the weary road than a horselitter and dear brother when i do think of what we have done and suffered together savedst my life from the bear and from yet more savage thieves and even poor i did make shift to draw thee out of rhine and somehow loved thee double from that hour how many ties tender and strong between us had i my will id never never never never part with my denys on this side the grave welladay god his will be done no my will shall be done this time shouted denys le bon dieu has bigger fish to fry than you or me ill go with thee to rome there is my hand on it think what you say tis impossible tis too selfish of me i tell thee tis settled no power can change me at remiremont i borrow ten pieces of my uncle and on we go tis fixed they shook hands over it then gerard said nothing for his heart was too full but he ran twice round his companion as he walked then danced backwards in front of him and finally took his hand and so on they went hand in hand like sweethearts till a company of mounted soldiers about fifty in number rose to sight on the brow of a hill see the banner of burgundy said denys joyfully i shall look out for a comrade among these how gorgeous is the standard in the sun said gerard and how brave are the leaders with velvet and feathers and steel breastplates like glassy mirrors when they came near enough to distinguish faces denys uttered an exclamation why tis the bastard of burgundy as i live nay then there is fighting afoot since he is out a gallant leader gerard rates his life no higher than a private soldiers and a soldiers no higher than a tomtits and that is the captain for me and see denys the very mules with their great brass frontlets and trappings seem proud to carry them no wonder men itch to be soldiers and in the midst of this innocent admiration the troop came up with them halt cried a stentorian voice the troop halted the bastard of burgundy bent his brow gloomily on denys how now arbalestrier how comes it thy face is turned southward when every good hand and heart is hurrying northward denys replied respectfully that he was going on leave after some years of service to see his kindred at remiremont good but this is not the time fort the duchy is disturbed ho bring that dead soldiers mule to the front and thou mount her and forward with us to flanders so please your highness said denys firmly that may not be my home is close at hand i have not seen it these three years and above all i have this poor youth in charge whom i may not cannot leave till i see him shipped for rome dost bandy words with me said the chief with amazement turning fast to wrath art weary o thy life let go the youths hand and into the saddle without more idle words denys made no reply but he held gerards hand the tighter and looked defiance at this the bastard roared jarnac dismount six of thy archers and shoot me this whitelivered cur dead where he standsfor an example the young count de jarnac second in command gave the order and the men dismounted to execute it strip him naked said the bastard in the cold tone of military business and put his arms and accoutrements on the spare mule well maybe find some clown worthier to wear them denys groaned aloud am i to be shamed as well as slain oh nay nay nay cried gerard awaking from the stupor into which this thunderbolt of tyranny had thrown him he shall go with you on the instant id liever part with him for ever than see a hair of his dear head harmed oh sir oh my lord give a poor boy but a minute to bid his only friend farewell he will go with you i swear he shall go with you the stern leader nodded a cold contemptuous assent thou jarnac stay with them and bring him on alive or dead forward and he resumed his march followed by all the band but the young count and six archers one of whom held the spare mule denys and gerard gazed at one another haggardly oh what a look and after this mute interchange of anguish they spoke hurriedly for the moments were flying by thou goest to holland thou knowest where she bides tell her all she will be kind to thee for my sake oh sorry tale that i shall carry her for gods sake go back to the tete dor i am mad hush let me think have i nought to say to thee denys my head my head ah i have it make for the rhine gerard strasbourg tis but a step and down the current to rotterdam margaret is there i go thither ill tell her thou art coming we shall all be together my lads haste ye or you will get us into trouble said the count firmly but not harshly now oh sir one moment one little moment panted gerard cursed be the land i was born in cursed be the race of man and he that made them what they are screamed denys hush denys hush blaspheme not oh god forgive him he wots not what he says be patient denys be patient though we meet no more on earth let us meet in a better world where no blasphemer may enter to my heart lost friend for what are words now he held out his arms and they locked one another in a close embrace they kissed one another again and again speechless and the tears rained down their cheeks and the count jarnac looked on amazed but the rougher soldiers to whom comrade was a sacred name looked on with some pity in their hard faces then at a signal from jarnac with kind force and words of rude consolation they almost lifted denys on to the mule and putting him in the middle of them spurred after their leader and gerard ran wildly after for the lane turned to see the very last of him and the last glimpse he caught denys was rocking to and fro on his mule and tearing his hair out but at this sight something rose in gerards throat so high so high he could run no more nor breathe but gasped and leaned against the snowclad hedge seizing it and choking piteously the thorns ran into his hand after a bitter struggle he got his breath again and now began to see his own misfortune yet not all at once to realize it so sudden and numbing was the stroke he staggered on but scarce feeling or caring whither he was going and every now and then he stopped and his arms fell and his head sank on his chest and he stood motionless then he said to himself can this thing be this must be a dream tis scarce five minutes since we were so happy walking handed faring to rome together and we admired them and their gay banners and helmets oh hearts of hell all nature seemed to stare now as lonely as himself not a creature in sight no colour but white he the ghost of his former self wandered alone among the ghosts of trees and fields and hedges desolate desolate desolate all was desolate he knelt and gathered a little snow nay i dream not for this is snow cold as the worlds heart it is bloody too what may that mean fool tis from thy hand i mind not the wound ay i see thorns welcome kindly foes i felt ye not ye ran not into my heart ye are not cruel like men he had risen and was dragging his leaden limbs along when he heard horses feet and gay voices behind him he turned with a joyful but wild hope that the soldiers had relented and were bringing denys back but no it was a gay cavalcade a gentleman of rank and his favourites in velvet and furs and feathers and four or five armed retainers in buff jerkins they swept gaily by gerard never looked at them after they were gone by certain gay shadows had come and passed that was all he was like one in a dream but he was rudely wakened suddenly a voice in front of him cried harshly stand and deliver and there were three of the gentlemans servants in front of him they had ridden back to rob him how ye false knaves said he quite calmly would ye shame your noble master he will hang ye to the nearest tree and with these words he drew his sword doggedly and set his back to the hedge one of the men instantly levelled his petronel at him but another less sanguinary interposed be not so hasty and be not thou so mad look yonder gerard looked and scarce a hundred yards off the nobleman and his friends had halted and sat on their horses looking at the lawless act too proud to do their own dirty work but not too proud to reap the fruit and watch lest their agents should rob them of another mans money the milder servant then a goodnatured fellow showed gerard resistance was vain reminded him common thieves often took the life as well as the purse and assured him it cost a mint to be a gentleman his master had lost money at play overnight and was going to visit his leman and so must take money where he saw it therefore good youth consider that we rob not for ourselves and deliver us that fat purse at thy girdle without more ado nor put us to the pain of slitting thy throat and taking it all the same this knave is right said gerard calmly aloud but to himself i ought not to fling away my life margaret would be so sorry take then the poor mans purse to the rich mans pouch and with it this tell him i pray the holy trinity each coin in it may burn his hand and freeze his heart and blast his soul for ever begone and leave me to my sorrow he flung them the purse they rode away muttering for his words pricked them a little a very little and he staggered on penniless now as well as friendless till he came to the edge of a wood then though his heart could hardly feel this second blow his judgment did and he began to ask himself what was the use going further he sat down on the hard road and ran his nails into his hair and tried to think for the best a task all the more difficult that a strange drowsiness was stealing over him rome he could never reach without money denys had said go to strasbourg and down the rhine home he would obey denys but how to get to strasbourg without money then suddenly seemed to ring in his ears gyf the world prove harsh and cold come back to the hedde of gold and if i do i must go as her servant i who am margarets i am aweary aweary i will sleep and dream all is as it was ah me how happy were we an hour agone we little knew how happy there is a house the owner welltodo what if i told him my wrong and prayed his aid to retrieve my purse and so to rhine fool is he not a man like the rest he would scorn me and trample me lower denys cursed the race of men that will i never but oh i begin to loathe and dread them nay here will i lie till sunset then darkling creep into this rich mans barn and take by stealth a draught of milk or a handful o grain to keep body and soul together god who hath seen the rich rob me will peradventure forgive me they say tis ill sleeping on the snow death steals on such sleepers with muffled feet and honey breath but what can i i am aweary aweary shall this be the wood where lie the wolves yon old man spoke of i must een trust them they are not men and i am so aweary he crawled to the roadside and stretched out his limbs on the snow with a deep sigh ah tear not thine hair so teareth my heart to see thee margaret never see me more poor margaret and the too tender heart was still and the constant lover and friend of antique mould lay silent on the snow in peril from the weather in peril from wild beasts in peril from hunger friendless and penniless in a strange land and not halfway to rome chapter xxxix rude travel is enticing to us english and so are its records even though the adventurer be no pilgrim of love and antique friendship has at least the interest of a fossil still as the true centre of this story is in holland it is full time to return thither and to those ordinary personages and incidents whereof life has been mainly composed in all ages jorian ketel came to peters house to claim margarets promise but margaret was ill in bed and peter on hearing his errand affronted him and warned him off the premises and one or two that stood by were for ducking him for both father and daughter were favourites and the whole story was in every mouth and sevenbergens in that state of hot undiscriminating irritation which accompanies popular sympathy so jorian ketel went off in dudgeon and repented him of his good deed this sort of penitence is not rare and has the merit of being sincere dierich brower who was discovered at the three kings making a chatterbox drunk in order to worm out of him the whereabouts of martin wittenhaagen was actually taken and flung into a horsepond and threatened with worse usage should he ever show his face in the burgh again and finally municipal jealousy being roused the burgomaster of sevenbergen sent a formal missive to the burgomaster of tergou reminding him he had overstepped the law and requesting him to apply to the authorities of sevenbergen on any future occasion when he might have a complaint real or imaginary against any of its townsfolk the wily ghysbrecht suppressing his rage at this remonstrance sent back a civil message to say that the person he had followed to sevenbergen was a tergovian one gerard and that he had stolen the town records that gerard having escaped into foreign parts and probably taken the documents with him the whole matter was at an end thus he made a virtue of necessity but in reality his calmness was but a veil baffled at sevenbergen he turned his views elsewhere he set his emissaries to learn from the family at tergou whither gerard had fled and to his infinite surprise they did not know this added to his uneasiness it made him fear gerard was only lurking in the neighbourhood he would make a certain discovery and would come back and take a terrible revenge from this time dierich and others that were about him noticed a change for the worse in ghysbrecht van swieten he became a moody irritable man a dread lay on him his eyes cast furtive glances like one who expects a blow and knows not from what quarter it is to come making others wretched had not made him happy it seldom does the little family at tergou which but for his violent interference might in time have cemented its difference without banishing spem gregis to a distant land wore still the same outward features but within was no longer the simple happy family this tale opened with little kate knew the share cornelis and sybrandt had in banishing gerard and though for fear of making more mischief still she never told her mother yet there were times she shuddered at the bare sight of them and blushed at their hypocritical regrets catherine with a womans vigilance noticed this and with a womans subtlety said nothing but quietly pondered it and went on watching for more the black sheep themselves in their efforts to partake in the general gloom and sorrow succeeded so far as to impose upon their father and giles but the demure satisfaction that lay at their bottom could not escape these feminine eyes that noting all seem nought to note thus mistrust and suspicion sat at the table poor substitutes for gerards intelligent face that had brightened the whole circle unobserved till it was gone as for the old hosier his pride had been wounded by his sons disobedience and so he bore stiffly up and did his best never to mention gerards name but underneath his spartan cloak nature might be seen tugging at his heartstrings one anxiety he never affected to conceal if i but knew where the boy is and that his life and health are in no danger small would be my care would he say and then a deep sigh would follow i cannot help thinking that if gerard had opened the door just then and walked in there would have been many tears and embraces for him and few reproaches or none one thing took the old couple quite by surprisepublicity ere gerard had been gone a week his adventures were in every mouth and to make matters worse the popular sympathy declared itself warmly on the side of the lovers and against gerards cruel parents and that old busybody the burgomaster who must put his nose into a business that nowise concerned him mother said kate it is all over the town that margaret is down with a fevera burning fever her father fears her sadly margaret what margaret inquired catherine with a treacherous assumption of calmness and indifference oh mother whom should i mean why gerards margaret gerards margaret screamed catherine how dare you say such a word to me and i rede you never mention that hussys name in this house that she has laid bare she is the ruin of my poor boy the flower of all my flock she is the cause that he is not a holy priest in the midst of us but is roaming the world and i a desolate brokenhearted mother there do not cry my girl i do ill to speak harsh to you but oh kate you know not what passes in a mothers heart i bear up before you all it behoves me swallow my fears but at night i see him in my dreams and still some trouble or other near him sometimes he is torn by wild beasts other times he is in the hands of robbers and their cruel knives uplifted to strike his poor pale face that one should think would move a stone oh when i remember that while i sit here in comfort perhaps my poor boy lies dead in some savage place and all along of that girl there her very name is ratsbane to me i tremble all over when i hear it ill not say anything nor do anything to grieve you worse mother said kate tenderly but she sighed she whose name was so fiercely interdicted in this house was much spoken of and even pitied elsewhere all sevenbergen was sorry for her and the young men and maidens cast many a pitying glance as they passed at the little window where the beauty of the village lay dying for love in this familiar phrase they underrated her spirit and unselfishness gerard was not dead and she was too loyal herself to doubt his constancy her father was dear to her and helpless and but for bodily weakness all her love for gerard would not have kept her from doing her duties though she might have gone about them with drooping head and heavy heart but physical and mental excitement had brought on an attack of fever so violent that nothing but youth and constitution saved her the malady left her at last but in that terrible state of bodily weakness in which the patient feels life a burden then it is that love and friendship by the bedside are mortal angels with comfort in their voice and healing in their palms but this poor girl had to come back to life and vigour how she could many days she lay alone and the heavy hours rolled like leaden waves over her in her enfeebled state existence seemed a burden and life a thing gone by she could not try her best to get well gerard was gone she had not him to get well for often she lay for hours quite still with the tears welling gently out of her eyes one day waking from an uneasy slumber she found two women in her room one was a servant the other by the deep fur on her collar and sleeves was a person of consideration a narrow band of silvery hair being spared by her coiffure showed her to be past the age when women of sense concealed their years the looks of both were kind and friendly margaret tried to raise herself in the bed but the old lady placed a hand very gently on her lie still sweetheart we come not here to put you about but to comfort you god willing now cheer up a bit and tell us first who think you we are nay madam i know you though i never saw you before you are the demoiselle van eyck and this is reicht heynes gerard has oft spoken of you and of your goodness to him madam he has no friend like you near him now and at this thought she lay back and the tears welled out of her eyes in a moment the goodnatured reicht heynes began to cry for company but her mistress scolded her well you are a pretty one for a sickroom said she and she put out a world of innocent art to cheer the patient and not without some little success an old woman that has seen life and all its troubles is a sovereign blessing by a sorrowful young womans side she knows what to say and what to avoid she knows how to soothe her and interest her ere she had been there an hour she had margarets head lying on her shoulder instead of on the pillow and margarets soft eyes dwelling on her with gentle gratitude ah this is hair said the old lady running her fingers through it come and look at it reicht reicht came and handled it and praised it unaffectedly the poor girl that owned it was not quite out of the reach of flattery owing doubtless to not being dead in sooth madam i did use to think it hideous but he praised it and ever since then i have been almost vain of it saints forgive me you know how foolish those are that love they are greater fools that dont said the old lady sharply margaret opened her lovely eyes and looked at her for her meaning this was only the first of many visits in fact either margaret van eyck or reicht came nearly every day until their patient was convalescent and she improved rapidly under their hands reicht attributed this principally to certain nourishing dishes she prepared in peters kitchen but margaret herself thought more of the kind words and eyes that kept telling her she had friends to live for martin wittenhaagen went straight to rotterdam to take the bull by the horns the bull was a biped with a crown for horns it was philip the good duke of this earl of that lord of the other arrived at rotterdam martin found the court was at ghent to ghent he went and sought an audience but was put off and baffled by lackeys and pages so he threw himself in his sovereigns way out hunting and contrary to all court precedents commenced the conversationby roaring lustily for mercy why where is the peril man said the duke looking all round and laughing grace for an old soldier hunted down by burghers now kings differ in character like other folk but there is one trait they have in common they are mightily inclined to be affable to men of very low estate these do not vie with them in anything whatever so jealousy cannot creep in and they amuse them by their bluntness and novelty and refresh the poor things with a touch of naturea rarity in courts so philip the good reined in his horse and gave martin almost a teteatete and martin reminded him of a certain battlefield where he had received an arrow intended for his sovereign the duke remembered the incident perfectly and was graciously pleased to take a cheerful view of it he could afford to not having been the one hit then martin told his majesty of gerards first capture in the church his imprisonment in the tower and the manoeuvre by which they got him out and all the details of the hunt and whether he told it better than i have or the duke had not heard so many good stories as you have certain it is that sovereign got so wrapt up in it that when a number of courtiers came galloping up and interrupted martin he swore like a costermonger and threatened only half in jest to cut off the next head that should come between him and a good story and when martin had done he cried out st luke what sport goeth on in this mine earldom ay in my own woods and i see it not you base fellows have all the luck and he was indignant at the partiality of fortune lo you now this was a manhunt said he i never had the luck to be at a manhunt my luck was none so great replied martin bluntly i was on the wrong side of the dogs noses ah so you were i forgot that and royalty was more reconciled to its lot what would you then a free pardon your highness for myself and gerard for what for prisonbreaking go to the bird will fly from the cage tis instinct besides coop a young man up for loving a young woman these burgomasters must be void of common sense what else for striking down the burgomaster oh the hunted boar will turn to bay tis his right and i hold him less than man that grudges it him what else for killing of the bloodhounds the dukes countenance fell twas their life or mine said martin eagerly ay but i cant have my bloodhounds my beautiful bloodhounds sacrificed to no no no they were not your dogs whose dogs then the rangers oh well i am very sorry for him but as i was saying i cant have my old soldiers sacrificed to his bloodhounds thou shalt have thy free pardon and poor gerard and poor gerard too for thy sake and more tell thou this burgomaster his doings mislike me this is to set up for a king not a burgomaster ill have no kings in holland but one bid him be more humble or by st jude ill hang him before his own door as i hanged the burgomaster of whats the name some town or other in flanders it was no twas somewhere in brabantno matteri hanged him i remember that muchfor oppressing poor folk the duke then beckoned his chancellor a pursy old fellow that rode like a sack and bade him write out a free pardon for martin and one gerard this precious document was drawn up in form and signed next day and martin hastened home with it margaret had left her bed some days and was sitting pale and pensive by the fireside when he burst in waving the parchment and crying a free pardon girl for gerard as well as me send for him back when you will all the burgomasters on earth darent lay a finger on him she flushed all over with joy and her hands trembled with eagerness as she took the parchment and devoured it with her eyes and kissed it again and again and flung her arms round martins neck and kissed him when she was calmer she told him heaven had raised her up a friend in the dame van eyck and i would fain consult her on this good news but i have not strength to walk so far what need to walk there is my mule your mule martin the old soldier or professional pillager laughed and confessed he had got so used to her that he forgot at times ghysbrecht had a prior claim tomorrow he would turn her into the burgomasters yard but tonight she should carry margaret to tergou it was nearly dusk so margaret ventured and about seven in the evening she astonished and gladdened her new but ardent friend by arriving at her house with unwonted roses on her cheeks and gerards pardon in her bosom chapter xl some are old in heart at forty some are young at eighty margaret van eycks heart was an evergreen she loved her young namesake with youthful ardour nor was this new sentiment a mere caprice she was quick at reading character and saw in margaret brandt that which in one of her own sex goes far with an intelligent woman genuineness but besides her own sterling qualities margaret had from the first a potent ally in the old artists bosom human nature strange as it may appear to the unobservant our hearts warm more readily to those we have benefited than to our benefactors some of the greek philosophers noticed this but the british homer has stamped it in immortal lines i heard and thought how side by side we two had stemmed the battles tide in many a welldebated field where bertrams breast was philips shield i thought on dariens deserts pale where death bestrides the evening gale how oer my friend my cloak i threw and fenceless faced the deadly dew i thought on quarianas cliff where rescued from our foundering skiff through the white breakers wrath i bore exhausted bertram to the shore and when his side an arrow found i sucked the indians venomd wound these thoughts like torrents rushed along to sweep away my purpose strong observe this assassins hand is stayed by memory not of benefits received but benefits conferred now margaret van eyck had been wonderfully kind to margaret brandt had broken through her own habits to go and see her had nursed her and soothed her and petted her and cured her more than all the medicine in the world so her heart opened to the recipient of her goodness and she loved her now far more tenderly than she had ever loved gerard though in truth it was purely out of regard for gerard she had visited her in the first instance when therefore she saw the roses on margarets cheek and read the bit of parchment that had brought them there she gave up her own views without a murmur sweetheart said she i did desire he should stay in italy five or six years and come back rich and above all an artist but your happiness is before all and i see you cannot live without him so we must have him home as fast as may be ah madam you see my very thoughts and the young woman hung her head a moment and blushed but how to let him know madam that passes my skill he is gone to italy but what part i know not stay he named the cities he should visit florence was one and rome but thenfinally being a sensible girl she divined that a letter addressed my gerarditaly might chance to miscarry and she looked imploringly at her friend for counsel you are come to the right place and at the right time said the old lady here was this hans memling with me today he is going to italy girl no later than next week to improve his hand he says not before twas needed i do assure you but how is he to find my gerard why he knows your gerard child they have supped here more than once and were like hand and glove now as his business is the same as gerards he will visit the same places as gerard and soon or late he must fall in with him wherefore get you a long letter written and copy out this pardon into it and ill answer for the messenger in six months at farthest gerard shall get it and when he shall get it then will he kiss it and put it in his bosom and come flying home what are you smiling at and now what makes your cheeks so red and what you are smothering me for i cannot think yes happy days are coming to my little pearl meantime martin sat in the kitchen with the blackjack before him and reicht heynes spinning beside him and wow but she pumped him that night this hans memling was an old pupil of jan van eyck and his sister he was a painter notwithstanding margarets sneer and a good soul enough with one fault he loved the nipperkin canakin and the brown bowl more than they deserve this singular penchant kept him from amassing fortune and was the cause that he often came to margaret van eyck for a meal and sometimes for a groat but this gave her a claim on him and she knew he would not trifle with any commission she should entrust to him the letter was duly written and left with margaret van eyck and the following week sure enough hans memling returned from flanders margaret van eyck gave him the letter and a piece of gold towards his travelling expenses he seemed in a hurry to be off all the better said the old artist he will be the sooner in italy but as there are horses who burn and rage to start and after the first yard or two want the whip so all this hurry cooled into inaction when hans got as far as the principal hostelry of tergou and saw two of his boon companions sitting in the bay window he went in for a parting glass with them but when he offered to pay they would not hear of it no he was going a long journey they would treat him everybody must treat him the landlord and all it resulted from this treatment that his tongue got as loose as if the wine had been oil and he confided to the convivial crew that he was going to show the italians how to paint next he sang his exploits in battle for he had handled a pike and his amorous successes with females not present to oppose their version of the incidents in short plenus rimarum erat huc illuc diffluebat and among the miscellaneous matters that oozed out he must blab that he was entrusted with a letter to a townsman of theirs one gerard a good fellow he added you are all good fellows and to impress his eulogy slapped sybrandt on the back so heartily as to drive the breath out of his body sybrandt got round the table to avoid this muscular approval but listened to every word and learned for the first time that gerard was gone to italy however to make sure he affected to doubt it my brother gerard is never in italy ye lie ye cur roared hans taking instantly the irascible turn and not being clear enough to see that he who now sat opposite him was the same he had praised and hit when beside him if he is ten times your brother he is in italy what call ye this there read me that superscription and he flung down a letter on the table sybrandt took it up and examined it gravely but eventually laid it down with the remark that he could not read however one of the company by some immense fortuity could read and proud of so rare an accomplishment took it and read it out to gerard eliassoen of tergou these by the hand of the trusty hans memling with all speed tis excellently well writ said the reader examining every letter ay said hans bombastically and small wonder tis writ by a famous hand by margaret sister of jan van eyck blessed and honoured be his memory she is an old friend of mine is margaret van eyck miscellaneous hans then diverged into forty topics sybrandt stole out of the company and went in search of cornelis they put their heads together over the news italy was an immense distance off if they could only keep him there keep him there nothing would keep him long from his margaret curse her said sybrandt why didnt she die when she was about it she die she would outlive the pest to vex us and cornelis was wroth at her selfishness in not dying to oblige these two black sheep kept putting their heads together and tainting each other worse and worse till at last their corrupt hearts conceived a plan for keeping gerard in italy all his life and so securing his share of their fathers substance but when they had planned it they were no nearer the execution for that required talent so iniquity came to a standstill but presently as if satan had come between the two heads and whispered into the right ear of one and the left of the other simultaneously they both burst out the burgomaster they went to ghysbrecht van swieten and he received them at once for the man who is under the torture of suspense catches eagerly at knowledge certainty is often painful but seldom like suspense intolerable you have news of gerard said he eagerly then they told about the letter and hans memling he listened with restless eye who writ the letter margaret van eyck was the reply for they naturally thought the contents were by the same hand as the superscription are ye sure and he went to a drawer and drew out a paper written by margaret van eyck while treating with the burgh for her house was it writ like this yes tis the same writing said sybrandt boldly good and now what would ye of me said ghysbrecht with beating heart but a carelessness so well feigned that it staggered them they fumbled with their bonnets and stammered and spoke a word or two then hesitated and beat about the bush and let out by degrees that they wanted a letter written to say something that might keep gerard in italy and this letter they proposed to substitute in hans memlings wallet for the one he carried while these fumbled with their bonnets and their iniquity and vacillated between respect for a burgomaster and suspicion that this one was as great a rogue as themselves and somehow or other on their side against gerard pros and cons were coursing one another to and fro in the keen old mans spirit vengeance said let gerard come back and feel the weight of the law prudence said keep him a thousand miles off but then prudence said also why do dirty work on a doubtful chance why put it in the power of these two rogues to tarnish your name finally his strong persuasion that gerard was in possession of a secret by means of which he could wound him to the quick coupled with his caution found words thus it is my duty to aid the citizens that cannot write but for their matter i will not be responsible tell me then what i shall write something about this margaret ay ay that she is false that she is married to another ill go bail nay burgomaster nay not for all the world cried sybrandt gerard would not believe it or but half and then he would come back to see no say that she is dead dead what at her age will he credit that sooner than the other why she was nearly dead so it is not to say a downright lie after all humph and you think that will keep him in italy we are sure of it are we not cornelis ay said cornelis our gerard will never leave italy now he is there it was always his dream to get there he would come back for his margaret but not for us what cares he for us he despises his own family always did this would be a bitter pill to him said the old hypocrite it will be for his good in the end replied the young one what avails famine wedding thirst said cornelis and the grief you are preparing for him so coolly ghysbrecht spoke sarcastically but tasted his own vengeance all the time oh a lie is not like a blow with a curtal axe it hacks no flesh and breaks no bones a curtal axe said sybrandt no nor even like a stroke with a cudgel and he shot a sly envenomed glance at the burgomasters broken nose ghysbrechts face darkened with ire when this adders tongue struck his wound but it told as intended the old man bristled with hate well said he tell me what to write for you and i must write it but take notice you bear the blame if aught turns amiss not the hand which writes but the tongue which dictates doth the deed the brothers assented warmly sneering within ghysbrecht then drew his inkhorn towards him and laid the specimen of margaret van eycks writing before him and made some inquiries as to the size and shape of the letter when an unlookedfor interruption occurred jorian ketel burst hastily into the room and looked vexed at not finding him alone thou seest i have matter on hand good fellow ay but this is grave i bring good news but tis not for every ear the burgomaster rose and drew jorian aside into the embrasure of his deep window and then the brothers heard them converse in low but eager tones it ended by ghysbrecht sending jorian out to saddle his mule he then addressed the black sheep with a sudden coldness that amazed them i prize the peace of households but this is not a thing to be done in a hurry we will see about it we will see but burgomaster the man will be gone it will be too late where is he at the hostelry drinking well keep him drinking we will see we will see and he sent them off discomfited to explain all this we must retrograde a step this very morning then margaret brandt had met jorian ketel near her own door he passed her with a scowl this struck her and she remembered him stay said she yes it is the good man who saved him oh why have you not been near me since and why have you not come for the parchments was it not true about the hundred crowns jorian gave a snort but seeing her face that looked so candid began to think there might be some mistake he told her he had come and how he had been received alas said she i knew nought of this i lay at deaths door she then invited him to follow her and took him into the garden and showed him the spot where the parchments were buried martin was for taking them up but i would not let him he put them there and i said none should move them but you who had earned them so well of him and me give me a spade cried jorian eagerly but stay no he is a suspicious man you are sure they are there still i will openly take the blame if human hand hath touched them then keep them but two hours more i prithee good margaret said jorian and ran off to the stadthouse of tergou a joyful man the burgomaster jogged along towards sevenbergen with jorian striding beside him giving him assurance that in an hours time the missing parchments would be in his hand ah master said he lucky for us it wasnt a thief that took them not a thief not a thief what call you him then well saving your presence i call him a jackdaw this is jackdaws work if ever there was take the thing you are least in need of and hide itthats a jackdaw i should know added jorian oracularly for i was brought up along with a chough he and i were born the same year but he cut his teeth long before me and wow but my life was a burden for years all along of him if you had but a hole in your hose no bigger than a groat in went his beak like a gimlet and for stealing gerard all over what he wanted least and any poor christian in the house wanted most that went first mother was a notable woman so if she did but look round away flew her thimble father lived by cordwaining so about sunrise jack went diligently off with his awl his wax and his twine after that make your bread how you could one day i heard my mother tell him to his face he was enough to corrupt halfadozen other children and he only cocked his eye at her and next minute away with the nurselings shoe off his very foot now this gerard is tarred with the same stick the parchments are no more use to him than a thimble or an awl to jack he took em out of pure mischief and hid them and you would never have found them but for me i believe you are right said ghysbrecht and i have vexed myself more than need when they came to peters gate he felt uneasy i wish it had been anywhere but here jorian reassured him the girl is honest and friendly said he she had nothing to do with taking them ill be sworn and he led him into the garden there master if a face is to be believed here they lie and see the mould is loose he ran for a spade which was stuck up in the ground at some distance and soon went to work and uncovered a parchment ghysbrecht saw it and thrust him aside and went down on his knees and tore it out of the hole his hands trembled and his face shone he threw out parchment after parchment and jorian dusted them and cleared them and shook them now when ghysbrecht had thrown out a great many his face began to darken and lengthen and when he came to the last he put his hands to his temples and seemed to be all amazed what mystery lies here he gasped are fiends mocking me dig deeper there must be another jorian drove the spade in and threw out quantities of hard mould in vain and even while he dug his masters mood had changed treason treachery he cried you knew of this knew what master in heavens name caitiff you knew there was another one worth all these twice told tis false cried jorian made suspicious by the others suspicion tis a trick to rob me of my hundred crowns oh i know you burgomaster and jorian was ready to whimper a mellow voice fell on them both like oil upon the waves no good man it is not false nor yet is it quite true there was another parchment there there there where is it but continued margaret calmly it was not a town record so you have gained your hundred crowns good man it was but a private deed between the burgomaster here and my grandfather flor hush hush is brandt where is it girl that is all we want to know have patience and i shall tell you gerard read the title of it and he said this is as much yours as the burgomasters and he put it apart to read it with me at his leisure it is in the house then said the burgomaster recovering his calmness no sir said margaret gravely it is not then in a voice that faltered suddenly you huntedmy poor gerardso hardand so closethat you gave himno timeto think of aughtbut his lifeand his grief the parchment was in his bosom and he hath taen it with him whither whither ask me no more sir what right is yours to question me thus it was for your sake good man i put force upon my heart and came out here and bore to speak at all to this hard old man for when i think of the misery he has brought on him and me the sight of him is more than i can bear and she gave an involuntary shudder and went slowly in with her hand to her head crying bitterly remorse for the past and dread of the futurethe slow but as he now felt the inevitable futureavarice and fear all tugged in one short moment at ghysbrechts tough heart he hung his head and his arms fell listless by his sides a coarse chuckle made him start round and there stood martin wittenhaagen leaning on his bow and sneering from ear to ear at sight of the man and his grinning face ghysbrechts worst passions awoke ho attach him seize him traitor and thief cried he dog thou shalt pay for all martin without a word calmly thrust the dukes pardon under ghysbrechts nose he looked and had not a word to say martin followed up his advantage the duke and i are soldiers he wont let you greasy burghers trample on an old comrade he bade me carry you a message too the duke send a message to me ay i told him of your masterful doings of your imprisoning gerard for loving a girl and says he tell him this is to be a king not a burgomaster ill have no kings in holland but one bid him be more humble or ill hang him at his own door ghysbrecht trembled he thought the duke capable of the deed as i hanged the burgomaster of thingembob the duke could not mind which of you he had hung or in what part such trifles stick not in a soldiers memory but he was sure he had hanged one of you for grinding poor folk and im the man to hang another quoth the good duke these repeated insults from so mean a man coupled with his invulnerability shielded as he was by the duke drove the choleric old man into a fit of impotent fury he shook his fist at the soldier and tried to threaten him but could not speak for the rage and mortification that choked him then he gave a sort of screech and coiled himself up in eye and form like a rattlesnake about to strike and spat furiously upon martins doublet the thickskinned soldier treated this ebullition with genuine contempt heres a venomous old toad he knows a kick from his foot would send him to his last home and he wants me to cheat the gallows but i have slain too many men in fair fight to lift limb against anything less than a man and this i count no man what is it in heavens name an old goatsskin bag full o rotten bones my mule my mule screamed ghysbrecht jorian helped the old man up trembling in every joint once in the saddle he seemed to gather in a moment unnatural vigour and the figure that went flying to tergou was truly weirdlike and terrible so old and wizened the face so white and reverend the streaming hair so baleful the eye so fierce the fury which shook the bent frame that went spurring like mad while the quavering voice yelled ill make their hearts ache ill make their hearts ache ill make their hearts ache ill make their hearts ache all of them allallall the black sheep sat disconsolate amidst the convivial crew and eyed hans memlings wallet for more ease he had taken it off and flung it on the table how readily they could have slipped out that letter and put in another for the first time in their lives they were sorry they had not learned to write like their brother and now hans began to talk of going and the brothers agreed in a whisper to abandon their project for the time they had scarcely resolved this when dierich brower stood suddenly in the doorway and gave them a wink they went out to him come to the burgomaster with all speed said he they found ghysbrecht seated at a table pale and agitated before him lay margaret van eycks handwriting i have written what you desired said he now for the superscription what were the words did ye see we cannot read said cornelis then is all this labour lost cried ghysbrecht angrily dolts nay but said sybrandt i heard the words read and i have not lost them they were to gerard eliassoen these by the hand of the trusty hans memling with all speed tis well now how was the letter folded how big was it longer than that one and not so long as this tis well where is he at the hostelry come then take you this groat and treat him then ask to see the letter and put this in place of it come to me with the other letter the brothers assented took the letter and went to the hostelry they had not been gone a minute when dierich brower issued from the stadthouse and followed them he had his orders not to let them out of his sight till the true letter was in his masters hands he watched outside the hostelry he had not long to wait they came out almost immediately with downcast looks dierich made up to them too late they cried too late he is gone gone how long scarce five minutes cursed chance you must go back to the burgomaster at once said dierich brower to what end no matter come and he hurried them to the stadthouse ghysbrecht van swieten was not the man to accept a defeat well said he on hearing the ill news suppose he is gone is he mounted no then what hinders you to come up with him but what avails coming up with him there are no hostelries on the road he is gone fools said ghysbrecht is there no way of emptying a mans pockets but liquor and sleight of hand a meaning look that passed between ghysbrecht and dierich aided the brothers comprehension they changed colour and lost all zeal for the business no no we dont hate our brother we wont get ourselves hanged to spite him said sybrandt that would be a fools trick hanged cried ghysbrecht am i not the burgomaster how can ye be hanged i see how tis ye fear to tackle one man being two hearts of hare that ye are oh why cannot i be young again id do it singlehanded the old man now threw off all disguise and showed them his heart was in this deed he then flattered and besought and jeered them alternately but he found no eloquence could move them to an action however dishonourable which was attended with danger at last he opened a drawer and showed them a pile of silver coins change but those letters for me he said and each of you shall thrust one hand into this drawer and take away as many of them as you can hold the effect was magical their eyes glittered with desire their whole bodies seemed to swell and rise into male energy swear it then said sybrandt i swear it no on the crucifix ghysbrecht swore upon the crucifix the next minute the brothers were on the road in pursuit of hans memling they came in sight of him about two leagues from tergou but though they knew he had no weapon but his staff they were too prudent to venture on him in daylight so they fell back but being now three leagues and more from the town and on a grassy roadsun down moon not yet uphonest hans suddenly found himself attacked before and behind at once by men with uplifted knives who cried in loud though somewhat shaky voices stand and deliver the attack was so sudden and so well planned that hans was dismayed slay me not good fellows he cried i am but a poor man and ye shall have my all so be it then live but empty thy wallet there is nought in my wallet good friend but one letter that we shall see said sybrandt who was the one in front well it is a letter take it not from me i pray you tis worth nought and the good dame would fret that writ it there said sybrandt take back thy letter and now empty thy pouch come i tarry not but by this time hans had recovered his confusion and from a certain flutter in sybrandt and hard breathing of cornelis aided by an indescribable consciousness felt sure the pair he had to deal with were no heroes he pretended to fumble for his money then suddenly thrust his staff fiercely into sybrandts face and drove him staggering and lent cornelis a backhanded slash on the ear that sent him twirling like a weathercock in march then whirled his weapon over his head and danced about the road like a figure on springs shouting come on ye thieving loons come on it was a plain invitation yet they misunderstood it so utterly as to take to their heels with hans after them he shouting stop thieves and they howling with fear and pain as they ran chapter xli denys placed in the middle of his companions lest he should be so mad as attempt escape was carried off in an agony of grief and remorse for his sake gerard had abandoned the german route to rome and what was his reward left all alone in the centre of burgundy this was the thought which maddened denys most and made him now rave at heaven and earth now fall into a gloomy silence so savage and sinister that it was deemed prudent to disarm him they caught up their leader just outside the town and the whole cavalcade drew up and baited at the tete dor the young landlady though much occupied with the count and still more with the bastard caught sight of denys and asked him somewhat anxiously what had become of his young companion denys with a burst of grief told her all and prayed her to send after gerard now he is parted from me he will maybe listen to my rede said he poor wretch he loves not solitude the landlady gave a toss of her head i trow i have been somewhat overkind already said she and turned rather red you will not not i thenand he poured a volley of curses and abuse upon her she turned her back upon him and went off whimpering and saying she was not used to be cursed at and ordered her hind to saddle two mules denys went north with his troop mute and drooping over his saddle and quite unknown to him that veracious young lady made an equestrian toilet in only forty minutes she being really in a hurry and spurred away with her servant in the opposite direction at dark after a long march the bastard and his men reached the white hart their arrival caused a prodigious bustle and it was some time before manon discovered her old friend among so many when she did she showed it only by heightened colour she did not claim the acquaintance the poor soul was already beginning to scorn the base degrees by which she did ascend denys saw but could not smile the inn reminded him too much of gerard ere the night closed the wind changed she looked into the room and beckoned him with her finger he rose sulkily and his guards with him nay i would speak a word to thee in private she drew him to a corner of the room and there asked him under her breath would he do her a kindness he answered out loud no he would not he was not in the vein to do kindnesses to man or woman if he did a kindness it should be to a dog and not that if he could help it alas good archer i did you one eftsoons you and your pretty comrade said manon humbly you did dame you did well then for his sakewhat ist to do thou knowest my story i had been unfortunate now i am worshipful but a woman did cast him in my teeth this day and so twill be ever while he hangs there i would have him taen down welladay with all my heart and none dare i ask but thee wilt dot not i even were i not a prisoner on this stern refusal the tender manon sighed and clasped her palms together despondently denys told her she need not fret there were soldiers of a lower stamp who would not make two bites of such a cherry it was a mere matter of money if she could find two angels he would find two soldiers to do the dirty work of the white hart this was not very palatable however reflecting that soldiers were birds of passage drinking here tonight knocked on the head there tomorrow she said softly send them out to me but prithee tell them that tis for one that is my friend let them not think tis for me i should sink into the earth times are changed denys found warriors glad to win an angel apiece so easily he sent them out and instantly dismissing the subject with contempt sat brooding on his lost friend manon and the warriors soon came to a general understanding but what were they to do with the body when taken down she murmured the river is nigh thethe place fling him in eh nay nay be not so cruel could ye not put himgentlyandwith somewhat weighty she must have been thinking on the subject in detail for she was not one to whom ideas came quickly all was speedily agreed except the time of payment the mailclad itched for it and sought it in advance manon demurred to that what did she doubt their word then let her come along with them or watch them at a distance me said manon with horror i would liever die than see it done which yet you would have done ay for sore is my need times are changed she had already forgotten her precept to denys an hour later the disagreeable relic of caterpillar existence ceased to canker the worshipful matrons public life and the grim eyes of the past to cast malignant glances down into a white hinds clover field total she made the landlord an average wife and a prime housedog and outlived everybody her troops when they returned from executing with mediaeval naivete the precept off wi the auld love received a shock they found the marketplace black with groups it had been empty an hour ago conscience smote them this came of meddling with the dead however the bolder of the two encouraged by the darkness stole forward alone and slily mingled with a group he soon returned to his companion saying in a tone of reproach not strictly reasonable ye born fool it is only a miracle chapter xlii letters of fire on the church wall had just inquired with an appearance of genuine curiosity why there was no mass for the duke in this time of trouble the supernatural expostulation had been seen by many and had gradually faded leaving the spectators glued there gaping the upshot was that the corporation not choosing to be behind the angelic powers in loyalty to a temporal sovereign invested freely in masses by this an old friend of ours the cure profited in hard cash for which he had a very pretty taste but for this i would not of course have detained you over so trite an occurrence as a miracle denys begged for his arms why disgrace him as well as break his heart then swear on the cross of thy sword not to leave the bastards service until the sedition shall be put down he yielded to necessity and delivered three volleys of oaths and recovered his arms and liberty the troops halted at the three fish and marion at sight of him cried out im out of luck who would have thought to see you again then seeing he was sad and rather hurt than amused at this blunt jest she asked him what was amiss he told her she took a bright view of the case gerard was too handsome and wellbehaved to come to harm the women too would always be on his side moreover it was clear that things must either go well or ill with him in the former case he would strike in with some good company going to rome in the latter he would return home perhaps be there before his friend for you have a trifle of fighting to do in flanders by all accounts she then brought him his gold pieces and steadily refused to accept one though he urged her again and again denys was somewhat convinced by her argument because she concurred with his own wishes and was also cheered a little by finding her so honest it made him think a little better of that world in which his poor little friend was walking alone foot soldiers in small bodies down to twos and threes were already on the road making lazily towards flanders many of them penniless but passed from town to town by the bailiffs with orders for food and lodging on the innkeepers anthony of burgundy overtook numbers of these and gathered them under his standard so that he entered flanders at the head of six hundred men on crossing the frontier he was met by his brother baldwyn with men arms and provisions he organized his whole force and marched on in battle array through several towns not only without impediment but with great acclamations this loyalty called forth comments not altogether gracious this rebellion of ours is a bite growled a soldier called simon who had elected himself denyss comrade denys said nothing but made a little vow to st mars to shoot this anthony of burgundy dead should the rebellion that had cost him gerard prove no rebellion that afternoon they came in sight of a strongly fortified town and a whisper went through the little army that this was a disaffected place but when they came in sight the great gate stood open and the towers that flanked it on each side were manned with a single sentinel apiece so the advancing force somewhat broke their array and marched carelessly when they were within a furlong the drawbridge across the moat rose slowly and creaking till it stood vertical against the fort and the very moment it settled into this warlike attitude down rattled the portcullis at the gate and the towers and curtains bristled with lances and crossbows a stern hum ran through the bastards front rank and spread to the rear halt cried he the word went down the line and they halted herald to the gate a pursuivant spurred out of the ranks and halting twenty yards from the gate raised his bugle with his heralds flag hanging down round it and blew a summons a tall figure in brazen armour appeared over the gate a few fiery words passed between him and the herald which were not audible but their import clear for the herald blew a single keen and threatening note at the walls and came galloping back with war in his face the bastard moved out of the line to meet him and their heads had not been together two seconds ere he turned in his saddle and shouted pioneers to the van and in a moment hedges were levelled and the force took the field and encamped just out of shot from the walls and away went mounted officers flying south east and west to the friendly towns for catapults palisades mantelets raw hides tarbarrels carpenters provisions and all the materials for a siege the bright perspective mightily cheered one drooping soldier at the first clang of the portcullis his eyes brightened and his temple flushed and when the herald came back with battle in his eye he saw it in a moment and for the first time this many days cried courage tout le monde le diable est mort if that great warrior heard how he must have grinned the besiegers encamped a furlong from the walls and made roads kept their pikemen in camp ready for an assault when practicable and sent forward their sappers pioneers catapultiers and crossbowmen these opened a siege by filling the moat and mining or breaching the wall etc and as much of their work had to be done under close fire of arrows quarels bolts stones and little rocks the above artists had need of a hundred eyes and acted in concert with a vigilance and an amount of individual intelligence daring and skill that made a siege very interesting and even amusing to lookers on the first thing they did was to advance their carpenters behind rolling mantelets to erect a stockade high and strong on the very edge of the moat some lives were lost at this but not many for a strong force of crossbowmen including denys rolled their mantelets up and shot over the workmens heads at every besieged who showed his nose and at every loophole arrowslit or other aperture which commanded the particular spot the carpenters happened to be upon covered by their condensed fire these soon raised a high palisade between them and the ordinary missiles from the pierced masonry but the besieged expected this and ran out at night their boards or wooden penthouses on the top of the curtains the curtains were built with square holes near the top to receive the beams that supported these structures the true defence of mediaeval forts from which the besieged delivered their missiles with far more freedom and variety of range than they could shoot through the oblique but immovable loopholes of the curtain or even through the sloping crenelets of the higher towers on this the besiegers brought up mangonels and set them hurling huge stones at these woodworks and battering them to pieces contemporaneously they built a triangular wooden tower as high as the curtain and kept it ready for use and just out of shot this was a terrible sight to the besieged these wooden towers had taken many a town they began to mine underneath that part of the moat the tower stood frowning at and made other preparations to give it a warm reception the besiegers also mined but at another part their object being to get under the square barbican and throw it down all this time denys was behind his mantelet with another arbalestrier protecting the workmen and making some excellent shots these ended by earning him the esteem of an unseen archer who every now and then sent a winged compliment quivering into his mantelet one came and struck within an inch of the narrow slit through which denys was squinting at the moment peste cried he you shoot well my friend come forth and receive my congratulations shall merit such as thine hide its head comrade it is one of those cursed englishmen with his half ell shaft ill not die till ive had a shot at london wall on the side of the besieged was a figure that soon attracted great notice by promenading under fire it was a tall knight clad in complete brass and carrying a light but prodigiously long lance with which he directed the movements of the besieged and when any disaster befell the besiegers this tall knight and his long lance were pretty sure to be concerned in it my young reader will say why did not denys shoot him denys did shoot him every day of his life other arbalestriers shot him archers shot him everybody shot him he was there to be shot apparently but the abomination was he did not mind being shot nay worse he got at last so demoralised as not to seem to know when he was shot he walked his battlements under fire as some stout skipper paces his deck in a suit of flushing calmly oblivious of the april drops that fall on his woollen armour at last the besiegers got spiteful and would not waste any more good steel on him but cursed him and his impervious coat of mail he took those missiles like the rest gunpowder has spoiled war war was always detrimental to the solid interests of mankind but in old times it was good for something it painted well sang divinely furnished iliads but invisible butchery under a pall of smoke a furlong thick who is any the better for that poet with his notebook may repeat suave etiam belli certamina magna tueri but the sentiment is hollow and savours of cuckoo you cant tueri anything but a horrid row he didnt say suave etiam ingentem caliginem tueri per campos instructam they managed better in the middle ages this siege was a small affair but such as it was a writer or minstrel could see it and turn an honest penny by singing it so far then the sport was reasonable and served an end it was a bright day clear but not quite frosty the efforts of the besieging force were concentrated against a space of about two hundred and fifty yards containing two curtains and two towers one of which was the square barbican the other had a pointed roof that was built to overlap resting on a stone machicolade and by this means a row of dangerous crenelets between the roof and the masonry grinned down at the nearer assailants and looked not very unlike the grinders of a modern frigate with each port nearly closed the curtains were overlapped with penthouses somewhat shattered by the mangonels trebuchets and other slinging engines of the besiegers on the besiegers edge of the moat was what seemed at first sight a gigantic arsenal longer than it was broad peopled by human ants and full of busy honest industry and displaying all the various mechanical science of the age in full operation here the lever at work there the winch and pulley here the balance there the capstan everywhere heaps of stones and piles of fascines mantelets and rows of firebarrels mantelets rolling the hammer tapping all day horses and carts in endless succession rattling up with materials only on looking closer into the hive of industry you might observe that arrows were constantly flying to and fro that the cranes did not tenderly deposit their masses of stone but flung them with an indifference to property though on scientific principles and that among the tubs full of arrows and the tarbarrels and the beams the fagots and other utensils here and there a workman or a soldier lay flatter than is usual in limited naps and something more or less feathered stuck in them and blood and other essentials oozed out at the edge of the moat opposite the wooden tower a strong penthouse which they called a cat might be seen stealing towards the curtain and gradually filling up the moat with fascines and rubbish which the workmen flung out at its mouth it was advanced by two sets of ropes passing round pulleys and each worked by a windlass at some distance from the cat the knight burnt the first cat by flinging blazing tarbarrels on it so the besiegers made the roof of this one very steep and covered it with raw hides and the tarbarrels could not harm it then the knight made signs with his spear and a little trebuchet behind the walls began dropping stones just clear of the wall into the moat and at last they got the range and a stone went clean through the roof of the cat and made an ugly hole baldwyn of burgundy saw this and losing his temper ordered the great catapult that was battering the woodwork of the curtain opposite it to be turned and levelled slantwise at this invulnerable knight denys and his englishman went to dinner these two worthies being eternally on the watch for one another had made a sort of distant acquaintance and conversed by signs especially on a topic that in peace or war maintains the same importance sometimes denys would put a piece of bread on the top of his mantelet and then the archer would hang something of the kind out by a string or the order of invitation would be reversed anyway they always managed to dine together and now the engineers proceeded to the unusual step of slinging fiftypound stones at an individual this catapult was a scientific simple and beautiful engine and very effective in vertical fire at the short ranges of the period imagine a firtree cut down and set to turn round a horizontal axis on lofty uprights but not in equilibrio threefourths of the tree being on the hither side at the shorter and thicker end of the tree was fastened a weight of half a ton this butt end just before the discharge pointed towards the enemy by means of a powerful winch the long tapering portion of the tree was forced down to the very ground and fastened by a bolt and the stone placed in a sling attached to the trees nose but this process of course raised the butt end with its huge weight high in the air and kept it there struggling in vain to come down the bolt was now drawn gravity an institution which flourished even then resumed its sway the short end swung furiously down the long end went as furiously round up and at its highest elevation flung the huge stone out of the sling with a tremendous jerk in this case the huge mass so flung missed the knight but came down near him on the penthouse and went through it like paper making an awful gap in roof and floor through the latter fell out two inanimate objects the stone itself and the mangled body of a besieger it had struck they fell down the high curtain side down down and struck almost together the sullen waters of the moat which closed bubbling on them and kept both the stone and the bone two hundred years till cannon mocked those oft perturbed waters and civilization dried them aha a good shot cried baldwyn of burgundy the tall knight retired the besiegers hooted him he reappeared on the platform of the barbican his helmet being just visible above the parapet he seemed very busy and soon an enormous turkish catapult made its appearance on the platform and aided by the elevation at which it was planted flung a twentypound stone some two hundred and forty yards in the air it bounded after that and knocked some dirt into the lord anthonys eye and made him swear the next stone struck a horse that was bringing up a sheaf of arrows in a cart bowled the horse over dead like a rabbit and spilt the cart it was then turned at the besiegers wooden tower supposed to be out of shot sir turk slung stones cut with sharp edges on purpose and struck it repeatedly and broke it in several places the besiegers turned two of their slinging engines on this monster and kept constantly slinging smaller stones on to the platform of the barbican and killed two of the engineers but the turk disdained to retort he flung a fortypound stone on to the besiegers great catapult and hitting it in the neighbourhood of the axis knocked the whole structure to pieces and sent the engineers skipping and yelling in the afternoon as simon was running back to his mantelet from a palisade where he had been shooting at the besieged denys peeping through his slit saw the poor fellow suddenly stare and hold out his arms then roll on his face and a feathered arrow protruded from his back the archer showed himself a moment to enjoy his skill it was the englishman denys already prepared shot his bolt and the murderous archer staggered away wounded but poor simon never moved his wars were over i am unlucky in my comrades said denys the next morning an unwelcome sight greeted the besieged the cat was covered with mattresses and raw hides and fast filling up the moat the knight stoned it but in vain flung burning tarbarrels on it but in vain then with his own hands he let down by a rope a bag of burning sulphur and pitch and stunk them out but baldwyn armed like a lobster ran and bounding on the roof cut the string and the work went on then the knight sent fresh engineers into the mine and undermined the place and underpinned it with beams and covered the beams thickly with grease and tar at break of day the moat was filled and the wooden tower began to move on its wheels towards a part of the curtain on which two catapults were already playing to breach the hoards and clear the way there was something awful and magical in its approach without visible agency for it was driven by internal rollers worked by leverage on the top was a platform where stood the first assailing party protected in front by the drawbridge of the turret which stood vertical till lowered on to the wall but better protected by full suits of armour the beseiged slung at the tower and struck it often but in vain it was well defended with mattresses and hides and presently was at the edge of the moat the knight bade fire the mine underneath it then the turkish engine flung a stone of half a hundredweight right amongst the knights and carried two away with it off the tower on to the plain one lay and writhed the other neither moved nor spake and now the besieging catapults flung blazing tarbarrels and fired the hoards on both sides and the assailants ran up the ladders behind the tower and lowered the drawbridge on to the battered curtain while the catapults in concert flung tarbarrels and fired the adjoining works to dislodge the defenders the armed men on the platform sprang on the bridge led by baldwyn the invulnerable knight and his menatarms met them and a fearful combat ensued in which many a figure was seen to fall headlong down off the narrow bridge but fresh besiegers kept swarming up behind the tower and the besieged were driven off the bridge another minute and the town was taken but so well had the firing of the mine been timed that just at this instant the underpinners gave way and the tower suddenly sank away from the walls tearing the drawbridge clear and pouring the soldiers off it against the masonry and on to the dry moat the besieged uttered a fierce shout and in a moment surrounded baldwyn and his fellows but strange to say offered them quarter while a party disarmed and disposed of these others fired the turret in fifty places with a sort of hand grenades at this work who so busy as the tall knight he put the firebags on his long spear and thrust them into the doomed structure late so terrible to do this he was obliged to stand on a projecting beam of the shattered hoard holding on by the hand of a pikeman to steady himself this provoked denys he ran out from his mantelet hoping to escape notice in the confusion and levelling his crossbow missed the knight clean but sent his bolt into the brain of the pikeman and the tall knight fell heavily from the wall lance and all denys gazed wonderstruck and in that unlucky moment suddenly he felt his arm hot then cold and there was an english arrow skewering it this episode was unnoticed in a much greater matter the knight his armour glittering in the morning sun fell headlong but turning as he neared the water struck it with a slap that sounded a mile off none ever thought to see him again but he fell at the edge of the fascines on which the turret stood all cocked on one side and his spear stuck into them under water and by a mighty effort he got to the side but could not get out anthony sent a dozen knights with a white flag to take him prisoner he submitted like a lamb but said nothing he was taken to anthonys tent that worthy laughed at first at the sight of his muddy armour but presently frowning said i marvel sir that so good a knight as you should know his devoir so ill as turn rebel and give us all this trouble i am nunnunnunnunnunno knight what then a hosier a what then thy armour shall be stripped off and thou shalt be tied to a stake in front of the works and riddled with arrows for a warning to traitors nnnnno dudadudadudadudadont do that why not tutatutatutatownsfolk willhhhhang tother bubabubabubabubabastard what whom your bubbubbubbrother baldwyn what have you knaves taen him the warlike hosier nodded hang the fool said anthony peevishly the warlike hosier watched his eye and doffing his helmet took out of the lining an intercepted letter from the duke bidding the said anthony come to court immediately as he was to represent the court of burgundy at the court of england was to go over and receive the english kings sister and conduct her to her bridegroom the earl of charolois the mission was one very soothing to anthonys pride and also to his love of pleasure for edward the fourth held the gayest and most luxurious court in europe the sly hosier saw he longed to be off and said well gegagegagegagegagive ye a thousand angels to raise the siege and baldwyn ill gegagegagegagegago and send him with the money it was now dinnertime and a flag of truce being hoisted on both sides the sham knight and the true one dined together and came to a friendly understanding but what is your grievance my good friend tutatutatutatutatoo much taxes denys on finding the arrow in his right arm turned his back which was protected by a long shield and walked sulkily into camp he was met by the comte de jarnac who had seen his brilliant shot and finding him wounded into the bargain gave him a handful of broad pieces hast got the better of thy grief arbalestrier methinks my grief yes but not my love as soon as ever i have put down this rebellion i go to holland and there i shall meet with him this event was nearer than denys thought he was relieved from service next day and though his wound was no trifle set out with a stout heart to rejoin his friend in holland chapter xliii a change came over margaret brandt she went about her household duties like one in a dream if peter did but speak a little quickly to her she started and fixed two terrified eyes on him she went less often to her friend margaret van eyck and was ill at her ease when there instead of meeting her warm old friends caresses she used to receive them passive and trembling and sometimes almost shrink from them but the most extraordinary thing was she never would go outside her own house in daylight when she went to tergou it was after dusk and she returned before daybreak she would not even go to matins at last peter unobservant as he was noticed it and asked her the reason methinks the folk all look at me one day margaret van eyck asked her what was the matter a scared look and a flood of tears were all the reply the old lady expostulated gently what sweetheart afraid to confide your sorrows to me i have no sorrows madam but of my own making i am kinder treated than i deserve especially in this house then why not come oftener my dear i come oftener than i deserve and she sighed deeply there reicht is bawling for you said margaret van eyck go childwhat on earth can it be turning possibilities over in her mind she thought margaret must be mortified at the contempt with which she was treated by gerards family i will take them to task for it at least such of them as are women and the very next day she put on her hood and cloak and followed by reicht went to the hosiers house catherine received her with much respect and thanked her with tears for her kindness to gerard but when encouraged by this her visitor diverged to margaret brandt catherines eyes dried and her lips turned to half the size and she looked as only obstinate ignorant women can look when they put on this cast of features you might as well attempt to soften or convince a brick wall margaret van eyck tried but all in vain so then not being herself used to be thwarted she got provoked and at last went out hastily with an abrupt and mutilated curtsey which catherine returned with an air rather of defiance than obeisance outside the door margaret van eyck found reicht conversing with a pale girl on crutches margaret van eyck was pushing by them with heightened colour and a scornful toss intended for the whole family when suddenly a little delicate hand glided timidly into hers and looking round she saw two dovelike eyes with the water in them that sought hers gratefully and at the same time imploringly the old lady read this wonderful look complex as it was and down went her choler she stopped and kissed kates brow i see said she mind then i leave it to you returned home she saidi have been to a house today where i have seen a very common thing and a very uncommon thing i have seen a stupid obstinate woman and i have seen an angel in the flesh with a faceif i had it here id take down my brushes once more and try and paint it little kate did not belie the good opinion so hastily formed of her she waited a better opportunity and told her mother what she had learned from reicht heynes that margaret had shed her very blood for gerard in the wood see mother how she loves him who would not love him oh mother think of it poor thing ay wench she has her own trouble no doubt as well as we ours i cant abide the sight of blood let alone my own this was a point gained but when kate tried to follow it up she was stopped short about a month after this a soldier of the dalgetty tribe returning from service in burgundy brought a letter one evening to the hosiers house he was away on business but the rest of the family sat at supper the soldier laid the letter on the table by catherine and refusing all guerdon for bringing it went off to sevenbergen the letter was unfolded and spread out and curiously enough though not one of them could read they could all tell it was gerards handwriting and your father must be away cried catherine are ye not ashamed of yourselves not one that can read your brothers letter but although the words were to them what hieroglyphics are to us there was something in the letter they could read there is an art can speak without words unfettered by the penmans limits it can steal through the eye into the heart and brain alike of the learned and unlearned and it can cross a frontier or a sea yet lose nothing it is at the mercy of no translator for it writes an universal language when therefore they saw this a picture of two hands clasped together which gerard had drawn with his pencil between the two short paragraphs of which his letter consisted they read it and it went straight to their hearts gerard was bidding them farewell as they gazed on that simple sketch in every turn and line of which they recognized his manner gerard seemed present and bidding them farewell the women wept over it till they could see it no longer giles said poor gerard in a lower voice than seemed to belong to him even cornelis and sybrandt felt a momentary remorse and sat silent and gloomy but how to get the words read to them they were loth to show their ignorance and their emotion to a stranger the dame van eyck said kate timidly and so i will kate she has a good heart she loves gerard too she will be glad to hear of him i was short with her when she came here but i will make my submission and then she will tell me what my poor child says to me she was soon at margaret van eycks house reicht took her into a room and said bide a minute she is at her orisons there was a young woman in the room seated pensively by the stove but she rose and courteously made way for the visitor thank you young lady the winter nights are cold and your stove is a treat catherine then while warming her hands inspected her companion furtively from head to foot inclusive the young person wore an ordinary wimple but her gown was trimmed with fur which was in those days almost a sign of superior rank or wealth but what most struck catherine was the candour and modesty of the face she felt sure of sympathy from so good a countenance and began to gossip now what think you brings me here young lady it is a letter a letter from my poor boy that is far away in some savage part or other and i take shame to say that none of us can read it i wonder whether you can read yes can ye now it is much to your credit my dear i dare say she wont be long but every minute is an hour to a poor longing mother i will read it to you bless you my dear bless you in her unfeigned eagerness she never noticed the suppressed eagerness with which the hand was slowly put out to take the letter she did not see the tremor with which the fingers closed on it come then read it to me prithee i am wearying for it the first words are to my honoured parents ay and he always did honour us poor soul god and the saints have you in his holy keeping and bless you by night and by day your one harsh deed is forgotten your years of love remembered catherine laid her hand on her bosom and sank back in her chair with one long sob then comes this madam it doth speak for itself a long farewell ay go on bless you girl you give me sorry comfort still tis comfort to my brothers cornelis and sybrandtbe content you will see me no more what does that mean ah to my sister kate little angel of my fathers house be kind to her ah that is margaret brandt my dearhis sweetheart poor soul ive not been kind to her my dear forgive me gerard for poor gerards sake since grief to her is death to meah and nature resenting the poor girls struggle for unnatural composure suddenly gave way and she sank from her chair and lay insensible with the letter in her hand and her head on catherines knees chapter xliv experienced women are not frightened when a woman faints or do they hastily attribute it to anything but physical causes which they have often seen produce it catherine bustled about laid the girl down with her head on the floor quite flat opened the window and unloosed her dress as she lay not till she had done all this did she step to the door and say rather loudly come here if you please margaret van eyck and reicht came and found margaret lying quite flat and catherine beating her hands oh my poor girl what have you done to her me said catherine angrily what has happened then nothing madam nothing more than is natural in her situation margaret van eyck coloured with ire you do well to speak so coolly said she you that are the cause of her situation that i am not said catherine bluntly nor any woman born what was it not you and your husband that kept them apart and now he has gone to italy all alone situation indeed you have broken her heart amongst you why madam who is it then in heavens name to hear you one would think this was my gerards lass but that cant be this fur never cost less than five crowns the ell besides this young gentlewoman is a wife or ought to be of course she ought and who is the cause she is none who came before them at the very altar god forgive them whoever it was said catherine gravely me it was not nor my man well said the other a little softened now you have seen her perhaps you will not be quite so bitter against her madam she is coming to thank heaven me bitter against her said catherine no that is all over poor soul trouble behind her and trouble afore her and to think of my setting her of all living women to read gerards letter to me ay and that was what made her go off ill be sworn she is coming to what sweetheart be not afeard none are here but friends they seated her in an easy chair as the colour was creeping back to her face and lips catherine drew margaret van eyck aside is she staying with you if you please no madam i wouldnt let her go back to sevenbergen tonight then that is as she pleases she still refuses to bide the night ay but you are older than she is you can make her there she is beginning to notice catherine then put her mouth to margaret van eycks ear for half a moment it did not seem time enough to whisper a word far less a sentence but on some topics females can flash communication to female like lightning or thought itself the old lady started and whispered back its false it is a calumny it is monstrous look at her face it is blasphemy to accuse such a face tut tut tut said the other you might as well say this is not my hand i ought to know and i tell ye it is so then much to margaret van eycks surprise she went up to the girl and taking her round the neck kissed her warmly i suffered for gerard and you shed your blood for him i do hear his own words show me that i have been to blame the very words you have read to me ay gerard my child i have held aloof from her but ill make it up to her once i begin you are my daughter from this hour another warm embrace sealed this hasty compact and the woman of impulse was gone margaret lay back in her chair and a feeble smile stole over her face gerards mother had kissed her and called her daughter but the next moment she saw her old friend looking at her with a vexed air i wonder you let that woman kiss you his mother murmured margaret half reproachfully mother or no mother you would not let her touch you if you knew what she whispered in my ear about you about me said margaret faintly ay about you whom she never saw till tonight the old lady was proceeding with some hesitation and choice of language to make margaret share her indignation when an unlookedfor interruption closed her lips the young woman slid from her chair to her knees and began to pray piteously to her for pardon from the words and the manner of her penitence a bystander would have gathered she had inflicted some cruel wrong some intolerable insult upon her venerable friend chapter xlv the little party at the hosiers house sat at table discussing the recent event when their mother returned and casting a piercing glance all round the little circle laid the letter flat on the table she repeated every word of it by memory following the lines with her finger to cheat herself and bearers into the notion that she could read the words or nearly then suddenly lifting her head she cast another keen look on cornelis and sybrandt their eyes fell on this the storm that had long been brewing burst on their heads catherine seemed to swell like an angry hen ruffling her feathers and out of her mouth came a rhone and saone of wisdom and twaddle of great and mean invective such as no male that ever was born could utter in one current and not many women the following is a fair though a small sample of her words only they were uttered all in one breath i have long had my doubts that you blew the flame betwixt gerard and your father and set that old rogue ghysbrecht on and now here are gerards own written words to prove it you have driven your own flesh and blood into a far land and robbed the mother that bore you of her darling the pride of her eye the joy of her heart but you are all of a piece from end to end when you were all boys together my others were a comfort but you were a curse mischievous and sly and took a woman half a day to keep your clothes whole for why work wears cloth but play cuts it with the beard comes prudence but none came to you still the last to go to bed and the last to leave it and why because honesty goes to bed early and industry rises betimes where there are two lieabeds in a house there are a pair of neerdoweels often ive sat and looked at your ways and wondered where ye came from ye dont take after your father and ye are no more like me than a wasp is to an ant sure ye were changed in the cradle or the cuckoo dropped ye on my floor for ye have not our hands nor our hearts of all my blood none but you ever jeered them that god afflicted but often when my back was turned ive heard you mock at giles because he is not as big as some and at my lily kate because she is not so strong as a flanders mare after that rob a church an you will for you can be no worse in his eyes that made both kate and giles and in mine that suffered for them poor darlings as i did for you you paltry unfeeling treasonable curs no i will not hush my daughter they have filled the cup too full it takes a deal to turn a mothers heart against the sons she has nursed upon her knees and many is the time i have winked and wouldnt see too much and bitten my tongue lest their father should know them as i do he would have put them to the door that moment but now they have filled the cup too full and where got ye all this money for this last month you have been rolling in it you never wrought for it i wish i may never hear from other mouths how ye got it it is since that night you were out so late and your head came back so swelled cornelis sloth and greed are illmated my masters lovers of money must sweat or steal well if you robbed any poor soul of it it was some woman ill go bail for a man would drive you with his naked hand no matter it is good for one thing it has shown me how you will guide our gear if ever it comes to be yourn i have watched you my lads this while you have spent a groat today between you and i spend scarce a groat a week and keep you all good and bad no i give up waiting for the shoes that will maybe walk behind your coffin for this shop and this house shall never be yourn gerard is our heir poor gerard whom you have banished and done your best to kill after that never call me mother again but you have made him tenfold dearer to me my poor lost boy i shall soon see him again shall hold him in my arms and set him on my knees ay you may stare you are too crafty and yet not crafty enow you cut the stalk away but you left the seedthe seed that shall outgrow you and outlive you margaret brandt is quick and it is gerards and what is gerards is mine and i have prayed the saints it may be a boy and it willit must kate when i found it was so my bowels yearned over her child unborn as if it had been my own he is our heir he will outlive us you will not for a bad heart in a carcass is like the worm in the nut soon brings the body to dust so kate take down gerards bib and tucker that are in the drawer you wot of and one of these days we will carry them to sevenbergen we will borrow peter buyskens cart and go comfort gerards wife under her burden she is his wife who is ghysbrecht van swieten can he come between a couple and the altar and sunder those that god and the priest make one she is my daughter and i am as proud of her as i am of you kate almost and as for you keep out of my way awhile for you are like the black dog in my eyes cornelis and sybrandt took the hint and slunk out aching with remorse and impenitence and hate they avoided her eye as much as ever they could and for many days she never spoke a word good bad or indifferent to either of them liberaverat animum suum chapter xlvi catherine was a good housewife who seldom left home for a day and then one thing or another always went amiss she was keenly conscious of this and watching for a slack tide in things domestic put off her visit to sevenbergen from day to day and one afternoon that it really could have been managed peter buyskens mule was out of the way at last one day eli asked her before all the family whether it was true she had thought of visiting margaret brandt ay my man then i do forbid you oh do you i do then there is no more to be said i suppose said she colouring not a word replied eli sternly when she was alone with her daughter she was very severe not upon eli but upon herself behoved me rather go thither like a cat at a robin but this was me all over i am like a silly hen that can lay no egg without cackling and convening all the house to rob her ont next time you and i are after aught the least amiss lets dot in heavens name then and there and not take time to think about it far less talk so then if they take us to task we can say alack we knew nought we thought no ill now whod ever and so forth for two pins id go thither in all their teeth defiance so wild and picturesque staggered kate nay mother with patience father will come round and so will michaelmas but when and i was so bent on you seeing the girl then we could have put our heads together about her say what they will there is no judging body or beast but by the eye and were i to have fifty more sons id neer thwart one of thems fancy till such time as i had clapped my eyes upon her and seen quicksands say you i should have thought of that before condemning gerard his fancy but there life is a school and the lesson neer done we put down one fault and take up tother and so go blundering here and blundering there till we blunder into our graves and theres an end of us mother said kate timidly well what is acoming now no good news though by the look of you what on earth can make the poor wretch so scared an avowal she hath to make faltered kate faintly now there is a noble word for ye said catherine proudly our gerard taught thee that ill go bail come then out with thy vowel well then sooth to say i have seen her and and spoken with her to boot and never told me after this marvels are dirt mother you were so hot against her i waited till i could tell you without angering you worse ay said catherine half sadly half bitterly like mother like daughter cowardice it is our bane the others i whiles buffet or how would the house fare but did you kate ever have harsh word or look from your poor mother that younay i will not have ye cry girl ten to one ye had your reason so rise up brave heart and tell me all better late than neer and first and foremost when ever and how ever wend you to sevenbergen wi your poor crutches and i not know i never was there in my life and mammy dear to say that i neer wished to see her that i will not but i neer went nor sought to see her there now said catherine disputatively said i not twas all unlike my girl to seek her unbeknown to me come now for im all agog then thus twas it came to my ears no matter how and prithee good mother on my knees neer ask me how that gerard was a prisoner in the stadthouse tower ah by fathers behest as twas pretended catherine uttered a sigh that was almost a moan blacker than i thought she muttered faintly giles and i went out at night to bid him be of good cheer and there at the tower foot was a brave lass quite strange to me i vow on the same errand lookee there now kate at first we did properly frighten one another through the place his bad name and our poor heads being so full o divels and we whitened a bit in moonshine but next moment quo i you are margaret and you are kate quo she think ont did one ever twas gerard he will have been talking backards and forrards of thee to her and her to thee in return for this kate bestowed on catherine one of the prettiest presents in naturethe composite kiss ie she imprinted on her cheek a single kiss which said quite correct good clever mother for guessing so right and quick how sweet for us twain to be of one mind again after never having been otherwise etc now then speak thy mind child gerard is not here alas what am i saying would to heaven he were well then mother she is comely and wrongs her picture but little eh dear hark to young folk i am for good acts not good looks loves she my boy as he did ought to be loved sevenbergen is farther from the stadthouse than we are said kate thoughtfully yet she was there afore me catherine nodded intelligence nay more she had got him out ere i came ay down from the captives tower catherine shook her head incredulously the highest tower for miles it is not feasible tis sooth though she and an old man she brought found means and wit to send him up a rope there twas dangling from his prison and our giles went up it when first i saw it hang i said this is glamour but when the frank lasss arms came round me and her bosom did beat on mine and her cheeks wet then said i tis not glamour tis love for she is not like me but lusty and able and dear heart even i poor frail creature do feel sometimes as i could move the world for them i love i love you mother and she loves gerard god bless her fort god bless her but but what lamb her love is it for very certain honest tis most strange but that very thing which hath warmed your heart hath somewhat cooled mine towards her poor soul she is no wife you know mother when all is done humph they have stood at the altar together ay but they went as they came maid and bachelor the parson saith he so nay for that i know not then ill take no mans word but his in such a tangled skein after some reflection she added natheless art right girl ill to sevenbergen alone a wife i am but not a slave we are all in the dark here and she holds the clue i must question her and no one by least of all you ill not take any lily to a house wi a spot no not to a palace o gold and silver the more catherine pondered this conversation the more she felt drawn towards margaret and moreover she was all agog with curiosity a potent passion with us all and nearly omnipotent with those who like catherine do not slake it with reading at last one fine day after dinner she whispered to kate keep the house from going to pieces an ye can and donned her best kirtle and hood and her scarlet clocked hose and her new shoes and trudged briskly off to sevenbergen troubling no mans mule when she got there she inquired where margaret brandt lived the first person she asked shook his head and saidthe name is strange to me she went a little farther and asked a girl of about fifteen who was standing at a door father said the girl speaking into the house here is another after that magicians daughter the man came out and told catherine peter brandts cottage was just outside the town on the east side you may see the chimney hence and he pointed it out to her but you will not find them there neither father nor daughter they have left the town this week bless you say not so good man and me walken all the way from tergou from tergou then you must ha met the soldier what soldier ay i did meet a soldier well then yon soldier was here seeking that selfsame margaret ay and warnt a mad with us because she was gone put in the girl his long beard and her cheek are no strangers i warrant say no more than ye know said catherine sharply you are young to take to slandering your elders stay tell we more about this soldier good man nay i know no more than that he came hither seeking margaret brandt and i told him she and her father had made a moonlight flit ont this day sennight and that some thought the devil had flown away with them being magicians and says he the devil fly away with thee for thy ill news that was my thanks but i doubt tis a lie said he an you think so said i go and see i will said he and burst out wi a hantle o gibberish my wife thinks twas curses and hied him to the cottage presently back a comes and sings tother tune you were right and i was wrong says he and shoves a silver coin in my hand show it the wife some of ye then shell believe me i have been called a liar once today it needs not said catherine inspecting the coin all the same and he seemed quiet and sad like didnt he now wench that a did said the young woman warmly and dame he was just as pretty a man as ever i clapped eyes on cheeks like a rose and shining beard and eyes in his head like sloes i saw he was well bearded said catherine but for the rest at my age i scan them not as when i was young and foolish but he seemed right civil doffed his bonnet to me as i had been a queen and i did drop him my best reverence for manners beget manners but little i wist he had been her light o love and most likely thewho bakes for this town the man not being acquainted with her opened his eyes at this transition swift and smooth well dame there be two john bush and eric donaldson they both bide in this street then god be with you good people said she and proceeded but her sprightly foot came flat on the ground now and no longer struck it with little jerks and cocking heel she asked the bakers whether peter brandt had gone away in their debt bush said they were not customers donaldson said not a stiver his daughter had come round and paid him the very night they went didnt believe they owed a copper in the town so catherine got all the information of that kind she wanted with very little trouble can you tell me what sort this margaret was said she as she turned to go well somewhat too reserved for my taste i like a chatty customerwhen im not too busy but she bore a high character for being a good daughter tis no small praise a welllooking lass i am told why whence come you wyfe from tergou oh ay well you shall judge the lads clept her the beauty of sevenbergen the lasses did scout it merrily and terribly pulled her to pieces and found so many faults no two could agree where the fault lay that is enough said catherine i see the bakers are no fools in sevenbergen and the young women no shallower than in other burghs she bought a manchet of bread partly out of sympathy and justice she kept a shop partly to show her household how much better bread she gave them daily and returned to tergou dejected kate met her outside the town with beaming eyes well kate lass it is a happy thing i went i am heartbroken gerard has been sore abused the child is none of ourn nor the mother from this hour alas mother i fathom not your meaning ask me no more girl but never mention her name to me again that is all kate acquiesced with a humble sigh and they went home together they found a soldier seated tranquilly by their fire the moment they entered the door he rose and saluted them civilly they stood and looked at him kate with some little surprise but catherine with a great deal and with rising indignation what makes you here was catherines greeting i came to seek after margaret well we know no such person say not so dame sure you know her by name margaret brandt we have heard of her for that matterto our cost comes dame prithee tell me at least where she bides i know not where she bides and care not denys felt sure this was a deliberate untruth he bit his lip well i looked to find myself in an enemys country at this tergou but maybe if ye knew all ye would not be so dour i do know all replied catherine bitterly this morn i knew nought then suddenly setting her arms akimbo she told him with a raised voice and flashing eyes she wondered at his cheek sitting down by that hearth of all hearths in the world may satan fly away with your hearth to the lake of fire and brimstone shouted denys who could speak flemish fluently your own servant bade me sit there till you came else i had neer troubled your hearth my malison on it and on the churlish rooftree that greets an unoffending stranger this way and he strode scowling to the door oh oh ejaculated catherine frightened and also a little consciencestricken and the virago sat suddenly down and burst into tears her daughter followed suit quietly but without loss of time a shrewd writer now unhappily lost to us has somewhere the following dialogue she i feel all a womans weakness he then you are invincible denys by anticipation confirmed that valuable statement he stood at the door looking ruefully at the havoc his thunderbolt of eloquence had made nay wife said he weep not neither for a soldiers hasty word i mean not all i said why your house is your own and what right in it have i there now ill go what is to do said a grave manly voice it was eli he had come in from the shop here is a ruffian been ascolding of your women folk and making them cry explained denys little kate what ist for ruffians do not use to call themselves ruffians said eli the sensible ere she could explain hold your tongue girl said catherine muriel bade him sat down and i knew not that and wyted on him and he was going and leaving his malison on us root and branch i was never so becursed in all my days oh oh oh you were both somewhat to blame both you and he said eli calmly however what the servant says the master should still stand to we keep not open house but yet we are not poor enough to grudge a seat at our hearth in a cold day to a wayfarer with an honest face and as i think a wounded man so end all malice and sit ye down wounded cried mother and daughter in a breath think you a soldier slings his arm for sport nay tis but an arrow said denys cheerfully but an arrow said kate with concentrated horror where were our eyes mother nay in good sooth a trifle which however i will pray mesdames to accept as an excuse for my vivacity tis these little foolish trifling wounds that fret a man worthy sir why look ye now sweeter temper than our gerard never breathed yet when the bear did but strike a piece no bigger than a crown out of his calf he turned so hot and choleric yhad said he was no son of yours but got by the good knight sir john pepper on his wife dame mustard who is this a dwarf your servant master giles your servant soldier roared the newcomer denys started he had not counted on exchanging greetings with a petard denyss words had surprised his hosts but hardly more than their deportment now did him they all three came creeping up to where he sat and looked down into him with their lips parted as if he had been some strange phenomenon and growing agitation succeeded to amazement now hush said eli let none speak but i young man said he solemnly in gods name who are you that know us though we know you not and that shake our hearts speaking to us ofthe absentour poor rebellious son whom heaven forgive and bless what master said denys lowering his voice hath he not writ to you hath he not told you of me denys of burgundy he hath writ but three lines and named not denys of burgundy nor any stranger ay i mind the long letter was to his sweetheart this margaret and she has decamped plague take her and how i am to find her heaven knows what she is not your sweetheart then who dame ant please you why margaret brandt how can my comrades sweetheart be mine i know her not from noahs niece how should i i never saw her whist with this idle chat kate said eli impatiently and let the young man answer me how came you to know gerard our son prithee now think on a parents cares and answer me straightforward like a soldier as thou art and shall i was paid off at flushing and started for burgundy on the german frontier i lay at the same inn with gerard i fancied him i said be my comrade he was loth at first consented presently many a weary league we trode together never were truer comrades never will be while earth shall last first i left my route a bit to be with him then he his to be with me we talked of sevenbergen and tergou a thousand times and of all in this house we had our troubles on the road but battling them together made them light i saved his life from a bear he mine in the rhine for he swims like a duck and i like a hod o bricks and one anothers lives at an inn in burgundy where we two held a room for a good hour against seven cutthroats and crippled one and slew two and your son did his devoir like a man and met the stoutest champion i ever countered and spitted him like a suckingpig else i had not been here but just when all was fair and i was to see him safe aboard ship for rome if not to rome itself met us that son of athe lord anthony of burgundy and his men making for flanders then in insurrection tore us by force apart took me where i got some broad pieces in hand and a broad arrow in my shoulder and left my poor gerard lonesome at that sad parting soldier though i be these eyes did rain salt scalding tears and so did his poor soul his last word to me was go comfort margaret so here i be mine to him was think no more of rome make for rhine and down stream home now say for you know best did i advise him well or ill soldier take my hand said eli god bless thee god bless thee and his lip quivered it was all his reply but more eloquent than many words catherine did not answer at all but she darted from the room and bade muriel bring the best that was in the house and returned with wood in both arms and heaped the fire and took out a snowwhite cloth from the press and was going in a great hurry to lay it for gerards friend when suddenly she sat down and all the power ebbed rapidly out of her body father cried kate whose eye was as quick as her affection denys started up but eli waved him back and flung a little water sharply in his wifes face this did her instant good she gasped so sudden my poor boy eli whispered denys take no notice she thinks of him night and day they pretended not to observe her and she shook it off and hustled and laid the cloth with her own hands but as she smoothed it her hands trembled and a tear or two stole down her cheeks they could not make enough of denys they stuffed him and crammed him and then gathered round him and kept filling his glass in turn while by that genial blaze of fire and ruby wine and eager eyes he told all that i have related and a vast number of minor details which an artist however minute omits but how different the effect on my readers and on this small circle to them the interest was already made before the first word came from his lips it was all about gerard and he who sat there telling it them was warm from gerard and an actor with him in all these scenes the flesh and blood around that fire quivered for their severed member hearing its struggles and perils i shall ask my readers to recall to memory all they can of gerards journey with denys and in their minds eye to see those very matters told by his comrade to an exiles father all stoic outside all father within and to two poor women an exiles mother and a sister who were all love and pity and tender anxiety both outside and in now would you mind closing this book for a minute and making an effort to realize all this it will save us so much repetition then you will not be surprised when i tell you that after a while giles came softly and curled himself up before the fire and lay gazing at the speaker with a reverence almost canine and that when the rough soldier had unconsciously but thoroughly betrayed his better qualities and above all his rare affection for gerard kate though timorous as a bird stole her little hand into the warriors huge brown palm where it lay an instant like a teaspoonful of cream spilt on a platter then nipped the ball of his thumb and served for a kardiometer in other words fate is just even to rival storytellers and balances matters denys had to pay a tax to his audience which i have not whenever gerard was in too much danger the female faces became so white and their poor little throats gurgled so he was obliged in common humanity to spoil his recital suspense is the soul of narrative and thus dealt roughandtender of burgundy with his best suspenses now dame take not on till ye hear the end maamselle let not your cheek blanch so courage it looks ugly but you shall hear how we won through had he miscarried and i at hand would i be alive and meantime kates little kardiometer or heartmeasurer graduated emotion and pinched by scale at its best it was by no means a highpressure engine but all is relative denys soon learned the tender gamut and when to water the suspense and extract the thrill as far as possible on one occasion only he cannily indemnified his narrative for this drawback falling personally into the rhine and sinking he got pinched he denys to his surprise and satisfaction oho thought he and on the principle of the anatomists experimentum in corpore vili kept himself a quarter of an hour under water under pressure all the time and even when gerard had got hold of him he was loth to leave the river so less conscientious than i was swam with gerard to the east bank first and was about to land but detected the officers and their intent chaffed them a little space treading water then turned and swam wearily all across and at last was obliged to get out for very shame or else acknowledge himself a pike so permitted himself to land exhausted and the pressure relaxed it was eleven oclock an unheardof hour but they took no note of time this night and denys had still much to tell them when the door was opened quietly and in stole cornelis and sybrandt looking hangdog they had this night been drinking the very last drop of their mysterious funds catherine feared her husband would rebuke them before denys but he only looked sadly at them and motioned them to sit down quietly denys it was who seemed discomposed he knitted his brows and eyed them thoughtfully and rather gloomily then turned to catherine what say you dame the rest tomorrow for i am somewhat weary and it waxes late so be it said eli but when denys rose to go to his inn he was instantly stopped by catherine and think you to lie from this house gerards room has been got ready for you hours agone the sheets ill not say much for seeing i spun the flax and wove the web then would i lie in them blindfold was the gallant reply ah dame our poor gerard was the one for fine linen he could hardly forgive the honest germans their coarse flax and wheneer my traitors of countrymen did amiss a would excuse them saying well well bonnes toiles sont en bourgogne that means there be good lenten cloths in burgundy but indeed he beat all for bywords and cleanliness oh eli eli doth not our son come back to us at each word ay buss me my poor kate you and i know all that passeth in each others hearts this night none other can but god chapter xlvii denys took an opportunity next day and told mother and daughter the rest excusing himself characteristically for not letting cornelis and sybrandt hear of it it is not for me to blacken them they come of a good stock but gerard looks on them as no friends of his in this matter and im gerards comrade and it is a rule with us soldiers not to tell the enemy aughtbut lies catherine sighed but made no answer the adventures he related cost them a tumult of agitation and grief and sore they wept at the parting of the friends which even now denys could not tell without faltering but at last all merged in the joyful hope and expectation of gerards speedy return in this denys confidently shared but reminded them that was no reason why he should neglect his friends wishes and last words in fact should gerard return next week and no margaret to be found what sort of figure should he cut catherine had never felt so kindly towards the truant margaret as now and she was fully as anxious to find her and be kind to her before gerards return as denys was but she could not agree with him that anything was to be gained by leaving this neighbourhood to search for her she must have told somebody whither she was going it is not as though they were dishonest folk flying the country they owe not a stiver in sevenbergen and dear heart denys you cant hunt all holland for her can i not said denys grimly that we shall see he added after some reflection that they must divide their forces she stay here with eyes and ears wide open and he ransack every town in holland for her if need be but she will not be many leagues from here they be three three fly not so fast nor far as one that is sense said catherine but she insisted on his going first to the demoiselle van eyck she and our margaret were bosom friends she knows where the girl is gone if she will but tell us denys was for going to her that instant so catherine in a turn of the hand made herself one shade neater and took him with her she was received graciously by the old lady sitting in a richly furnished room and opened her business the tapestry dropped out of margaret van eycks hands gone gone from sevenbergen and not told me the thankless girl this turn greatly surprised the visitors what you know not when was she here last maybe ten days agone i had taen out my brushes after so many years to paint her portrait i did not do it though for reasons catherine remarked it was a most strange thing she should go away bag and baggage like this without with your leave or by your leave why or wherefore was ever aught so untoward just when all our hearts are warm to her and here is gerards mate come from the ends of the earth with comfort for her from gerard and cant find her and gerard himself expected what to do i know not but sure she is not parted like this without a reason can ye not give us the clue my good demoiselle prithee now i have it not to give said the elder lady rather peevishly then i can said reicht heynes showing herself in the doorway with colour somewhat heightened so you have been hearkening all the time eh what are my ears for mistress true well throw us the light of thy wisdom on this dark matter there is no darkness that i see said reicht and the clue why an ye callt a twoplye twine and the ends ont in this room een now yell not be far out oh mistress i wonder at you sitting there pretending marry come up and the mistresss cheek was now nearly as red as the servants so twas i drove the foolish girl away you did your share mistress what sort of greeting gave you her last time she came think you she could miss to notice it and she all friendless and you said i have altered my mind about painting of you says you a turning up your nose at her i did not turn up my nose it is not shaped like yours for looking heavenward oh all our nosen can follow our heartys bent for that matter poor soul she did come into the kitchen to me i am not to be painted now said she and the tears in her eyes she said no more but i knew well what she did mean i had seen ye well said margaret van eyck i do confess so much and i make you the judge madam know that these young girls can do nothing of their own heads but are most apt at mimicking aught their sweethearts do now your gerard is reasonably handy at many things and among the rest at the illuminators craft and margaret she is his pupil and a patient one what marvel having a womans eye for colour and eke a lover to ape tis a trick i despise at heart for by it the great art of colour which should be royal aspiring and free becomes a poor slave to the petty crafts of writing and printing and is fettered imprisoned and made little body and soul to match the littleness of books and go to church in a rich fools pocket natheless affection rules us all and when the poor wench would bring me her thorn leaves and lilies and ivy and dewberries and ladybirds and butterfly grubs and all the scum of naturestuck fast in goldleaf like wasps in a honeypot and withal her diurnal book showing she had pored an hundred or an hundred and fifty or two hundred hours over each singular page certes i was wroth that an immortal soul and many hours of labour and much manual skill should be flung away on natures trash leaves insects grubs and on barren letters but having bowels i did perforce restrain and as it were dam my better feelings and looked kindly at the work to see how it might be bettered and said i sith heaven for our sins hath doomed us to spend time and soul and colour on great letters and little beetles omitting such small fry as saints and heroes their acts and passions why not present the scum naturally i told her the grapes i saw walking abroad did hang i the air not stick in a wall and even these insects quo i and nature her slime in general pass not their noxious lives wedged miserably in metal prisons like flies in honeypots and gluepots but do crawl or hover at large infesting air ah my dear friend says she i see now whither you drive but this ground is gold whereon we may not shade who said so quoth i all teachers of this craft says she and to make an end o me at once i trow gerard himself that for gerard himself quoth i and all the gang gie me a brush then chose i to shade her fruit and reptiles a colour false in nature but true relatively to that monstrous ground of glaring gold and in five minutes out came a bunch of raspberries stalk and all and amost flew in your mouth likewise a butterfly grub she had so truly presented as might turn the stoutest stomach my lady she flings her arms round my neck and says she oh did she now the little love observed denys succeeding at last in wedging in a word margaret van eyck stared at him and then smiled she went on to tell them how from step to step she had been led on to promise to resume the art she had laid aside with a sigh when her brothers died and to paint the madonna once morewith margaret for model incidentally she even revealed how girls are turned into saints thy hair is adorable said i why tis red quo she ay quoth i but what a red how brown how glossy most hair is not worth a straw to us painters thine the artists very hue but thy violet eyes which smack of earth being now languid for lack of one gerard now full of fire in hopes of the same gerard these will i lift to heaven in fixed and holy meditation and thy nose which doth already somewhat aspire that way though not so piously as reichts will i debase a trifle and somewhat enfeeble thy chin enfeeble her chin alack what may that mean ye go beyond me mistress tis a resolute chin not a jot too resolute for this wicked world but when ye come to a madonna no thank you well i never a resolute chin denys the darling and now comes the rub when you told me she wasthe way she is it gave me a shock i dropped my brushes was i going to turn a girl that couldnt keep her lover at a distance into the virgin mary at my time of life i love the poor ninny still but i adore our blessed lady say you a painter must not be peevish in such matters well most painters are men and men are fine fellows they can do aught their saints and virgins are neither more nor less than their lemans saving your presence but know that for this very reason half their craft is lost on me which find beneath their angels white wings the very trollops i have seen flaunting it on the streets bejewelled like paynim idols and put on like the queens in a pack o cards and i am not a fine fellow but only a woman and my painting is but one half craft and tother half devotion so now you may read me twas foolish maybe but i could not help it yet am i sorry and the old lady ended despondently a discourse which she had commenced in amighty defiant tone well you know dame observed catherine you must think it would go to the poor girls heart and she so fond of ye margaret van eyck only sighed the frisian girl after biting her lips impatiently a little while turned upon catherine why dame think you twas for that alone margaret and peter hath left sevenbergen nay for what else then what else why because gerards people slight her so cruel who would bide among hardhearted folk that ha driven her lad t italy and now he is gone relent not but face it out and neer come anigh her that is left reicht i was going oh ay going and going and going ye should ha said less or else done more but with your words you did uplift her heart and let it down wi your deeds they have never been said the poor thing to me with such a sigh ay here is one can feel for her for i too am far from my friends and often when first i came to holland i did used to take a hearty cry all to myself but ten times liever would i be reicht heynes with nought but the leagues atween me and all my kith than be as she is i the midst of them that ought to warm to her and yet to fare as lonesome as i alack reicht i did go but yestreen and had gone before but one plaguy thing or tother did still come and hinder me mistress did aught hinder ye to eat your dinner any one of those days i trow not and had your heart been as good towards your own flesh and blood as twas towards your fleshers meat nought had prevailed to keep you from her that sat lonely a watching the road for you and comfort wi your childs child a beating neath her bosom here this rude young woman was interrupted by an incident not uncommon in a domestics bright existence the van eyck had been nettled by the attack on her but with due tact had gone into ambush she now sprang out of it since you disrespect my guests seek another place with all my heart said reicht stoutly nay mistress put in the goodnatured catherine true folk will still speak out her tongue is a stinger here the water came into the speakers eyes by way of confirmation but better she said it than thought it so now t wont rankle in her and part with her for me that shall ye not beshrew the wench she wots she is a good servant and takes advantage we poor wretches which keep house must still pay em tax for value i had a good servant once when i was a young woman eh dear how she did grind me down into the dust in the end by heavens mercy she married the baker and i was my own woman again so said i no more good servants shall come hither a hectoring o me i just get a fool and learn her and whenever she knoweth her right hand from her left she sauceth me then out i bundle her neck and crop and take another dunce in her place dear heart tis wearisome teaching a string of fools by ones but therei am mistress here she forgot that she was defending reicht and turning rather spitefully upon her added and you be mistress here i trow no more than that stool said the van eyck loftily she is neither mistress nor servant but gone she is dismissed the house and theres an end of her what did ye not hear me turn the saucy baggage off ay ay we all heard ye said reicht with vast indifference then hear me said denys solemnly they all went round like things on wheels and fastened their eyes on him ay let us hear what the man says urged the hostess men are fine fellows with their great hoarse voices mistress reicht said denys with great dignity and ceremony indeed so great as to verge on the absurd you are turned off if on a slight acquaintance i might advise id say since you are a servant no more be a mistress a queen easier said than done replied reicht bluntly not a jot you see here one who is a man though but half an arbalestrier owing to that devilish englishmans arrow in whose carcass i have however left a like token which is a comfort i have twenty gold pieces he showed them and a stout arm in another week or so i shall have twain marriage is not a habit of mine but i capitulate to so many virtues you are beautiful goodhearted and outspoken and above all you take the part of my shecomrade be then an arbalestriesse and what the dickens is that inquired reicht i mean be the wife mistress and queen of denys of burgundy here present a dead silence fell on all it did not last long though and was followed by a burst of unreasonable indignation catherine well did you ever margaret never in all my born days catherine before our very faces margaret of all the absurdity and insolence of this ridiculous sex then denys observed somewhat drily that the female to whom he had addressed himself was mute and the others on whose eloquence there was no immediate demand were fluent on this the voices stopped and the eyes turned pivotlike upon reicht she took a sly glance from under her lashes at her military assailant and said i mean to take a good look at any man ere i leap into his arms denys drew himself up majestically then look your fill and leap away this proposal led to a new and most unexpected result a long white finger was extended by the van eyck in a line with the speakers eye and an agitated voice bade him stand in the name of all the saints you are beautiful so cried she you are inspiredwith folly what matters that you are inspired i must take off your head and in a moment she was at work with her pencil come out hussy she screamed to reicht more in front of him and keep the fool inspired and beautiful oh why had i not this maniac for my good centurion they went and brought me a brute with a low forehead and a shapeless beard catherine stood and looked with utter amazement at this pantomime and secretly resolved that her venerable hostess had been a disguised lunatic all this time and was now busy throwing off the mask as for reicht she was unhappy and cross she had left her caldron in a precarious state and made no scruple to say so and that duties so grave as hers left her no time to waste a playing the statee and the fool all at one time her mistress in reply reminded her that it was possible to be rude and rebellious to ones poor old affectionate desolate mistress without being utterly heartless and savage and a trampler on arts on this reicht stopped and pouted and looked like a little basilisk at the inspired model who caused her woe he retorted with unshaken admiration the situation was at last dissolved by the artists wrist becoming cramped from disuse this was not however until she had made a rough but noble sketch i can work no more at present said she sorrowfully then now mistress i may go and mind my pot ay ay go to your pot and get into it do you will find your soul in it so then you will all be together well but reicht said catherine laughing she turned you off boo boo boo said reicht contemptuously when she wants to get rid of me let her turn herself off and die i am sure she is old enough fort but take your time mistress if you are in no hurry no more am i when that day doth come twill take a man to dry my eyes and if you should be in the same mind then soldier you can say so and if you are not why twill be all one to reicht heynes and the plain speaker went her way but her words did not fall to the ground neither of her female hearers could disguise from herself that this blunt girl solitary herself had probably read margaret brandt aright and that she had gone away from sevenbergen brokenhearted catherine and denys bade the van eyck adieu and that same afternoon denys set out on a wild goose chase his plan like all great things was simple he should go to a hundred towns and villages and ask in each after an old physician with a fair daughter and an old longbow soldier he should inquire of the burgomasters about all newcomers and should go to the fountains and watch the women and girls as they came with their pitchers for water and away he went and was months and months on the tramp and could not find her happily this chivalrous feat of friendship was in some degree its own reward those who sit at home blindfolded by selfconceit and think camel or man out of the depths of their inner consciousness alias their ignorance will tell you that in the intervals of war and danger peace and tranquil life acquire their true value and satisfy the heroic mind but those who look before they babble or scribble will see and say that men who risk their lives habitually thirst for exciting pleasures between the acts of danger are not for innocent tranquility to this denys was no exception his whole military life had been half sparta half capua and he was too good a soldier and too good a libertine to have ever mixed either habit with the other but now for the first time he found himself mixed at peace and yet on duty for he took this latter view of his wild goose chase luckily so all these months he was a demispartan sober prudent vigilant indomitable and happy though constantly disappointed as might have been expected he flirted gigantically on the road but wasted no time about it nor in these his wanderings did he tell a single female that marriage was not one of his habits etc and so we leave him on the tramp pilgrim of friendship as his poor comrade was of love chapter xlviii catherine was in dismay when she reflected that gerard must reach home in another month at farthest more likely in a week and how should she tell him she had not even kept an eye upon his betrothed then there was the uncertainty as to the girls fate and this uncertainty sometimes took a sickening form oh kate she groaned if she should have gone and made herself away mother she would never be so wicked ah my lass you know not what hasty fools young lasses be that have no mothers to keep em straight they will fling themselves into the water for a man that the next man they meet would ha cured em of in a week i have known em to jump in like brass one moment and scream for help in the next couldnt know their own minds ye see even about such a trifle as yon and then theres times when their bodies ail like no other living creatures ever i could hear of and that strings up their feelings so the patience that belongs to them at other times beyond all living souls barring an ass seems all to jump out of em at one turn and into the water they go therefore i say that men are monsters mother monsters and no less to go making such heaps o canals just to tempt the poor women in they know we shall not cut our throats hating the sight of blood and rating our skins a hantle higher nor our lives and as for hanging while she is a fixing of the nail and a making of the noose she has time t alter her mind but a jump into a canal is no more than into bed and the water it does all the lave will ye nill ye why look at me the mother o nine wasnt i agog to make a hole in our canal for the nonce nay mother ill never believe it of you ye may though twas in the first year of our keeping house together eli hadnt found out my weak stitches then nor i his so we made a rent pulling contrariwise had a quarrel so then i ran crying to tell some gabbling fool like myself what i had no business to tell out o doors except to the saints and there was one of our precious canals in the way do they take us for teal oh how tempting it did look says i to myself sith he has let me go out of his door quarrelled he shall see me drowned next and then he will change his key he will blubber a good one and i shall look down from heaven i forgot i should be in tother part and see him take on and oh but that will be sweet and i was all a tiptoe and going in only just then i thought i wouldnt i had got a new gown a making for one thing and hard upon finished so i went home instead and what was elis first word let yon flea stick i the wall my lass says he not a word of all i said t anger thee was sooth but this i love thee these were his very words i minded em being the first quarrel so i flung my arms about his neck and sobbed a bit and thought o the canal and he was no colder to me than i to him being a man and a young one and so then that was better than lying in the water and spoiling my wedding kirtle and my fine new shoon old john bush made em that was uncle to him keeps the shop now and what was my grief to hers little kate hoped that margaret loved her father too much to think of leaving him so at his age he is father and mother and all to her you know nay kate they do forget all these things in a moment o despair when the very sky seems black above them i place more faith in him that is unborn than on him that is ripe for the grave to keep her out o mischief for certes it do go sore against us to die when theres a little innocent a pulling at our hearts to let un live and feeding at our very veins well then keep up a good heart mother she added that very likely all these fears were exaggerated she ended by solemnly entreating her mother at all events not to persist in naming the sex of margarets infant it was so unlucky all the gossips told her dear heart as if there were not as many girls born as boys this reflection though not unreasonable was met with clamour have you the cruelty to threaten me with a girl i want no more girls while i have you what use would a lass be to me can i set her on my knee and see my gerard again as i can a boy i tell thee tis all settled how may that be in my mind and if i am to be disappointed i the end tisnt for you to disappoint me beforehand telling me it is not to be a child but only a girl chapter xlix margaret brandt had always held herself apart from sevenbergen and her reserve had passed for pride this had come to her ears and she knew many hearts were swelling with jealousy and malevolence how would they triumph over her when her condition could no longer be concealed this thought gnawed her night and day for some time it had made her bury herself in the house and shun daylight even on those rare occasions when she went abroad not that in her secret heart and conscience she mistook her moral situation as my unlearned readers have done perhaps though not acquainted with the nice distinctions of the contemporary law she knew that betrothal was a marriage contract and could no more be legally broken on either side than any other compact written and witnessed and that marriage with another party than the betrothed had been formerly annulled both by church and state and that betrothed couples often came together without any further ceremony and their children were legitimate but what weighed down her simple mediaeval mind was this that very contract of betrothal was not forthcoming instead of her keeping it gerard had got it and gerard was far far away she hated and despised herself for the miserable oversight which had placed her at the mercy of false opinion for though she had never heard horaces famous couplet segnius irritant etc she was horatian by the plain hard positive intelligence which strange to say characterizes the judgment of her sex when feeling happens not to blind it altogether she gauged the understanding of the world to a t her marriage lines being out of sight and in italy would never prevail to balance her visible pregnancy and the sight of her child when born what sort of a tale was this to stop slanderous tongues i have got my marriage lines but i cannot show them you what woman would believe her or even pretend to believe her and as she was in reality one of the most modest girls in holland it was womens good opinion she wanted not mens even barefaced slander attacks her sex at a great advantage but here was slander with a face of truth the strongminded woman had not yet been invented and margaret though by nature and by having been early made mistress of a family she was resolute in some respects was weak as water in others and weakest of all in this like all the elite of her sex she was a poor little leaf trembling at each gust of the worlds opinion true or false much misery may be contained in few words i doubt if pages of description from any mans pen could make any human creature except virtuous women and these need no such aid realize the anguish of a virtuous woman foreseeing herself paraded as a frail one had she been frail at heart she might have brazened it out but she had not that advantage she was really pure as snow and saw the pitch coming nearer her and nearer the poor girl sat listless hours at a time and moaned with inner anguish and often when her father was talking to her and she giving mechanical replies suddenly her cheek would burn like fire and the old man would wonder what he had said to discompose her nothing his words were less than air to her it was the everpresent dread sent the colour of shame into her burning cheek no matter what she seemed to be talking and thinking about but both shame and fear rose to a climax when she came back that night from margaret van eycks her condition was discovered and by persons of her own sex the old artist secluded like herself might not betray her but catherine a gossip in the centre of a family and a thick neighbourhood one spark of hope remained catherine had spoken kindly even lovingly the situation admitted no half course gerards mother thus roused must either be her best friend or worst enemy she waited then in racking anxiety to hear more no word came she gave up hope catherine was not going to be her friend then she would expose her since she had no strong and kindly feeling to balance the natural love of babbling then it was the wish to fly from this neighbourhood began to grow and gnaw upon her till it became a wild and passionate desire but how persuade her father to this old people cling to places he was very old and infirm to change his abode there was no course but to make him her confidant better so than to run away from him and she felt that would be the alternative and now between her uncontrollable desire to fly and hide and her invincible aversion to speak out to a man even to her father she vibrated in a suspense full of lively torture and presently betwixt these two came in one day the fatal thought end all things foolishly worded are not always foolish one of poor catherines bugbears these numerous canals did sorely tempt this poor fluctuating girl she stood on the bank one afternoon and eyed the calm deep water it seemed an image of repose and she was so harassed no more trouble no more fear of shame if gerard had not loved her i doubt she had ended there as it was she kneeled by the water side and prayed fervently to god to keep such wicked thoughts from her oh selfish wretch said she to leave thy father oh wicked wretch to kill thy child and make thy poor gerard lose all his pain and peril undertaken for thy sight i will tell father all ay ere this sun shall set and she went home with eager haste lest her good resolution should ooze out ere she got there now in matters domestic the learned peter was simple as a child and margaret from the age of sixteen had governed the house gently but absolutely it was therefore a strange thing in this house the faltering irresolute way in which its young but despotic mistress addressed that person who in a domestic sense was less important than martin wittenhaagen or even than the little girl who came in the morning and for a pittance washed the vessels etc and went home at night father i would speak to thee speak on girl wilt listen to me andandnotand try to excuse my faults we have all our faults margaret thou no more than the rest of us but fewer unless parental feeling blinds me alas no father i am a poor foolish girl that would fain do well but have done ill most ill most unwisely and now must bear the shame but father i love you with all my faults and will not you forgive my folly and still love your motherless girl that ye may count on said peter cheerfully oh well smile not for then how can i speak and make you sad why what is the matter father disgrace is coming on this house it is at the door and i the culprit oh father turn your head away iifather i have let gerard take away my marriage lines is that all twas an oversight twas the deed of a mad woman but woe is me that is not the worst peter interrupted her the youth is honest and loves you dear you are young what is a year or two to you gerard will assuredly come back and keep troth and meantime know you what is coming not i except that i shall be gone first for one worse than that there is worse pain than death nay for pitys sake turn away your head father foolish wench muttered peter but turned his head she trembled violently and with her cheeks on fire began to falter out i did look on gerard as my husbandwe being betrothedand he was in so sore danger and i thought i had killed him and ioh if you were but my mother i might find courage you would question me but you say not a word why margaret what is all this coil about and why are thy cheeks crimson speaking to no stranger but to thy old father why are my cheeks on fire becausebecausefather kill me send me to heaven bid martin shoot me with his arrow and then the gossips will come and tell you why i blush so this day and then when i am dead i hope you will love your girl again for her mothers sake give me thy hand mistress said peter a little sternly she put it out to him trembling he took it gently and began with some anxiety in his face to feel her pulse alas nay said she tis my soul that burns not my body with fever i cannot will not bide in sevenbergen and she wrung her hands impatiently be calm now said the old man soothingly nor torment thyself for nought not bide in sevenbergen what need to bide a day as it vexes thee and puts thee in a fever for fevered thou art deny it not what cried margaret would you yield to go hence andand ask no reason but my longing to be gone and suddenly throwing herself on her knees beside him in a fervour of supplication she clutched his sleeve and then his arm and then his shoulder while imploring him to quit this place and not ask her why alas what needs it you will soon see it and i could never say it i would liever die foolish child who seeks thy girlish secrets is it i whose life hath been spent in searching natures and for leaving sevenbergen what is there to keep me in it thee unwilling is there respect for me here or gratitude am i not yclept quacksalver by those that come not near me and wizard by those i heal and give they not the guerdon and the honour they deny me to the empirics that slaughter them besides what ist to me where we sojourn choose thou that as did thy mother before thee margaret embraced him tenderly and wept upon his shoulder she was respited yet as she wept respited she almost wished she had had the courage to tell him after a while nothing would content him but her taking a medicament he went and brought her she took it submissively to please him it was the least she could do it was a composing draught and though administered under an error and a common one did her more good than harm she awoke calmed by a long sleep and that very day began her preparations next week they went to rotterdam bag and baggage and lodged above a tailors shop in the bredekirk straet only one person in tergou knew whither they were gone the burgomaster he locked the information in his own breast the use he made of it ere long my reader will not easily divine for he did not divine it himself but time will show chapter l among strangers margaret brandt was comparatively happy and soon a new and unexpected cause of content arose a civic dignitary being ill and fanciful in proportion went from doctor to doctor and having arrived at deaths door sent for peter peter found him bled and purged to nothing he flung a battalion of bottles out of window and left it open beat up yolks of eggs in neat schiedam and administered it in small doses followed this up by meat stewed in red wine and water shredding into both mild febrifugal herbs that did no harm finally his patient got about again looking something between a man and a pillowcase and being a voluble dignitary spread peters fame in every street and that artist who had long merited a reputation in vain made one rapidly by luck things looked bright the old mans pride was cheered at last and his purse began to fill he spent much of his gain however in sovereign herbs and choice drugs and would have so invested them all but margaret whitemailed a part the victory came too late its happy excitement was fatal one evening in bidding her goodnight his voice seemed rather inarticulate the next morning he was found speechless and only just sensible margaret who had been for years her fathers attentive pupil saw at once that he had had a paralytic stroke but not trusting to herself she ran for a doctor one of those who obstructed by peter had not killed the civic dignitary came and cheerfully confirmed her views he was for bleeding the patient she declined he was always against blooding said she especially the old peter lived but was never the same man again his memory became much affected and of course he was not to be trusted to prescribe and several patients had come and one or two that were bent on being cured by the new doctor and no other awaited his convalescence misery stared her in the face she resolved to go for advice and comfort to her cousin william johnson from whom she had hitherto kept aloof out of pride and poverty she found him and his servant sitting in the same room and neither of them the better for liquor mastering all signs of surprise she gave her greetings and presently told him she had come to talk on a family matter and with this glanced quietly at the servant by way of hint the woman took it but not as expected oh you can speak before me can she not my old man at this familiarity margaret turned very red and said i cry you mercy mistress i knew not my cousin had fallen into the custom of this town well i must take a fitter opportunity and she rose to go i wot not what ye mean by custom o the town said the woman bouncing up but this i know tis the part of a faithful servant to keep her master from being preyed on by his beggarly kin margaret retorted ye are too modest mistress ye are no servant your speech betrays you tis not till the ape hath mounted the tree that she shows her tail so plain nay there sits the servant god help him and while so it is fear not thou his kin will ever be so poor in spirit as come where the likes of you can flout their dole and casting one look of mute reproach at her cousin for being so little of a man as to sit passive and silent all this time she turned and went haughtily out nor would she shed a single tear till she got home and thought of it and now here were two men to be lodged and fed by one pregnant girl and another mouth coming into the world but this last though the most helpless of all was their best friend nature was strong in margaret brandt that same nature which makes the brutes the birds and the insects so cunning at providing food and shelter for their progeny yet to come stimulated by nature she sat and brooded and brooded and thought and thought how to be beforehand with destitution ay though she had still five gold pieces left she saw starvation coming with inevitable foot her sex when deviating from custom it thinks with male intensity thinks just as much to the purpose as we do she rose bade martin move peter to another room made her own very neat and clean polished the glass globe and suspended it from the ceiling dusted the crocodile and nailed him to the outside wall and after duly instructing martin set him to play the lounging sentinel about the street door and tell the crocodilebitten that a great and aged and learned alchymist abode there who in his moments of recreation would sometimes amuse himself by curing mortal diseases patients soon came and were received by margaret and demanded to see the leech that might not be he was deep in his studies searching for the grand elixir and not princes could have speech of him they must tell her their symptoms and return in two hours and oh mysterious powers when they did return the drug or draught was always ready for them sometimes when it was a worshipful patient she would carefully scan his face and feeling both pulse and skin as well as hearing his story would go softly with it to peters room and there think and ask herself how her father whose system she had long quietly observed would have treated the case then she would write an illegible scrawl with a cabalistic letter and bring it down reverently and show it the patient and could he read that then it would be either i am no reader or with admiration nay mistress nought can i make ont ay but i can tis sovereign look on thyself as cured if she had the materials by her and she was too good an economist not to favour somewhat those medicines she had in her own stock she would sometimes let the patient see her compound it often and anxiously consulting the sacred prescription lest great science should suffer in her hands and so she would send them away relieved of cash but with their pockets full of medicine and minds full of faith and humbugged to their hearts content populus vult decipi and when they were gone she would take down two little boxes gerard had made her and on one of these she had written today and on the other tomorrow and put the smaller coins into today and the larger into tomorrow along with such of her gold pieces as had survived the journey from sevenbergen and the expenses of housekeeping in a strange place and so she met current expenses and laid by for the rainy day she saw coming and mixed drugs with simples and vice with virtue on this last score her conscience pricked her sore and after each days comedy she knelt down and prayed god to forgive her for the sake of her child but lo and behold cure and cure was reported to her so then her conscience began to harden martin wittenhaagen had of late been a dead weight on her hands like most men who had endured great hardships he had stiffened rather suddenly but though less supple he was as strong as ever and at his own pace could have carried the doctor herself round rotterdam city he carried her slops instead in this new business he showed the qualities of a soldier unreasoning obedience punctuality accuracy despatch and drunkenness he fell among good fellows the blackguards plied him with schiedam he babbled he bragged doctor margaret had risen very high in his estimation all this brandishing of a crocodile for a standard and setting a dotard in ambush and getting rid of slops and taking good money in exchange struck him not as science but something far superior strategy and he boasted in his cups and before a mixed company how me and my general we are a biting of the burghers when this revelation had had time to leaven the city his general doctor margaret received a call from the constables they took her trembling and begging subordinate machines to forgive her before the burgomaster and by his side stood real physicians a terrible row in long robes and square caps accusing her of practising unlawfully on the bodies of the dukes lieges at first she was too frightened to say a word novice like the very name of law paralyzed her but being questioned closely but not so harshly as if she had been ugly she told the truth she had long been her fathers pupil and had but followed his system and she had cured many and it is not for myself in very deed sirs but i have two poor helpless honest men at home upon my hands and how else can i keep them ah good sirs let a poor girl make her bread honestly ye hinder them not to make it idly and shamefully and oh sirs ye are husbands ye are fathers ye cannot but see i have reason to work and provide as best i may and ere this womans appeal had left her lips she would have given the world to recall it and stood with one hand upon her heart and one before her face hiding it but not the tears that trickled underneath it all which went to the wrong address perhaps a female bailiff might have yielded to such arguments and bade her practise medicine and break law till such time as her child should be weaned and no longer what have we to do with that said the burgomaster save and except that if thou wilt pledge thyself to break the law no more i will remit the imprisonment and exact but the fine on this doctor margaret clasped her hands together and vowed most penitently never never never to cure body or beast again and being dismissed with the constables to pay the fine she turned at the door and curtsied poor soul and thanked the gentlemen for their forbearance and to pay the fine the tomorrow box must be opened on the instant and with excess of caution she had gone and nailed it up that no slight temptation might prevail to open it and now she could not draw the nails and the constables grew impatient and doubted its contents and said let us break it for you but she would not let them ye will break it worse than i shall and she took a hammer and struck too faintly and lost all strength for a minute and wept hysterically and at last she broke it and a little cry bubbled from her when it broke and she paid the fine and it took all her unlawful gains and two gold pieces to boot and when the men were gone she drew the broken pieces of the box and what little money they had left her all together on the table and her arms went round them and her rich hair escaped and fell down all loose and she bowed her forehead on the wreck and sobbed my loves box it is broken and my heart withal and so remained and martin wittenhaagen came in and she could not lift her head but sighed out to him what had befallen her ending my love his box is broken and so mine heart is broken and martin was not so sad as wroth some traitor had betrayed him what stony heart had told and brought her to this pass whoever it was should feel his arrows point the curious attitude in which he must deliver the shaft never occurred to him idle chat idle chat moaned margaret without lifting her brow from the table when you have slain all the gossips in this town can we eat them tell me how to keep you all or prithee hold thy peace and let the saints get leave to whisper me martin held his tongue and cast uneasy glances at his defeated general towards evening she rose and washed her face and did up her hair and doggedly bade martin take down the crocodile and put out a basket instead i can get up linen better than they seem to do it in this street said she and you must carry it in the basket that will i for thy sake said the soldier good martin forgive me that i spake shrewishly to thee even while they were talking came a male for advice margaret told it the mayor had interfered and forbidden her to sell drugs but said she i will gladly iron and starch your linen for you and i will come and fetch it from your house are ye mad young woman said the male i come for a leech and ye proffer me a washerwoman and it went out in dudgeon there is a stupid creature said margaret sadly presently came a female to tell the symptoms of her sick child margaret stopped it we are forbidden by the bailiff to sell drugs but i will gladly wash iron and starch your linen for youandi will come and fetch it from your house oh ay said the female well i have some smocks and ruffs foul come for them and when you are there you can look at the boy and it told her where it lived and when its husband would be out yet it was rather fond of its husband than not an introduction is an introduction and two or three patients out of all those who came and were denied medicine made doctor margaret their washerwoman now martin you must help ill no more cats than can slay mice mistress the stomach is not awanting fort but the headpiece worst luck oh i mean not the starching and ironing that takes a woman and a handy one but the bare washing a man can surely contrive that why a mule has wit enough ins head to dot with his hoofs an ye could drive him into the tub come off doublet and try i am your man said the brave old soldier stripping for the unwonted toil ill risk my arm in soapsuds an you will risk your glory my what your glory and honour as awasherwoman gramercy if you are man enough to bring me halfwashed linen t iron i am woman enough to flingt back i the suds and so the brave girl and the brave soldier worked with a will and kept the wolf from the door more they could not do margaret had repaired the tomorrow box and as she leaned over the glue her tears mixed with it and she cemented her exiled lovers box with them at which a smile is allowable but an intelligent smile tipped with pity please and not the empty guffaw of the nineteenthcenturyjackass burlesquing bibles and making fun of all things except fun but when mended it stood unreplenished they kept the weekly rent paid and the pot boiling but no more and now came a concatenation recommended from one to another margaret washed for the mayor and bringing home the clean linen one day she heard in the kitchen that his worships only daughter was stricken with disease and not like to live poor margaret could not help crossquestioning and a female servant gave her such of the symptoms as she had observed but they were too general however one gossip would add one fact and another another and margaret pondered them all at last one day she met the mayor himself he recognized her directly why you are the unlicensed doctor i was said she but now im your worships washerwoman the dignitary coloured and said that was rather a come down nay i bear no malice for your worship might have been harder rather would i do you a good turn sir you have a sick daughter let me see her the mayor shook his head that cannot be the law i do enforce on others i may not break myself margaret opened her eyes alack sir i seek no guerdon now for curing folk why i am a washerwoman i trow one may heal all the world an if one will but let the world starve one in return that is no more than just said the mayor he added an ye make no trade ont there is no offence then let me see her what avails it the learnedest leeches in rotterdam have all seen her and bettered her nought her ill is inscrutable one skilled wight saith spleen another liver another blood another stomach and another that she is possessed and in very truth she seems to have a demon shunneth all company pineth alone eateth no more victuals than might diet a sparrow speaketh seldom nor hearkens them that speak and weareth thinner and paler and nearer and nearer the grave welladay sir said margaret an if you take your velvet doublet to halfadozen of shops in rotterdam and speer is this fine or sorry velvet and worth how much the ell those six traders will eye it and feel it and all be in one story to a letter and why because they know their trade and your leeches are all in different stories why because they know not their trade i have heard my father say each is enamoured of some one evil and seeth it with his bats eye in every patient had they stayed at home and never seen your daughter they had answered all the same spleen blood stomach lungs liver lunacy or as they call it possession let me see her we are of a sex and that is much and when he still hesitated saints of heaven cried she giving way to the irritability of a breeding woman is this how men love their own flesh and blood her mother had taen me in her arms ere this and carried me to the sick room and two violet eyes flashed fire come with me said the mayor hastily mistress i have brought thee a new doctor the person addressed a pale young girl of eighteen gave a contemptuous wrench of her shoulder and turned more decidedly to the fire she was sitting over margaret came softly and sat beside her but tis one that will not torment you a woman exclaimed the young lady with surprise and some contempt tell her your symptoms what for you will be no wiser you will be none the worse well i have no stomach for food and no heart for any thing now cure me and go patience awhile your food is it tasteless like in your mouth ay how knew you that nay i knew it not till you did tell me i trow you would be better for a little good company i trow not what is their silly chat to me here margaret requested the father to leave them alone and in his absence put some practical questions then she reflected when you wake i the morning you find yourself quiver as one may say nay ay how knew you that shall i dose you or shall i but tease you a bit with my silly chat which you will then i will tell you a story tis about two true lovers i hate to hear of lovers said the girl nevertheless canst tell me twill be less nauseous than your physicmaybe margaret then told her a love story the maiden was a girl called ursel and the youth one conrad she an old physicians daughter he the son of a hosier at tergou she told their adventures their troubles their sad condition she told it from the female point of view and in a sweet and winning and earnest voice that by degrees soon laid hold of this sullen heart and held it breathless and when she broke it off her patient was much disappointed nay nay i must hear the end i will hear it ye cannot for i know it not none knoweth that but god ah your ursel was a jewel of worth said the girl earnestly would she were here instead of her that is here i say not that and she blushed a little you do but think it thought is free whether or no an she were here id give her a buss poor thing then give it me for i am she nay nay that ill be sworn y are not say not so in very truth i am she and prithee sweet mistress go not from your word but give me the buss ye promised me and with a good heart for oh my own heart lies heavy heavy as thine sweet mistress the young gentlewoman rose and put her arms round margarets neck and kissed her i am woe for you she sighed you are a good soul you have done me gooda little a gulp came in her throat come again come again margaret did come again and talked with her and gently but keenly watched what topics interested her and found there was but one then she said to the mayor i know your daughters trouble and tis curable what ist the blood nay the stomach nay the liver nay the foul fiend nay what then love love stuff impossible she is but a child she never stirs abroad unguarded she never hath from a child all the better then we shall not have far to look for him i vow not i shall but command her to tell me the caitiffs name that hath by magic arts ensnared her young affections oh how foolish be the wise said margaret what would ye go and put her on her guard nay let us work by art first and if that fails then twill still be time for violence and folly margaret then with some difficulty prevailed on the mayor to take advantage of its being saturday and pay all his people their salaries in his daughters presence and hers it was done some fifteen people entered the room and received their pay with a kind word from their employer then margaret who had sat close to the patient all the time rose and went out the mayor followed her sir how call you yon blackhaired lad that is ulrich my clerk well then tis he now heaven forbid a lad i took out of the streets well but your worship is an understanding man you took him not up without some merit of his merit not a jot i liked the looks of the brat that was all was that no merit he pleased the fathers eye and now who had pleased the daughters that has oft been seen since adam how know ye tis he i held her hand and with my finger did lightly touch her wrist and when the others came and went twas as if dogs and cats had fared in and out but at this ulrichs coming her pulse did leap and her eye shine and when he went she did sink back and sigh and twas to be seen the sun had gone out of the room for her nay burgomaster look not on me so scared no witch or magician i but a poor girl that hath been docile and so bettered herself by a great neglected leechs art and learning i tell ye all this hath been done before thousands of years ere we were born now bide thou there till i come to thee and prithee prithee spoil not good work wi meddling she then went back and asked her patient for a lock of her hair take it said she more listlessly than ever why tis a lass of marble how long do you count to be like that mistress till i am in my grave sweet peggy who knows maybe in ten minutes you will be altogether as hot she ran into the shop but speedily returned to the mayor and said good news he fancies her and more than a little now how ist to be will you marry your child or bury her for there is no third way for shame and love they do rend her virgin heart to death the dignitary decided for the more cheerful rite but not without a struggle and with its marks on his face he accompanied margaret to his daughter but as men are seldom in a hurry to drink their wormwood he stood silent so doctor margaret said cheerfully mistress your lock is gone i have sold it and who was so mad as to buy such a thing inquired the young lady scornfully oh a blackhaired laddie wi white teeth they call him ulrich the pale face reddened directly brow and all says he oh sweet mistress give it me i had told them all whose twas nay said i selling is my livelihood not giving so he offered me this he offered me that but nought less would i take than his next quarters wages cruel murmured the girl scarce audibly why you are in one tale with your father says he to me when i told him oh an he loves her hair so well tis odd but he loves the rest of her well quoth he tis an honest lad and a shall have her gien she will but leave her sulks and consent so what say ye mistress will you be married to ulrich or buried i the kirkyard father father tis so girl speak thy mind i will obey my fatherin all things stammered the poor girl trying hard to maintain the advantageous position in which margaret had placed her but nature and the joy and surprise were too strong even for a virgins bashful cunning she cast an eloquent look on them both and sank at her fathers knees and begged his pardon with many sobs for having doubted his tenderness he raised her in his arms and took her radiant through her tears with joy and returning life and filial love to his breast and the pair passed a truly sacred moment and the dignitary was as happy as he thought to be miserable so hard is it for mortals to foresee and they looked round for margaret but she had stolen away softly the young girl searched the house for her where is she hid where on earth is she where was she why in her own house dressing meat for her two old children and crying bitterly the while at the living picture of happiness she had just created welladay the odds between her lot and mine welladay next time she met the dignitary he hemmd and hawed and remarked what a pity it was the law forbade him to pay her who had cured his daughter however when all is done twas not art twas but womans wit nought but that burgomaster said margaret bitterly pay the men of art for not curing her all the guerdon i seek that cured her is this go not and give your foul linen away from me by way of thanks why should i inquired he marry because there be fools about ye will tell ye she that hath wit to cure dark diseases cannot have wit to take dirt out o rags so pledge me your faith the dignitary promised pompously and felt all the patron something must be done to fill tomorrows box she hawked her initial letters and her illuminated vellums all about the town printing had by this time dealt caligraphy in black and white a terrible blow in holland and germany but some copies of the printed books were usually illuminated and fettered the printers offered margaret prices for work in these two kinds ill think ont said she she took down her diurnal book and calculated that the price of an hours work on those arts would be about onefifth what she got for an hour at the tub and mangle ill starve first said she what pay a craft and a mystery five times less than a handicraft martin carrying the dry clothesbasket got treated and drunk this time he babbled her whole story the girls got hold of it and gibed her at the fountain all she had gone through was light to her compared with the pins and bodkins her own sex drove into her heart whenever she came near the merry crew with her pitcher and that was every day each sex has its form of cruelty mans is more brutal and terrible but shallow women that have neither read nor suffered have an unmuscular barbarity of their own where no feeling of sex steps in to overpower it this defect intellectual perhaps rather than moral has been mitigated in our day by books especially by able works of fiction for there are two roads to the highest effort of intelligence pity experience of sorrows and imagination by which alone we realize the grief we never felt in the fifteenth century girls with pitchers had but one experience and at sixteen years of age or so that road had scarce been trodden these girls persisted that margaret was deserted by her lover and to be deserted was a crime they had not been deserted yet not a word against the gerard they had created out of their own heads for the imaginary crime they fell foul of the supposed victim sometimes they affronted her to her face oftener they talked at her backwards and forwards with a subtle skill and a perseverance which oh that they had bestowed on the arts as poor aguecheek says now margaret was brave and a coward brave to battle difficulties and ill fortune brave to shed her own blood for those she loved fortitude she had but she had no true fighting courage she was a powerful young woman rather tall full and symmetrical yet had one of those slips of girls slapped her face the poor fools hands would have dropped powerless or gone to her own eyes instead of her adversarys nor was she even a match for so many tongues and besides what could she say she knew nothing of these girls except that somehow they had found out her sorrows and hated her only she thought to herself they must be very happy or they would not be so hard on her so she took their taunts in silence and all her struggle was not to let them see their power to make her writhe within here came in her fortitude and she received their blows with wellfeigned icy hauteur they slapped a statue but one day when her spirits were weak as happens at times to females in her condition a dozen assailants followed suit so admirably that her whole sex seemed to the dispirited one to be against her and she lost heart and the tears began to run silently at each fresh stab on this their triumph knew no bounds and they followed her half way home casting barbed speeches after that exposure of weakness the statue could be assumed no more so then she would stand timidly aloof out of tongueshot till her young tyrants pitchers were all filled and they gone and then creep up with hers and one day she waited so long that the fount had ceased to flow so the next day she was obliged to face the phalanx or her house go dry she drew near slowly but with the less tremor that she saw a man at the well talking to them he would distract their attention and besides they would keep their foul tongues quiet if only to blind the male to their real character this conjecture though shrewd was erroneous they could not all flirt with that one man so the outsiders indemnified themselves by talking at her the very moment she came up any news from foreign parts jacqueline none for me martha my lad goes no farther from me than the town wall i cant say as much says a third but if he goes t italy i have got another ready to take the fools place hell not go thither lass they go not so far till they are sick of us that bide in holland surprise and indignation and the presence of a man gave margaret a moments fighting courage oh flout me not and show your ill nature before the very soldier in heavens name what ill did i ever to ye what harsh word cast back for all you have flung on me a desolate stranger in your cruel town that ye flout me for my bereavement and my poor lads most unwilling banishment hearts of flesh would surely pity us both for that ye cast in my teeth these many days ye brows of brass ye bosoms of stone they stared at this novelty resistance and ere they could recover and make mincement of her she put her pitcher quietly down and threw her coarse apron over her head and stood there grieving her shortlived spirit oozing fast hallo cried the soldier why what is your ill she made no reply but a little girl who had long secretly hated the big ones squeaked out they did flout her they are aye flouting her she may not come nigh the fountain for fear o them and tis a black shame who spoke to her not i for one nor i i would not bemean myself so far the man laughed heartily at this display of dignity come wife said he never lower thy flag to such light skirmishers as these hast a tongue i thy head as well as they alack good soldier i was not bred to bandy foul terms well but hast a better arm than these why not take em by twos across thy knee and skelp em till they cry meculpee nay i would not hurt their bodies for all their cruel hearts then ye must een laugh at them wife what a woman grown and not see why mesdames give tongue you are a buxom wife they are a bundle of threadpapers you are fair and fresh they have all the dutch rim under their bright eyes that comes of dwelling in eternal swamps there lies your crime come gie me thy pitcher and if they flout me shalt see me scrub em all wi my beard till they squeak holy mother the pitcher was soon filled and the soldier put it in margarets hand she murmured thank you kindly brave soldier he patted her on the shoulder come courage brave wife the divell is dead she let the heavy pitcher fall on his foot directly he cursed horribly and hopped in a circle saying no the thiefs alive and has broken my great toe the apron came down and there was a lovely face all flushed with emotion and two beaming eyes in front of him and two hands held out clasped nay nay tis nought said he goodhumouredly mistaking denys wellbuthallo how know you my name is denys of burgundy why ods bodikins i know you not and you know me by gerards letter crossbow beard handsome the divell is dead sword of goliah this must be she red hair violet eyes lovely face but i took ye for a married wife seeing ye tell me my name said she quickly margaret brandt gerard where is he is he in life is he well is he coming is he come why is he not here where have ye left him oh tell me prithee prithee prithee tell me ay ay but not here oh ye are all curiosity now mesdames eh lass i have been three months afoot travelling all holland to find ye and here you are oh be joyful and he flung his cap in the air and seizing both her hands kissed them ardently ah my pretty shecomrade i have found thee at last i knew i should shall be flouted no more ill twist your necks at the first word ye little trollops and i have got fifteen gold angels left for thee and our gerard will soon be here shalt wet thy purple eyes no more but the fair eyes were wet even now looking kindly and gratefully at the friend that had dropped among her foes as if from heaven gerards comrade prithee come home with me good kind denys i cannot speak of him before these they went off together followed by a chorus she has gotten a man she has gotten a man at last boo boo boo margaret quickened her steps but denys took down his crossbow and pretended to shoot them all dead they fled quadrivious shrieking chapter li the reader already knows how much these two had to tell one another it was a sweet yet bitter day for margaret since it brought her a true friend and ill news for now first she learned that gerard was all alone in that strange land she could not think with denys that he would come home indeed he would have arrived before this denys was a balm he called her his shecomrade and was always cheering her up with his formula and hilarities and she petted him and made much of him and feebly hectored it over him as well as over martin and would not let him eat a single meal out of her house and forbade him to use naughty words it spoils you denys good lack to hear such ugly words come forth so comely a head forbear or i shall be angry so be civil whereupon denys was upon his good behaviour and ludicrous the struggle between his native politeness and his acquired ruffianism and as it never rains but it pours other persons now solicited margarets friendship she had written to margaret van eyck a humble letter telling her she knew she was no longer the favourite she had been and would keep her distance but could not forget her benefactresss past kindness she then told her briefly how many ways she had battled for a living and in conclusion begged earnestly that her residence might not be betrayed least of all to his people i do hate them they drove him from me and even when he was gone their hearts turned not to me as they would an if they had repented their cruelty to him the van eyck was perplexed at last she made a confidante of reicht the secret ran through reicht as through a cylinder to catherine ay and is she turned that bitter against us said that good woman she stole our son from us and now she hates us for not running into her arms natheless it is a blessing she is alive and no farther away than rotterdam the english princess now countess charolois made a stately progress through the northern states of the duchy accompanied by her stepdaughter the young heiress of burgundy marie de bourgogne then the old duke the most magnificent prince in europe put out his splendour troops of dazzling knights and bevies of fair ladies gorgeously attired attended the two princesses and minstrels jongleurs or storytellers bards musicians actors tumblers followed in the train and there was fencing dancing and joy in every town they shone on richart invited all his people to meet him at rotterdam and view the pageant they had been in rotterdam some days when denys met catherine accidentally in the street and after a warm greeting on both sides bade her rejoice for he had found the shecomrade and crowed but catherine cooled him by showing him how much earlier he would have found her by staying quietly at tergou than by vagabondizing it all over holland and being found what the better are we her heart is set dead against us now oh let that flea stick come you with me to her house no she would not go where she was sure of an ill welcome them that come unbidden sit unseated no let denys be mediator and bring the parties to a good understanding he undertook the office at once and with great pomp and confidence he trotted off to margaret and said shecomrade i met this day a friend of thine thou didst look into the rotter then and see thyself nay twas a female and one that seeks thy regard twas catherine gerards mother oh was it said margaret then you may tell her she comes too late there was a time i longed and longed for her but she held aloof in my hour of most need so now we will be as we ha been denys tried to shake this resolution he coaxed her but she was bitter and sullen and not to be coaxed then he scolded her well then at that she went into hysterics he was frightened at this result of his eloquence and being off his guard allowed himself to be entrapped into a solemn promise never to recur to the subject he went back to catherine crestfallen and told her she fired up and told the family how his overtures had been received then they fired up it became a feud and burned fiercer every day little kate alone made some excuses for margaret the very next day another visitor came to margaret and found the military enslaved and degraded martin up to his elbows in soapsuds and denys ironing very clumsily and margaret plaiting ruffs but with a mistresss eye on her raw levies to these there entered an old man venerable at first sight but on nearer view keen and wizened ah cried margaret then swiftly turned her back on him and hid her face with invincible repugnance oh that man that man nay fear me not said ghysbrecht i come on a friends errand i bring ye a letter from foreign parts mock me not old man and she turned slowly round nay see and he held out an enormous letter margaret darted on it and held it with trembling hands and glistening eyes it was gerards handwriting oh thank you sir bless you for this i forgive you all the ill you ever wrought me and she pressed the letter to her bosom with one hand and glided swiftly from the room with it as she did not come back ghysbrecht went away but not without a scowl at martha margaret was hours alone with her letter chapter li when she came down again she was a changed woman her eyes were wet but calm and all her bitterness and excitement charmed away denys said she softly i have got my orders i am to read my lovers letter to his folk ye will never do that ay will i i see there is something in the letter has softened ye towards them not a jot denys not a jot but an i hated them like poison i would not disobey my love denys tis so sweet to obey and sweetest of all to obey one who is far far away and cannot enforce my duty but must trust my love for my obedience ah gerard my darling at hand i might have slighted thy commands misliking thy folk as i have cause to do but now didst bid me go into the raging sea and read thy sweet letter to the sharks there id go therefore denys tell his mother i have got a letter and if she and hers would hear it i am their servant let them say their hour and ill seat them as best i can and welcome them as best i may denys went off to catherine with this good news he found the family at dinner and told them there was a long letter from gerard then in the midst of the joy this caused he said and her heart is softened and she will read it to you herself you are to choose your own time what does she think there are none can read but her asked catherine let her send the letter and we will read it nay but mother objected little kate mayhap she cannot bear to part it from her hand she loves him dearly what thinks she we shall steal it cornelis suggested that she would fain wedge herself into the family by means of this letter denys cast a look of scorn on the speaker there spoke a bad heart said he la camarade hates you all like poison oh mistake me not dame i defend her not but so tis yet maugre her spleen at a word from gerard she proffers to read you his letter with her own pretty mouth and hath a voice like honeysure tis a fair proffer tis so mine honest soldier said the father of the family and merits a civil reply therefore hold your whisht ye that be women and i shall answer her tell her i his father setting aside all past grudges do for this grace thank her and would she have double thanks let her send my sons letter by thy faithful hand the which will i read to his flesh and blood and will then to her so surely and faithful return as i am eli a dierich a william a luke free burgher of tergou like my forbears and like them a man of my word ay and a man who is better than his word cried catherine the only one i ever did foregather hold thy peace wife art a man of sense eli a dirk a chose a chose shouted denys the shecomrade will be right glad to obey gerard and yet not face you all whom she hates as wormwood saving your presence bless ye the world hath changed she is all submission today obedience is honey quoth she and in sooth tis a sweetmeat she cannot but savour eating so little ont for what with her fair face and her mellow tongue and what wi flying in fits and terrifying us that be soldiers to death an we thwart her and what wi chiding us one while and petting us like lambs t other she hath made two of the crawlingest slaves ever you saw out of two honest swashbucklers i be the ironing ruffian t other washes what next what next why whenever the brat is in the world i shall rock cradle and t other knave will wash tucker and bib so then ill go fetch the letter on the instant ye will let me bide and hear it read will ye not else our hearts were black as coal said catherine so denys went for the letter he came back crestfallen she will not let it out of her hand neither to me nor you nor any he or she that lives i knew she would not said cornelis whisht whisht said eli and let denys tell his story nay said i but be ruled by me not i quoth she well but quoth i that same honey obedience ye spake of you are a fool says she obedience to gerard is sweet but obedience to any other body who ever said that was sweet at last she seemed to soften a bit and did give me a written paper for you mademoiselle here tis for me said little kate colouring give that here said eli and he scanned the writing and said almost in a whisper these be words from the letter hearken and sweetheart an if these lines should travel safe to thee make thou trial of my peoples hearts withal maybe they are somewhat turned towards me being far away if tis so they will show it to thee since now to me they may not read then this letter but i do strictly forbid thee to let it from thy hand and if they still hold aloof from thee why then say nought but let them think me dead obey me in this for if thou dost disrespect my judgment and my will in this thou lovest me not there was a silence and gerards words copied by margaret here handed round and inspected well said catherine that is another matter but methinks tis for her to come to us not we to her alas mother what odds does that make much said eli tell her we are over many to come to her and bid her hither the sooner the better when denys was gone eli owned it was a bitter pill to him when that lass shall cross my threshold all the mischief and misery she hath made here will seem to come in adoors in one heap but what could i do wife we must hear the news of gerard i saw that in thine eyes and felt it in my own heart and she is backed by our undutiful but still beloved son and so is she stronger than we and brings our noses down to the grindstone the sly cruel jade but never heed we will hear the letter and then let her go unblessed as she came unwelcome make your mind easy said catherine she will not come at all and a tone of regret was visible shortly after richart who had been hourly expected arrived from amsterdam grave and dignified in his burghers robe and gold chain ruff and furred cap and was received not with affection only but respect for he had risen a step higher than his parents and such steps were marked in mediaeval society almost as visibly as those in their staircases admitted in due course to the family council he showed plainly though not discourteously that his pride was deeply wounded by their having deigned to treat with margaret brandt i see the temptation said he but which of us hath not at times to wish one way and do another this threw a considerable chill over the old people so little kate put in a word vex not thyself dear richart mother says she will not come all the better sweetheart i fear me if she do i shall hie me back to amsterdam here denys popped his head in at the door and said she will be here at three on the great dial they all looked at one another in silence anglice a thingembob chapter liii nay richart said catherine at last for heavens sake let not this one sorry wench set us all by the ears hath she not made ill blood enough already in very deed she hath fear me not good mother let her come and read the letter of the poor boy she hath by devilish arts bewitched and then let her go give me your words to show her no countenance beyond decent and constrained civility less we may not being in our own house and i will say no more on this understanding they waited the foe she for her part prepared for the interview in a spirit little less hostile when denys brought word they would not come to her but would receive her her lip curled and she bade him observe how in them every feeling however small was larger than the love for gerard well said she i have not that excuse so why mimic the pretty burghers pride the pride of all unlettered folk i will go to them for gerards sake oh how i loathe them thus poor goodnatured denys was bringing into one house the materials of an explosion margaret made her toilet in the same spirit that a knight of her day dressed for battlehe to parry blows and she to parry glancesglances of contempt at her poverty or of irony at her extravagance her kirtle was of english cloth dark blue and her farthingale and hose of the same material but a glossy roan or claret colour not an inch of pretentious fur about her but plain snowy linen wristbands and curiously plaited linen from the bosom of the kirtle up to the commencement of the throat it did not encircle her throat but framed it being square not round her front hair still peeped in two waves much after the fashion which mary queen of scots revived a century later but instead of the silver net which would have ill become her present condition the rest of her head was covered with a very small tightfitting hood of dark blue cloth hemmed with silver her shoes were red but the roan petticoat and hose prepared the spectators mind for the shock and they set off the arched instep and shapely foot beauty knew its business then as now and with all this she kept her enemies waiting though it was three by the dial at last she started attended by her hecomrade and when they were halfway she stopped and said thoughtfully denys well shegeneral i must go home piteously what have ye left somewhat behind what my courage oh oh oh nay nay be brave shegeneral i shall be with you ay but wilt keep close to me when i be there denys promised and she resumed her march but gingerly meantime they were all assembled and waiting for her with a strange mixture of feelings mortification curiosity panting affection aversion to her who came to gratify those feelings yet another curiosity to see what she was like and what there was in her to bewitch gerard and make so much mischief at last denys came alone and whispered the shecomrade is without fetch her in said eli now whisht all of ye none speak to her but i they all turned their eyes to the door in dead silence a little muttering was heard outside denyss rough organ and a womans soft and mellow voice presently that stopped and then the door opened slowly and margaret brandt dressed as i have described and somewhat pale but calm and lovely stood on the threshold looking straight before her they all rose but kate and remained mute and staring be seated mistress said eli gravely and motioned to a seat that had been set apart for her she inclined her head and crossed the apartment and in so doing her condition was very visible not only in her shape but in her languor cornelis and sybrandt hated her for it richart thought it spoiled her beauty it softened the women somewhat she took her letter out of her bosom and kissed it as if she had been alone then disposed herself to read it with the air of one who knew she was there for that single purpose but as she began she noticed they had seated her all by herself like a leper she looked at denys and putting her hand down by her side made him a swift furtive motion to come by her he went with an obedient start as if she had cried march and stood at her shoulder like a sentinel but this zealous manner of doing it revealed to the company that he had been ordered thither and at that she coloured and now she began to read her gerard their gerard to their eager ears in a mellow clear voice so soft so earnest so thrilling her very soul seemed to cling about each precious sound it was a voice as of a womans bosom set speaking by heaven itself i do nothing doubt my margaret that long ere this shall meet thy beloved eyes denys my most dear friend will have sought thee out and told thee the manner of our unlooked for and most tearful parting therefore i will een begin at that most doleful day what befell him after poor faithful soul fain fain would i hear but may not but i pray for him day and night next after thee dearest friend more stanch and loving had not david in jonathan than i in him be good to him for poor gerards sake at these words which came quite unexpectedly to him denys leaned his head on margarets high chair and groaned aloud she turned quickly as she sat and found his hand and pressed it and so the sweetheart and the friend held hands while the sweetheart read i went forward all dizzied like one in an ill dream and presently a gentleman came up with his servants all on horseback and had liked to have rid oer me and he drew rein at the brow of the hill and sent his armed men back to rob me they robbed me civilly enough and took my purse and the last copper and rid gaily away i wandered stupid on a friendless pauper there was a general sigh followed by an oath from denys presently a strange dimness came oer me i lay down to sleep on the snow twas ill done and with store of wolves hard by had i loved thee as thou dost deserve i had shown more manhood but oh sweet love the drowsiness that did crawl oer me desolate and benumb me was more than nature and so i slept and but that god was better to us than i to thee or to myself from that sleep i neer had waked so all do say i had slept an hour or two as i suppose but no more when a hand did shake me rudely i awoke to my troubles and there stood a servant girl in her holiday suit are ye mad quoth she in seeming choler to sleep in snow and under wolves nosen art weary o life and not long weaned come now said she more kindly get up like a good lad so i did rise up are ye rich or are ye poor but i stared at her as one amazed why tis easy of reply quoth she are ye rich or are ye poor then i gave a great loud cry that she did start back am i rich or am i poor had ye asked me an hour agone i had said i am rich but now i am so poor as sure earth beareth on her bosom none poorer an hour agone i was rich in a friend rich in money rich in hope and spirits of youth but now the bastard of burgundy hath taken my friend and another gentleman my purse and i can neither go forward to rome nor back to her i left in holland i am poorest of the poor alack said the wench natheless an ye had been rich ye might ha lain down again in the snow for any use i had for ye and then i trow ye had soon fared out o this world as bare as ye came into it but being poor you are our man so come wi me then i went because she bade me and because i recked not now whither i went and she took me to a fine house hard by and into a noble dininghall hung with black and there was set a table with many dishes and but one plate and one chair fall to said she in a whisper what alone said i alone and which of us think ye would eat out of the same dish with ye are we robbers o the dead then she speered where i was born at tergou said i says she and when a gentleman dies in that country serve they not the dead mans dinner up as usual till he be in the ground and set some poor man to it i told her nay she blushed for us then here they were better christians so i behoved to sit down but small was my heart for meat then this kind lass sat by me and poured me out wine and tasting it it cut me to the heart denys was not there to drink with me he doth so love good wine and women good bad or indifferent the rich strong wine curled round my sick heart and that day first i did seem to glimpse why folk in trouble run to drink so she made me eat of every dish twas unlucky to pass one nought was here but her masters daily dinner he had a good stomach then said i ay lad and a good heart leastways so we all say now he is dead but being alive no word ont eer heard i so i did eat as a bird nibbling of every dish and she hearing me sigh and seeing me like to choke at the food took pity and bade me be of good cheer i should sup and lie there that night and she went to the hind and he gave me a right good bed and i told him all and asked him would the law give me back my purse law quoth he law there was none for the poor in burgundy why twas the cousin of the lady of the manor he that had robbed me he knew the wild spark the matter must be judged before the lady and she was quite young and far more like to hang me for slandering her cousin and a gentleman and a handsome man than to make him give me back my own inside the liberties of a town a poor man might now and then see the face of justice but out among the grand seigneurs and damesnever so i said ill sit down robbed rather than seek justice and find gallows they were all most kind to me next day and the girl proffered me money from her small wage to help me towards rhine oh then he is coming home he is coming home shouted denys interrupting the reader she shook her head gently at him by way of reproof i beg pardon all the company said he stiffly twas a sore temptation but being a servant my stomach rose against it nay nay said i she told me i was wrong twas pride out o place poor folk should help one another or who on earth would i said if i could do aught in return twere well but for a free gift nay i was overmuch beholden already should i write a letter for her nay he is in the house at present said she should i draw her picture and so earn my money what can ye said she i told her i could try and her habit would well become a picture so she was agog to be limned and give it her lad and i set her to stand in a good light and soon made sketches two whereof i send thee one coloured at odd hours the other i did most hastily and with little conscience daub for which may heaven forgive me but time was short they poor things knew no better and were most proud and joyous and both kissing me after their country fashion twas the hind that was her sweetheart they did bid me godspeed and i towards rhine margaret paused here and gave denys the coloured drawing to hand round it was eagerly examined by the females on account of the costume which differed in some respects from that of the dutch domestic the hair was in a tight linen bag a yellow half kerchief crossed her head from ear to ear but threw out a rectangular point that descended the centre of her forehead and it met in two more points over her bosom she wore a red kirtle with long sleeves kilted very high in front and showing a green farthingale and a great red leather purse hanging down over it red stockings yellow leathern shoes ahead of her age for they were lowquartered and squaretoed secured by a strap buckling over the instep which was not uncommon and was perhaps the rude germ of the diamond buckle to come margaret continued but oh how i missed my denys at every step often i sat down on the road and groaned and in the afternoon it chanced that i did so set me down where two roads met and with heavy head in hand and heavy heart did think of thee my poor sweetheart and of my lost friend and of the little house at tergou where they all loved me once though now it is turned to hate catherine alas that he will think so eli whisht wife and i did sigh loud and often and me sighing so one came carolling like a bird adown t other road ay chirp and chirp cried i bitterly thou has not lost sweetheart and friend thy fathers hearth thy mothers smile and every penny in the world and at last he did so carol and carol i jumped up in ire to get away from his most jarring mirth but ere i lied from it i looked down the path to see what could make a man so lighthearted in this weary world and lo the songster was a humpbacked cripple with a bloody bandage oer his eye and both legs gone at the knee he he he he he went sybrandt laughing and cackling margarets eyes flashed she began to fold the letter up nay lass said eli heed him not thou unmannerly cur offert but again and i put thee to the door why what was there to gibe at sybrandt remonstrated catherine more mildly is not our kate afflicted and is she not the most content of us all and singeth like a merle at times between her pains but i am as bad as thou prithee read on lass and stop our gabble wi somewhat worth the hearkening then said i may this thing be and i took myself to task gerard son of eli dost thou well to bemoan thy lot thou hast youth and health and here comes the wreck of nature on crutches praising gods goodness with singing like a mavis catherine there you see eli whisht dame whisht and whenever he saw me he left carolling and presently hobbled up and chanted charity for love of heaven sweet master charity with a whine as piteous as wind at keyhole alack poor soul said i charity is in my heart but not my purse i am poor as thou then he believed me none and to melt me undid his sleeve and showed a sore wound on his arm and said he poor cripple though i be i am like to lose this eye to boot look else i saw and groaned for him and to excuse myself let him wot how i had been robbed of my last copper thereat he left whining all in a moment and said in a big manly voice then ill een take a rest here youngster pull thou this strap nay fear not i pulled and down came a stout pair of legs out of his back and half his hump had melted away and the wound in his eye no deeper than the bandage oh ejaculated margarets hearers in a body whereat seeing me astounded he laughed in my face and told me i was not worth gulling and offered me his protection my face was prophetic he said of what said i marry said he that its owner will starve in this thievish land travel teaches een the young wisdom time was i had turned and fled this impostor as a pestilence but now i listened patiently to pick up crumbs of counsel and well i did for nature and his adventurous life had crammed the poor knave with shrewdness and knowledge of the homelier sorta child was i beside him when he had turned me inside out said he didst well to leave france and make for germany but think not of holland again nay on to augsburg and nurnberg the paradise of craftsmen thence to venice an thou wilt but thou wilt never bide in italy nor any other land having once tasted the great german cities why there is but one honest country in europe and that is germany and since thou art honest and since i am a vagabone germany was made for us twain i bade him make that good how might one country fit true men and knaves why thou novice said he because in an honest land are fewer knaves to bite the honest man and many honest men for the knave to bite i was in luck being honest to have fallen in with a friendly sharp be my pal said he i go to nurnberg we will reach it with full pouches ill learn ye the cul de bois and the cul de jatte and how to maund and chaunt and patter and to raise swellings and paint sores and ulcers on thy body would take in the divell i told him shivering id liever die than shame myself and my folk so eli good lad good lad why what shame was it for such as i to turn beggar beggary was an ancient and most honourable mystery what did holy monks and bishops and kings when they would win heavens smile why wash the feet of beggars those favourites of the saints the saints were no fools he told me then he did put out his foot look at that that was washed by the greatest king alive louis of france the last holy thursday that was and the next day friday clapped in the stocks by the warden of a petty hamlet so i told him my foot should walk between such high honour and such low disgrace on the same path of honesty please god well then since i had not spirit to beg he would indulge my perversity i should work under him he be the head i the fingers and with that he set himself up like a judge on a heap of dust by the roads side and questioned me strictly what i could do i began to say i was strong and willing ba said he so is an ox say what canst do that sir ox cannot i could write i had won a prize for it canst write as fast as the printers quo he jeering what else i could paint that was better i was like to tear my hair to hear him say so and me going to rome to write i could twang the psaltery a bit that was well could i tell stories ay by the score then said he i hire you from this moment what to do said i nought crooked sir candour says he i will feed thee all the way and find thee work and take half thine earnings no more agreed said i and gave my hand on it now servant said he we will dine but ye need not stand behind my chair for two reasonsfirst i ha got no chair and next good fellowship likes me better than state and out of his wallet he brought flesh fowl and pastry a good dozen of spices lapped in flax paper and wine fit for a king neer feasted i better than out of this beggars wallet now my master when we had well eaten i was for going on but said he servants should not drive their masters too hard especially after feeding for then the body is for repose and the mind turns to contemplation and he lay on his back gazing calmly at the sky and presently wondered whether there were any beggars up there i told him i knew but of one called lazarus could he do the cul de jatte better than i said he and looked quite jealous like i told him nay lazarus was honest though a beggar and fed daily of the crumbs faln from a rich mans table and the dogs licked his sores servant quo he i spy a foul fault in thee thou liest without discretion now the end of lying being to gull this is no better than fumbling with the divells tail i pray heaven thou mayest prove to paint better than thou cuttest whids or i am done out of a dinner no beggar eats crumbs but only the fat of the land and dogs lick not a beggars sores being made with spearwort or ratsbane or biting acids from all which dogs and even pigs abhor my sores are made after my proper receipt but no dog would lick een them twice i have made a scurvy bargain art a cozening knave i doubt as well as a nincompoop i deigned no reply to this bundle of lies which did accuse heavenly truth of falsehood for not being in a tale with him he rose and we took the road and presently we came to a place where were two little wayside inns scarce a furlong apart halt said my master their armories are sore fadedall the better go thou in shun the master board the wife and flatter her inn sky high all but the armories and offer to colour them dirt cheap so i went in and told the wife i was a painter and would revive her armories cheap but she sent me away with a rebuff i to my master he groaned ye are all fingers and no tongue said he i have made a scurvy bargain come and hear me patter and flatter between the two inns was a high hedge he goes behind it a minute and comes out a decent tradesman we went on to the other inn and then i heard him praise it so fulsome as the very wife did blush but says he there is one little little fault your armories are dull and faded say but the word and for a silver franc my apprentice here the cunningest eer i had shall make them bright as ever whilst she hesitated the rogue told her he had done it to a little inn hard by and now the inns face was like the starry firmament dye hear that my man cries she the three frogs have been and painted up their armories shall the four hedgehogs be outshone by them so i painted and my master stood by like a lord advising me how to do and winking to me to heed him none and i got a silver franc and he took me back to the three frogs and on the way put me on a beard and disguised me and flattered the three frogs and told them how he had adorned the four hedgehogs and into the net jumped the three poor simple frogs and i earned another silver franc then we went on and he found his crutches and sent me forward and showed his cicatrices demprunt as he called them and all his infirmities at the four hedgehogs and got both food and money come share and share quoth he so i gave him one franc i have made a good bargain said he art a master limner but takest too much time so i let him know that in matters of honest craft things could not be done quick and well then do them quick quoth he and he told me my name was bon bec and i might call him cul de jatte because that was his lay at our first meeting and at the next town my master cul de jatte bought me a psaltery and set himself up again by the roadside in state like him that erst judged marsyas and apollo piping for vain glory so i played a strain indifferent well harmonious bon bec said he haughtily now tune thy pipes so i did sing a sweet strain the good monks taught me and singing it reminded poor bon bec gerard erst of his young days and home and brought the water to my een but looking up my masters visage was as the face of a little boy whipt soundly or sipping foulest medicine zounds stop that bellyache blether quoth he that will neer wile a stiver out o peasants purses twill but sour the nurses milk and gar the kine jump into rivers to be out of earshot ont what false knave did i buy thee a fine new psaltery to be minded o my latter end withal hearken these be the songs that glad the heart and fill the minstrels purse and he sung so blasphemous a stave and eke so obscene as i drew away from him a space that the lightning might not spoil the new psaltery however none came being winter and then i said master the lord is debonair held i the thunder yon ribaldry had been thy last thou foulmouthed wretch why bon bec what is to do quoth he i have made an ill bargain oh perverse heart that turneth from doctrine so i bade him keep his breath to cool his broth neer would i shame my folk with singing ribald songs then says he sulkily the first fire we light by the wayside clap thou on the music box so twill make our pot boil for the nonce but with your good people let us peak and pine cut tristful mugs and miaul and whine thorough our nosen chaunts divine never never never ye might as well go through lorraine crying mulleygrubs mulleygrubs wholl buy my mulleygrubs so we fared on bad friends but i took a thought and prayed him hum me one of his naughty ditties again then he brightened and broke forth into ribaldry like a nightingale finger in ears stuffed i no words naught but the bare melody for oh margaret note the sly malice of the evil one still to the scurviest matter he wedded the tunablest ditties catherine that is true as holy writ sybrandt how know you that mother cornelis he he he eli whisht ye uneasy wights and let me hear the boy he is wiser than ye wiser than his years what tomfoolery is this said he yet he yielded to me and soon i garnered three of his melodies but i would not let cul de jatte wot the thing i meditated show not fools nor bairns unfinished work saith the byword and by this time twas night and a little town at hand where we went each to his inn for my master would not yield to put off his rags and other sores till morning nor i to enter an inn with a tatterdemalion so we were to meet on the road at peep of day and indeed we still lodged apart meeting at morn and parting at eve outside each town we lay at and waking at midnight and cogitating good thoughts came down to me and sudden my heart was enlightened i called to mind that my margaret had withstood the taking of the burgomasters purse tis theft said you disguise it how ye will but i must be wiser than my betters and now that which i had as good as stolen others had stolen from me as it came so it was gone then i said heaven is not cruel but just and i vowed a vow to repay our burgomaster every shilling an i could and i went forth in the morning sad but hopeful i felt lighter for the purse being gone my master was at the gate becrutched i told him id liever have seen him in another disguise beggars must not be choosers said he however soon he bade me untruss him for he felt sadly his head swam i told him forcefully to deform nature thus could scarce be wholesome he answered none but looked scared and hand on head byandby he gave a groan and rolled on the ground like a ball and writhed sore i was scared and wist not what to do but went to lift him but his trouble rose higher and higher he gnashed his teeth fearfully and the foam did fly from his lips and presently his body bended itself like a bow and jerked and bounded many times into the air i exorcised him it but made him worse there was water in a ditch hard by not very clear but the poor creature struggling between life and death i filled my hat withal and came flying to souse him then my lord laughed in my face come bon bec by thy white gills i have not forgotten my trade i stood with watery hat in hand glaring could this be feigning what else said he why a real fit is the sorriest thing but a stroke with a feather compared with mine art still betters nature but look een now blood trickleth from your nose said i ay ay pricked my nostrils with a straw but ye foamed at the lips oh a little soap makes a mickle foam and he drew out a morsel like a bean from his mouth thank thy stars bon bec says he for leading thee to a worthy master each day his lesson tomorrow we will study the cul de bois and other branches today own me prince of demoniacs and indeed of all good fellows then being puffed up he forgot yesterdays grudge and discoursed me freely of beggars and gave me who eftsoons thought a beggar was a beggar and there an end the names and qualities of full thirty sorts of masterful and crafty mendicants in france and germany and england his three provinces for so the poor proud knave yclept those kingdoms three wherein his throne it was the stocks i ween and outside the next village one had gone to dinner and left his wheelbarrow so says he ill tie myself in a knot and shalt wheel me through and what with my crippledom and thy piety awheeling of thy poor old dad well bleed the bumpkins of a dachasaltee i did refuse i would work for him but no hand would have in begging and wheeling an asker in a barrow is not that work said he then fling yon muckle stone in to boot stay ill soil it a bit and swear it is a chip of the holy sepulchre and you wheeled us both from jerusalem said i wheeling a pair o lies one stony one fleshy may be work and hard work but honest work tis not tis fumbling with his tail you wot of and said i master next time you go to tempt me to knavery speak not to me of my poor old dad said i you have minded me of my real fathers face the truest man in holland he and i are ill friends now worse luck but though i offend him shame him i never will dear margaret with this knave saying your poor old dad it had gone to my heart like a knife tis well said my master gloomily i have made a bad bargain presently he halts and eyes a tree by the wayside go spell me what is writ on yon tree so i went and there was nought but a long square drawn in outline i told him so so much for thy monkish lore quoth he a little farther and he sent me to read a wall there was nought but a circle scratched on the stone with a point of nail or knife and in the circle two dots i said so then said he bon bec that square was a warning some good truand left it that came through this village faring west that means dangerous the circle with the two dots was writ by another of our brotherhood and it signifies as how the writer soit rollin trapu soit triboulet soit catin cul de bois or what not was becked for asking here and lay two months in starabin then he broke forth talk of your little snivelling books that go in pouch three books have i france england and germany and they are writ all over in one tongue that my brethren of all countries understand and that is what i call learning so sith here they whip sores and imprison infirmities i to my tiring room and he popped behind the hedge and came back worshipful we passed through the village and i sat me down on the stocks and even the barbers apprentice whets his razor on a block so did i flesh my psaltery on this village fearing great cities i tuned it and coursed up and down the wires nimbly with my two wooden strikers and then chanted loud and clear as i had heard the minstrels of the country qui veut ouir qui veut savoir some trash i mind not what and soon the villagers male and female thronged about me thereat i left singing and recited them to the psaltery a short but right merry tale out of the lives of the saints which it is my handbook of pleasant figments and this ended instantly struck up and whistled one of cul de jattes devils ditties and played it on the psaltery to boot thou knowest heaven hath bestowed on me a rare whistle both for compass and tune and with me whistling bright and full this sprightly air and making the wires slow when the tune did gallop and tripping when the tune did amble or i did stop and shake on one note like a lark i the air they were like to eat me but looking round lo my master had given way to his itch and there was his hat on the ground and copper pouring in i deemed it cruel to whistle the bread out of povertys pouch so broke off and away yet could not get clear so swift but both men and women did slobber me sore and smelled all of garlic there master said i i call that cleaving the divell in twain and keeping his white half said he bon bec i have made a good bargain then he bade me stay where i was while he went to the holy land i stayed and he leaped the churchyard dike and the sexton was digging a grave and my master chaffered with him and came back with a knuckle bone but why he clept a churchyard holy land that i learned not then but after dinner i was colouring the armories of a little inn and he sat by me most peaceable a cutting and filing and polishing bones sedately so i speered was not honest work sweet as rain water said he mocking what was he a making a pair of bones to play on with thee and with the refuse a st anthonys thumb and a st martins little finger for the devout the vagabone and now sweet margaret thou seest our manner of life faring rhineward i with the two arts i had least prized or counted on for bread was welcome everywhere too poor now to fear robbers yet able to keep both master and man on the road for at night i often made a portraiture of the innkeeper or his dame and so went richer from an inn the which it is the lot of few but my master despised this even way of life i love ups and downs said he and certes he lacked them not one day he would gather more than i in three another to hear his tale it had rained kicks all day in lieu of saltees and that is pennies yet even then at heart he despised me for a poor mechanical soul and scorned my arts extolling his own the art of feigning natheless at odd times was he ill at his ease going through the town of aix we came upon a beggar walking fast by one hand to a carttail and the hangman a lashing his bare bloody back he stout knave so whipt did not a jot relent but i did wince at every stroke and my master hung his head soon or late bon bec quoth he soon or late i seeing his haggard face knew what he meaned and at a town whose name hath slipped me but twas on a fair river as we came to the foot of the bridge he halted and shuddered why what is the coil said i oh blind said he they are justifying there so nought would serve him but take a boat and cross the river by water but twas out of the fryingpan as the word goeth for the boatman had scarce told us the matter and that it was a man and a woman for stealing glazed windows out of housen and that the man was hanged at daybreak and the quean to be drowned when lo they did fling her off the bridge and fell in the water not far from us and oh margaret the deadly splash it ringeth in mine ears even now but worse was coming for though tied she came up and cried help help and i forgetting all and hearing a womans voice cry help was for leaping in to save her and had surely done it but the boatman and cul de jatte clung round me and in a moment the bourreaus man that waited in a boat came and entangled his hooked pole in her long hair and so thrust her down and ended her oh if the saints answered so our cries for help and poor cul de jatte groaned and i sat sobbing and beat my breast and cried of what hath god made mens hearts the reader stopped and the tears trickled down her cheeks gerard crying in lorraine made her cry at rotterdam the leagues were no more to her heart than the breadth of a room eli softened by many touches in the letter and by the readers womanly graces said kindly enough take thy time lass and methinks some of ye might find her a creepie to rest her foot and she so near her own trouble id do more for her than that an i durst said catherine here cornelis and she held out her little wooden stool and that worthy who hated margaret worse than ever had to take the creepie and put it carefully under her foot you are very kind dame she faltered i will read on tis all i can do for you in turn thus seeing my master ashy and sore shaken i deemed this horrible tragic act came timeously to warn him so i strove sore to turn him from his ill ways discoursing of sinners and their lethal end too late said he too late and gnashed his teeth then i told him too late was the divells favourite whisper in repentant ears said i the lord is debonair let sinners nought despair too late said he and gnashed his teeth and writhed his face as though vipers were biting his inward parts but dear heart his was a mind like running water ere we cleared the town he was carolling and outside the gate hung the other culprit from the bough of a little tree and scarce a yard above the ground and that stayed my vagabones music but ere we had gone another furlong he feigned to have dropped his rosary and ran back with no good intent as you shall hear i strolled on very slowly and often halting and presently he came stumping up on one leg and that bandaged i asked him how he could contrive that for twas masterly done oh that was his mystery would i know that i must join the brotherhood and presently we did pass a narrow lane and at the mouth ont espied a written stone telling beggars by a word like a wee pitchfork to go that way tis yon farmhouse said he bide thou at hand and he went to the house and came back with money food and wine this lad did the business said he slapping his one leg proudly then he undid the bandage and with prideful face showed me a hole in his calf you could have put your neef in had i been strange to his tricks here was a leg had drawn my last penny presently another farmhouse by the road he made for it i stood and asked myself should i run away and leave him not to be shamed in my own despite by him but while i doubted there was a great noise and my master well cudgelled by the farmer and his men came towards me hobbling and holloaing for the peasants had laid on heartily but more trouble was at his heels some mischievous wight loosed a dog as big as a jackass colt and came roaring after him and downed him momently i deeming the poor rogues death certain and him least fit to die drew my sword and ran shouting but ere i could come near the muckle dog had torn away his bad leg and ran growling to his lair with it and cul de jatte slipped his knot and came running like a lapwing with his hair on end and so striking with both crutches before and behind at unreal dogs as twas like a windmill crazed he fled adown the road i followed leisurely and found him at dinner curse the quiens said he and not a word all dinner time but curse the quiens i said i must know who they were before i would curse them quiens why that was dogs and i knew not even that much he had made a bad bargain well well said he tomorrow we shall be in germany there the folk are music bitten and they molest not beggars unless they fake to boot and then they drown us out of hand that moment curse em we came to strasbourg and i looked down rhine with longing heart the stream how swift it seemed running to clip sevenbergen to its soft bosom with but a piece of timber and an oar i might drift at my ease to thee sleeping yet gliding still twas a sore temptation but the fear of an ill welcome from my folk and of the neighbours sneers and the hope of coming back to thee victorious not as now i must defeated and shamed and thee with me it did withhold me and so with many sighs and often turning of the head to look on beloved rhine i turned sorrowful face and heavy heart towards augsburg alas dame alas good master eli forgive me but i neer can win over this part all at one time it taketh my breath away welladay why did he not listen to his heart had he not gone through peril enow sorrow enow welladay welladay the letter dropped from her hand and she drooped like a wounded lily then there was a clatter on the floor and it was little kate going on her crutches with flushed face and eyes full of pity to console her water mother she cried i am afeared she shall swoon nay nay fear me not said margaret feebly i will not be so troublesome thy goodwill it maketh me stouter hearted sweet mistress kate for if thou carest how i fare sure heaven is not against me catherine dye hear that my man eli ay wife i hear and mark to boot little kate went back to her place and margaret read on the germans are fonder of armorials than the french so i found work every day and whiles i wrought my master would leave me and doff his raiment and don his rags and other infirmities and cozen the world which he did clepe it plucking of the goose this done would meet me and demand half my earnings and with restless piercing eye ask me would i be so base as cheat my poor master by making three parts in lieu of two till i threatened to lend him a cuff to boot in requital of his suspicion and thenceforth took his due with feigned confidence in my good faith the which his dancing eye belied early in germany we had a quarrel i had seen him buy a skull of a jailers wife and mighty zealous a polishing it thought i how can he carry yon memento and not repent seeing where ends his way presently i did catch him selling it to a woman for the head of st barnabas with a tale had cozened an ebrew so i snatched it out of their hands and trundled it into the ditch how thou impious knave said i wouldst sell for a saint the skull of some dead thief thy brother he slunk away but shallow she did crawl after the skull and with apron reverently dust it for barnabas and it barabbas and so home with it said i non vult anser velli sed populus vult decipi catherine oh the goodly latin eli what meaneth it catherine nay i know not but tis latin is not that enow he was the flower of the flock then i to him take now thy psaltery and part we here for art a walking prison a walking hell but lo my master fell on his knees and begged me for pitys sake not turn him off what would become of him he did so love honesty thou love honesty said i ay said he not to enact it the saints forbid but to look on tis so fair a thing to look on alas good bon bec said he hadst starved peradventure but for me kick not down thy ladder call ye that just nay calm thy choler have pity on me i must have a pal and how could i bear one like myself after one so simple as thou he might cut my throat for the money that is hid in my belt tis not much tis not much with thee i walk at mine ease with a sharp i dare not go before in a narrow way alas forgive me now i know where in thy bonnet lurks the bee i will ware his sting i will but pluck the secular goose so be it said i and example was contagious he should be a true man by then we reached nurnberg twas a long way to nurnberg seeing him so humble i said well doff rags and make thyself decent twill help me forget what thou art and he did so and we sat down to our nonemete presently came by a reverend palmer with hat stuck round with cockle shells from holy land and great rosary of beads like eggs of teal and sandals for shoes and he leaned aweary on his long staff and offered us a shell apiece my master would none but i to set him a better example took one and for it gave the poor pilgrim two batzen and had his blessing and he was scarce gone when we heard savage cries and came a sorry sight one leading a wild woman in a chain all rags and howling like a wolf and when they came nigh us she fell to tearing her rags to threads the man sought an alms of us and told us his hard case twas his wife stark raving mad and he could not work in the fields and leave her in his house to fire it nor cure her could be without the saintys help and had vowed six pounds of wax to st anthony to heal her and so was fain beg of charitable folk for the money and now she espied us and flew at me with her long nails and i was cold with fear so devilish showed her face and rolling eyes and nails like birdys talons but he with the chain checked her sudden and with his whip did cruelly lash her for it that i cried forbear forbear she knoweth not what she doth and gave him a batz and being gone said i master of those twain i know not which is the more pitiable and he laughed in my face behold thy justice bon bec said he thou railest on thy poor good within an ace of honest master and bestowest alms on a vopper vopper said i what is a vopper why a trull that feigns madness that was one of us that sham maniac and wow but she did it clumsily i blushed for her and thee also gavest two batzen for a shell from holy land that came no farther than normandy i have culled them myself on that coast by scores and sold them to pilgrims true and pilgrims false to gull flats like thee withal what said i that reverend man one of us cried cul de jatte one of us in france we call them coquillarts but here calmierers railest on me for selling a false relic now and then and wastest thy earnings on such as sell nought else i tell thee bon bec said he there is not one true relic on earths face the saints died a thousand years agone and their bones mixed with the dust but the trade in relics it is of yesterday and there are forty thousand tramps in europe live by it selling relics of forty or fifty bodies oh threadbare lie and of the true cross enow to build cologne minster why then may not poor cul de jatte turn his penny with the crowd art but a scurvy tyrannical servant to let thy poor master from his share of the swag with your whoreson pilgrims palmers and friars black grey and crutched for all these are of our brotherhood and of our art only masters they and we but poor apprentices in guild for his tongue was an ell and a half a truce to thy irreverend sophistries said i and say what company is this a coming bohemians cried he ay ay this shall be the rest of the band with that came along so motley a crew as never your eyes beheld dear margaret marched at their head one with a banner on a steelpointed lance and girded with a great long sword and in velvet doublet and leathern jerkin the which stuffs neer saw i wedded afore on mortal flesh and a gay feather in his lordly cap and a couple of dead fowls at his back the which an the spark had come by honestly i am much mistook him followed wives and babes on two lean horses whose flanks still rattled like parchment drum being beaten by kettles and caldrons next an armed man ariding of a horse which drew a cart full of females and children and in it sitting backwards a lusty lazy knave lance in hand with his luxurious feet raised on a holy waterpail that lay along and therein a cat new kittened sat glowing oer her brood and sparks for eyes and the carthorse cavalier had on his shoulders a round bundle and thereon did perch a cock and crowed with zeal poor ruffler proud of his brave feathers as the rest and haply with more reason being his own and on an ass another wife and newborn child and one poor quean afoot scarce dragged herself along so near her time was she yet held two little ones by the hand and helplessly helped them on the road and the little folk were just a farce some rode sticks with horses heads between their legs which pranced and caracoled and soon wearied the riders so sore they stood stock still and wept which cavaliers were presently taken into cart and cuffed and one more grave lost in a mans hat and feather walked in egyptian darkness handed by a girl another had the great saucepan on his back and a tremendous threefooted claypot sat on his head and shoulders swallowing him so as he too went darkling led by his sweetheart three foot high when they were gone by and we had both laughed lustily said i natheless master my bowels they yearn for one of that tawdry band even for the poor wife so near the downlying scarce able to drag herself yet still poor soul helping the weaker on the way catherine nay nay margaret why wench pluck up heart certes thou art no bohemian kate nay mother tis not that i trow but her father and dear heart why take notice to put her to the blush richart so i say and he derided me why that is a biltreger said he and you waste your bowels on a pillow or so forth i told him he lied time would show said he wait till they camp and rising after meat and meditation and travelling forward we found them camped between two great trees on a common by the wayside and they had lighted a great fire and on it was their caldron and one of the trees slanting oer the fire a kid hung down by a chain from the treefork to the fire and in the fork was wedged an urchin turning still the chain to keep the meat from burning and a gay spark with a feather in his cap cut up a sheep and another had spitted a leg of it on a wooden stake and a woman ended chanticleers pride with wringing of his neck and under the other tree four rufflers played at cards and quarrelled and no word sans oath and of these lewd gamblers one had cockles in his hat and was my reverend pilgrim and a female young and comely and dressed like a butterfly sat and mended a heap of dirty rags and cul de jatte said yon is the vopper and i looked incredulous and looked again and it was so and at her feet sat he that had so late lashed her but i ween he had wist where to strike or woe betide him and she did now oppress him sore and made him thread her very needle the which he did with all humility so was their comedy turned seamy side without and cul de jatte told me twas still so with voppers and their men in camp they would don their bravery though but for an hour and with their tinsel empire and the man durst not the least gainsay the vopper or she would turn him off at these times as i my master and take another tyrant more submissive and my master chuckled over me natheless we soon espied a wife set with her back against the tree and her hair down and her face white and by her side a wench held up to her eye a newborn babe with words of cheer and the rough fellow her husband did bring her hot wine in a cup and bade her take courage and just oer the place she sat they had pinned from bough to bough of those neighbouring trees two shawls and blankets two together to keep the drizzle off her and so had another poor little rogue come into the world and by her own particular folk tended gipsywise but of the roasters and boilers and voppers and gamblers no more noticed no not for a single moment than sheep which droppeth her lamb in a field by travellers upon the way then said i what of thy foul suspicions master overknavery blinds the eye as well as oversimplicity and he laughed and said triumph bon bec triumph the chances were nine in ten against thee then i did pity her to be in a crowd at such a time but he rebuked me i should pity rather your queens and royal duchesses which by law are condemned to groan in a crowd of nobles and courtiers and do writhe with shame as well as sorrow being come of decent mothers whereas these gipsy women have no more shame under their skins than a wolf ruth or a hare valour and bon bec quoth he i espy in thee a lamentable fault wastest thy bowels wilt have none left for thy poor good master which doeth thy will by night and day then we came forward and he talked with the men in some strange hebrew cant whereof no word knew i and the poor knaves bade us welcome and denied us nought with them and all they had twas lightly come and lightly go and when we left them my master said to me this is thy first lesson but tonight we shall lie at hansburgh come with me to the rotboss there and ill show thee all our folk and their lays and especially the lossners the dutzers the schleppers the gickisses the schwanfelders whom in england we call shivering jemmies the suntvegers the schwiegers the joners the sesseldegers the gensscherers in france marcandiers or rifodes the veranerins the stabulers with a few foreigners like ourselves such as pietres francmitoux polissons malingreux traters rufflers whipjalks dommerars glymmerars jarkmen patricos swadders autem morts walking morts enow cried i stopping him art as gleesome as the evil one a counting of his imps ill jot down in my tablet all these caitiffs and their accursed names for knowledge is knowledge but go among them alive or dead that will i not with my good will moreover said i what need since i have a companion in thee who is all the knaves on earth in one and thought to abash him but his face shone with pride and hand on breast he did bow low to me if thy wit be scant good bon bec thy manners are a charm i have made a good bargain so he to the rotboss and i to a decent inn and sketched the landlords daughter by candlelight and started at morn batzen three the richer but could not find my master so loitered slowly on and presently met him coming west for me and cursing the quiens why so because he could blind the culls but not the quiens at last i prevailed on him to leave cursing and canting and tell me his adventure said he i sat outside the gate of yon monastery full of sores which i shoed the passersby oh bon bec beautifuller sores you never saw and it rained coppers in my hat presently the monks came home from some procession and the convent dogs ran out to meet them curse the quiens what did they fall on thee and bite thee poor soul worse worse dear bon bec had they bitten me i had earned silver but the great idiots being as i think puppies or little better fell on me where i sat downed me and fell a licking my sores among them as thou false knave didst swear the whelps in heaven licked the sores of lazybones a beggar of old nay nay said i i said no such thing but tell me since they bit thee not but sportfully licked thee what harm what harm noodle why the sores came off how could that be how could aught else be and them just fresh put on did i think he was so weak as bite holes in his flesh with ratsbane nay he was an artist a painter like his servant and had put on sores made of pigs blood rye meal and glue so when the folk saw my sores go on tongues of puppies they laughed and i saw cord or sack before me so up i jumped and shouted a miracle a miracle the very dogs of this holy convent be holy and have cured me good fathers cried i whose day is this st isidores said one st isidore cried i in a sort of rapture why st isidore is my patron saint so that accounts and the simple folk swallowed my miracle as those accursed quiens my wounds but the monks took me inside and shut the gate and put their heads together but i have a quick ear and one did say caret miraculo monasterium which is greek patter leastways it is no beggars cant finally they bade the lay brethren give me a hiding and take me out a back way and put me on the road and threatened me did i come back to the town to hand me to the magistrate and have me drowned for a plain impostor profit now by the churchs grace said they and mend thy ways so forward bon bec for my life is not sure nigh hand this town as we went he worked his shoulders wow but the brethren laid on and what means yon piece of monks cant i wonder so i told him the words meant the monastery is in want of a miracle but the application thereof was dark to me dark cried he dark as noon why it means they are going to work the miracle my miracle and gather all the grain i sowed therefore these blows on their benefactors shoulders therefore is he that wrought their scurry miracle driven forth with stripes and threats oh cozening knaves said i becomes you to complain of guile alas bon bec said he i but outwit the simple but these monks would pluck lucifer of his wing feathers and went a league bemoaning himself that he was not conventbred like his servant he would put it to more profit and railing on quiens and as for those monks there was one above certes said i there is one above what then who will call those shavelings to compt one day quoth he and all deceitful men said i at one that afternoon i got armories to paint so my master took the yellow jaundice and went begging through the town and with his oily tongue and saffronwater face did fill his hat now in all the towns are certain licensed beggars and one of these was an old favourite with the townsfolk had his station at st martins porch the greatest church a blind man they called him blind hans he saw my master drawing coppers on the other side the street and knew him by his tricks for an impostor so sent and warned the constables and i met my master in the constables hands and going to his trial in the town hall i followed and many more and he was none abashed neither by the pomp of justice nor memory of his misdeeds but demanded his accuser like a trumpet and blind hanss boy came forward but was sifted narrowly by my master and stammered and faltered and owned he had seen nothing but only carried blind hanss tale to the chief constable this is but hearsay said my master lo ye now here standeth misfortune backbit by envy but stand thou forth blind envy and vent thine own lie and blind hans behoved to stand forth sore against his will him did my master so press with questions and so pinch and torture asking him again and again how being blind he could see all that befell and some that befell not across a way and why an he could not see he came there holding up his perjured hand and maligning the misfortunate that at last he groaned aloud and would utter no word more and an alderman said in sooth hans ye are to blame hast cast more dirt of suspicion on thyself than on him but the burgomaster a wondrous fat man and methinks of his fat some had gotten into his head checked him and said nay hans we know this many years and be he blind or not he hath passed for blind so long tis all one back to thy porch good hans and let the strange varlet leave the town incontinent on pain of whipping then my master winked to me but there rose a civic officer in his gown of state and golden chain a dignity with us lightly prized and even shunned of some but in germany and france much courted save by condemned malefactors to wit the hangman and says he ant please you first let us see why he weareth his hair so thick and low and his man went and lifted cul de jattes hair and lo the upper gristle of both ears was gone how is this knave quoth the burgomaster my master said carelessly he minded not precisely his had been a life of misfortunes and losses when a poor soul has lost the use of his leg noble sirs these more trivial woes rest lightly in his memory when he found this would not serve his turn he named two famous battles in each of which he had lost half an ear a fighting like a true man against traitors and rebels but the hangman showed them the two cuts were made at one time and by measurement tis no bungling soldiers work my masters said he tis ourn then the burgomaster gave judgment the present charge is not proven against thee but an thou beest not guilty now thou hast been at other times witness thine ears wherefore i send thee to prison for one month and to give a florin towards the new hall of the guilds now a building and to be whipt out of the town and pay the hangmans fee for the same and all the aldermen approved and my master was haled to prison with one look of anguish it did strike my bosom i tried to get speech of him but the jailer denied me but lingering near the jail i heard a whistle and there was cul de jatte at a narrow window twenty feet from earth i went under and he asked me what made i there i told him i was loath to go forward and not bid him farewell he seemed quite amazed but soon his suspicious soul got the better that was not all mine errand i told him not all the psaltery well what of that twas not mine but his i would pay him the price of it then throw me a rix dollar said he i counted out my coins and they came to a rix dollar and two batzen i threw him up his money in three throws and when he had got it all he said softly bon bec master said i then the poor rogue was greatly moved i thought ye had been mocking me said he oh bon bec bon bec if i had found the world like thee at starting i had put my wit to better use and i had not lain here then he whimpered out i gave not quite a rix dollar for the jingler and threw me back that he had gone to cheat me of honest for once and over late and so with many sighs bade me godspeed thus did my master after often baffling mens justice fall by their injustice for his lost ears proved not his guilt only but of that guilt the bitter punishment so the account was even yet they for his chastisement did chastise him natheless he was a parlous rogue yet he holp to make a man of me thanks to his good wit i went forward richer far with my psaltery and brush than with yon as good as stolen purse for that must have run dry in time like a big trough but these a little fountain richart how pregnant his reflections be and but a curly pated lad when last i saw him asking your pardon mistress prithee read on one day i walked alone and sooth to say lighthearted for mine honest denys sweetened the air on the way but poor cul de jatte poisoned it the next day passing a grand house out came on prancing steeds a gentleman in brave attire and two servants they overtook me the gentleman bade me halt i laughed in my sleeve for a few batzen were all my store he bade me doff my doublet and jerkin then i chuckled no more bethink you my lord said i tis winter how may a poor fellow go bare and live so he told me i shot mine arrow wide of his thought and off with his own gay jerkin richly furred and doublet to match and held them forth to me then a servant let me know it was a penance his lordship had had the ill luck to slay his cousin in their cups down to my shoes he changed with me and set me on his horse like a popinjay and fared by my side in my worn weeds with my psaltery on his back and said he now good youth thou art cousin detstein and i late count thy servant play the part well and help me save my bloodstained soul be haughty and choleric as any noble and i will be as humble as i may i said i would do my best to play the noble but what should i call him he bade me call him nought but servant that would mortify him most he wist we rode on a long way in silence for i was meditating this strange chance that from a beggars servant had made me master to a count and also cudgelling my brains how best i might play the master without being run through the body all at one time like his cousin for i mistrusted sore my sparks humility your german nobles being to my knowledge proud as lucifer and choleric as fire as for the servants they did slily grin to one another to see their master so humbled what is that a lump as of lead had just bounced against the door and the latch was fumbled with unsuccessfully another bounce and the door swung inwards with giles arrayed in cloth of gold sticking to it like a wasp he landed on the floor and was embraced but on learning what was going on trumpeted that he would much liever hear of gerard than gossip sybrandt pointed to a diminutive chair giles showed his sense of this civility by tearing the said sybrandt out of a very big one and there ensconced himself gorgeous and glowing sybrandt had to wedge himself into the one which was too small for the magnificent dwarfs soul and margaret resumed but as this part of the letter was occupied with notices of places all which my reader probably knows and if not can find handled at large in a dozen wellknown books from munster to murray i skip the topography and hasten to that part where it occurred to him to throw his letter into a journal the personal narrative that intervened may be thus condensed he spoke but little at first to his new companions but listened to pick up their characters neither his noble servant nor his servants could read or write and as he often made entries in his tablets he impressed them with some awe one of his entries was le peu que sont les hommes for he found the surly innkeepers licked the very ground before him now nor did a soul suspect the hosiers son in the counts feathers nor the count in the minstrels weeds this seems to have surprised him for he enlarged on it with the naivete and pomposity of youth at one place being humbly requested to present the inn with his armorial bearings he consented loftily but painted them himself to mine hosts wonder who thought he lowered himself by handling brush the true count stood grinning by and held the paintpot while the sham count painted the shield with three red herrings rampant under a sort of maltese cross made with two ellmeasures at first his plebeian servants were insolent but this coming to the notice of his noble one he forgot what he was doing penance for and drew his sword to cut off their ears heads included but gerard interposed and saved them and rebuked the count severely and finally they all understood one another and the superior mind obtained its natural influence he played the barbarous noble of that day vilely for his heart would not let him be either tyrannical or cold here were three human beings he tried to make them all happier than he was held them ravished with stories and songs and set herr penitent and co dancing with his whistle and psaltery for his own convenience he made them ride and tie and thus pushed rapidly through the country travelling generally fifteen leagues a day diary this first day of january i observed a young man of the country to meet a strange maiden and kissed his hand and then held it out to her she took it with a smile and lo acquaintance made and babbled like old friends greeting so pretty and delicate i neer did see yet were they both of the baser sort so the next lass i saw a coming i said to my servant lord for further penance bow thy pride go meet yon baseborn girl kiss thy homicidal hand and give it her and hold her in discourse as best ye may and my noble servant said humbly i shall obey my lord and we drew rein and watched while he went forward kissed his hand and held it out to her forthwith she took it smiling and was most affable with him and he with her presently came up a band of her companions so this time i bade him doff his bonnet to them as though they were empresses and he did so and lo the lasses drew up as stiff as hedgestakes and moved not nor spake denys aie aie aie pardon the company this surprised me none for so they did discountenance poor denys and that whole day i wore in experimenting these german lasses and twas still the same an ye doff bonnet to them they stiffen into statues distance for distance but accost them with honest freedom and with that customary and though rustical most gracious proffer of the kissed hand and they withhold neither their hands in turn nor their acquaintance in an honest way seeing which i vexed myself that denys was not with us to prattle with them he is so fond of women are you fond of women denys and the reader opened two great violet eyes upon him with gentle surprise denys ahem he says so shecomrade by hannibals helmet tis their fault not mine they will have such soft voices and white skins and sunny hair and dark blue eyes and margaret reading suddenly which their affability i put to profit thus i asked them how they made shift to grow roses in yule for know dear margaret that throughout germany the baser sort of lasses wear for headdress nought but a crantz or wreath of roses encircling their bare hair as laurel caesars and though of the worshipful scorned yet is braver i wist to your eye and mine which painters be though sorry ones than the gorgeous uncouth mechanical headgear of the time and adorns not hides her hair that goodly ornament fitted to her head by craft divine so the good lasses being questioned close did let me know the rosebuds are cut in summer and laid then in great claypots thus orderedfirst bay salt then a row of buds and over that row bay salt sprinkled then another row of buds placed crosswise for they say it is death to the buds to touch one another and so on buds and salt in layers then each pot is covered and soldered tight and kept in cool cellar and on saturday night the master of the house or mistress if master be none opens a pot and doles the rosebuds out to every female in the house high or low withouten grudge then solders it up again and such as of these buds would fullblown roses make put them in warm water a little space or else in the stove and then with tiny brush and soft wetted in rhenish wine do coax them till they ope their folds and some perfume them with rosewater for alack their smell it is fled with the summer and only their fair bodyes lie withouten soul in tomb of clay awaiting resurrection and some with the roses and buds mix nutmegs gilded but not by my good will for gold brave in itself cheek by jowl with roses is but yellow earth and it does the eyes heart good to see these fair heads of hair come blooming with roses over snowy roads and by snowcapt hedges setting winters beauty by the side of summers glory for what so fair as winters lilies snow yclept and what so brave as roses and shouldst have had a picture here but for their superstition leaned a lass in sunday garb cross ankled against her cottage corner whose low roof was snowclad and with her crantz did seem a summer flower sprouting from winters bosom i drew rein and out pencil and brush to limn her for thee but the simpleton fearing the evil eye or glamour claps both hands to her face and flies panicstricken but indeed they are not more superstitious than the sevenbergen folk which take thy father for a magician yet softly sith at this moment i profit by this darkness of their minds for at first sitting down to write this diary i could frame nor thought nor word so harried and deaved was i with noise of mechanical persons and hoarse laughter at dull jests of one of these particoloured fools which are so rife in germany but oh sorry wit that is driven to the poor resource of pointed earcaps and a green and yellow body true wit methinks is of the mind we met in burgundy an honest wench though over free for my palate a chambermaid had made havoc of all these zanies droll by brute force oh digressor well then i to be rid of roaring rusticalls and mindless jests put my finger in a glass and drew on the table a great watery circle whereat the rusticalls did look askant like venison at a cat and in that circle a smaller circle the rusticalls held their peace and besides these circles cabalistical i laid down on the table solemnly yon parchment deed i had out of your house the rusticalls held their breath then did i look as glum as might be and muttered slowly thus videamusquam diu tu fictus moriovosque veri stultiaudebitisin hac aula morari strepitantes itaet olentes ut dulcissimae nequeam miser scribere they shook like aspens and stole away on tiptoe one by one at first then in a rush and jostling and left me alone and most scared of all was the fool never earned jester fairer his asss ears so rubbed i their foible who first rubbed mine for of all a travellers foes i dread those giants twain sir noise and eke sir stench the saints and martyrs forgive my peevishness thus i write to thee in balmy peace and tell thee trivial things scarce worthy ink also how i love thee which there was no need to tell for well thou knowest it and oh dear margaret looking on their roses which grew in summer but blow in winter i see the picture of our true affection born it was in smiles and bliss but soon adversity beset us sore with many a bitter blast yet our love hath lost no leaf thank god but blossoms full and fair as ever proof against frowns and jibes and prison and banishment as those sweet german flowers a blooming in winters snow january my servant the count finding me curious took me to the stables of the prince that rules this part in the first court was a horsebath adorned with twentytwo pillars graven with the princes arms and also the horseleechs shop so furnished as a rich apothecary might envy the stable is a fair quadrangle whereof three sides filled with horses of all nations before each horses nose was a glazed window with a green curtain to be drawn at pleasure and at his tail a thick wooden pillar with a brazen shield whence by turning of a pipe he is watered and serves too for a cupboard to keep his comb and rubbing clothes each rack was iron and each manger shining copper and each nag covered with a scarlet mantle and above him his bridle and saddle hung ready to gallop forth in a minute and not less than two hundred horses whereof twelve score of foreign breed and we returned to our inn full of admiration and the two varlets said sorrowfully why were we born with two legs and one of the grooms that was civil and had of me trinkgeld stood now at his cottagedoor and asked us in there we found his wife and children of all ages from five to eighteen and had but one room to bide and sleep in a thing pestiferous and most uncivil then i asked my servant knew he this prince ay did he and had often drunk with him in a marble chamber above the stable where for table was a curious and artificial rock and the drinking vessels hang on its pinnacles and at the hottest of the engagement a statue of a horseman in bronze came forth bearing a bowl of liquor and he that sat nearest behoved to drain it tis well said i now for thy penance whisper thou in yon princes ear that god hath given him his people freely and not sought a price for them as for horses and pray him look inside the huts at his horsepalace door and bethink himself is it well to house his horses and stable his folk said he twill give sore offence but said i ye must do it discreetly and choose your time so he promised and riding on we heard plaintive cries alas said i some sore mischance hath befallen some poor soul what may it be and we rode up and lo it was a wedding feast and the guests were plying the business of drinking sad and silent but ever and anon cried loud and dolefully seyte frolich be merry january yesterday between nurnberg and augsburg we parted company i gave my lord late servant back his brave clothes for mine but his horse he made me keep and five gold pieces and said he was still my debtor his penance it had been slight along of me but profitable but his best word was this i see tis more noble to be loved than feared and then he did so praise me as i blushed to put on paper yet poor fool would fain thou couldst hear his words but from some other pen than mine and the servants did heartily grasp my hand and wish me good luck and riding apace yet could i not reach augsburg till the gates were closed but it mattered little for this augsburg it is an enchanted city for a small coin one took me a long way round to a famous postern called der einlasse here stood two guardians like statues to them i gave my name and business they nodded me leave to knock i knocked and the iron gate opened with a great noise and hollow rattling of a chain but no hand seen nor chain and he who drew the hidden chain sits a butts length from the gate and i rode in and the gate closed with a clang after me i found myself in a great building with a bridge at my feet this i rode over and presently came to a porters lodge where one asked me again my name and business then rang a bell and a great portcullis that barred the way began to rise drawn by a wheel overhead and no hand seen behind the portcullis was a thick oaken door studded with steel it opened without hand and i rode into a hall as dark as pitch trembling there a while a door opened and showed me a smaller hall lighted i rode into it a tin goblet came down from the ceiling by a little chain i put two batzen into it and it went up again being gone another thick door creaked and opened and i rid through it closed on me with a tremendous clang and behold me in augsburg city i lay at an inn called the three moors over an hundred years old and this morning according to my way of viewing towns to learn their compass and shape i mounted the highest tower i could find and setting my dial at my foot surveyed the beautiful city whole streets of palaces and churches tiled with copper burnished like gold and the house fronts gaily painted and all glazed and the glass so clean and burnished as tis most resplendent and rare and i now first seeing a great city did crow with delight and like cock on his ladder and at the tower foot was taken into custody for a spy for whilst i watched the city the watchman had watched me the burgomaster received me courteously and heard my story then rebuked he the officers could ye not question him yourselves or read in his face this is to make our city stink in strangers report then he told me my curiosity was of a commendable sort and seeing i was a craftsman and inquisitive bade his clerk take me among the guilds god bless the city where the very burgomaster is cut of solomans cloth january dear margaret it is a noble city and a kind mother to arts here they cut in wood and ivory that tis like spiders work and paint on glass and sing angelical harmonies writing of books is quite gone by here be six printers yet was i offered a bountiful wage to write fairly a merchants accounts one fugger a grand and wealthy trader and hath store of ships yet his father was but a poor weaver but here in commerce her very garden men swell like mushrooms and he bought my horse of me and abated me not a jot which way of dealing is not known in holland but oh margaret the workmen of all the guilds are so kind and brotherly to one another and to me here methinks i have found the true german mind loyal frank and kindly somewhat choleric withal but nought revengeful each mechanic wears a sword the very weavers at the loom sit girded with their weapons and all germans on too slight occasion draw them and fight but no treachery challenge first then draw and with the edge only mostly the face not with sir point for if in these combats one thrust at his adversary and hurt him tis called ein schelemstucke a heinous act both men and women turn their backs on him and even the judges punish thrusts bitterly but pass over cuts hence in germany be good store of scarred faces three in five at least and in france scarce more than one in three but in arts mechanical no citizens may compare with these fountains in every street that play to heaven and in the gardens seeming trees which being approached one standing afar touches a spring and every twig shoots water and souses the guests to their hosts much delectation big culverins of war they cast with no more ado than our folk horseshoes and have done this fourscore years all stuffs they weave and linen fine as ours at home or nearly which elsewhere in europe vainly shall ye seek sir printing presssore foe to poor gerard but to other humans beneficialplieth by night and day and casteth goodly words like sower afield while i poor fool can but sow them as i saw women in france sow rye dribbling it in the furrow grain by grain and of their strange mechanical skill take two examples for ending of exemplary rogues they have a figure like a woman seven feet high and called jung frau but lo a spring is touched she seizeth the poor wretch with iron arms and opening herself hales him inside her and there pierces him through and through with two score lances secondly in all great houses the spit is turned not by a scrubby boy but by smoke ay mayst well admire and judge me a lying knave these cunning germans do set in the chimney a little windmill and the smoke struggling to wend past turns it and from the mill a wire runs through the wall and turns the spit on wheels beholding which i doffed my bonnet to the men of augsburg for who but these had ere devised to bind ye so dark and subtle a knave as sir smoke and set him to roast dame pullet this day january with three craftsmen of the town i painted a pack of cards they were for a senator in a hurry i the diamonds my queen came forth with eyes like spring violets hair a golden brown and witching smile my fellowcraftsmen saw her and put their arms round my neck and hailed me master oh noble germans no jealousy of a brotherworkman no sour looks at a stranger and would have me spend sunday with them after matins and the merchant paid me so richly as i was ashamed to take the guerdon and i to my inn and tried to paint the queen of diamonds for poor gerard but no she would not come like again luck will not be bespoke oh happy rich man that hath got her fie fie happy gerard that shall have herself one day and keep house with her at augsburg january with my fellows and one veit stoss a woodcarver and one hafnagel of the goldsmiths guild and their wives and lasses to hafnagels cousin a senator of this free city and his stupendous winevessel it is ribbed like a ship and hath been eighteen months in hand and finished but now and holds a hundred and fifty hogsheads and standeth not but lieth yet even so ye get not on his back withouten ladders two of thirty steps and we sat about the miraculous mass and drank rhenish from it drawn by a little artificial pump and the lasses pinned their crantzes to it and we danced round it and the senator danced on its back but with drinking of so many garausses lost his footing and fell off glass in hand and broke an arm and a leg in the midst of us so scurvily ended our drinking bout for this time january this day started for venice with a company of merchants and among them him who had desired me for his scrivener and so we are now agreed i to write at night the letters he shall dict and other matters he to feed and lodge me on the road we be many and armed and soldiers with us to boot so fear not the thieves which men say lie on the borders of italy but an if i find the printing press at venice i trow i shall not go unto rome for man may not vie with iron imprimit una dies quantum non scribitur anno and dearest something tells me you and i shall end our days at augsburg whence going i shall leave it all i canmy blessing january my master affecteth me much and now maketh me sit with him in his horselitter a grave good man of all respected but sad for loss of a dear daughter and loveth my psaltery not giddyfaced ditties but holy harmonies such as cul de jatte made wry mouths at so many men so many minds but cooped in horselitter and at night writing his letters my journal halteth january when not attending on my good merchant i consort with such of our company as are italians for tis to italy i wend and i am ill seen in italian tongue a courteous and a subtle people at meat delicate feeders and cleanly love not to put their left hand in the dish they say venice is the garden of lombardy lombardy the garden of italy italy of the world january strong ways and steep and the mountain girls so girded up as from their armpits to their waist is but a handful of all the garbs i yet have seen the most unlovely january in the midst of life we are in death oh dear margaret i thought i had lost thee here i lie in pain and dole and shall write thee that which read you it in a romance ye should cry most improbable and so still wondering that i am alive to write it and thanking for it god and the saints this is what befell thy gerard yestreen i wearied of being shut up in litter and of the mules slow pace and so went forward and being i know not why strangely full of spirit and hope as i have heard befall some men when on troubles brink seemed to tread on air and soon distanced them all presently i came to two roads and took the larger i should have taken the smaller after travelling a good halfhour i found my error and returned and deeming my company had long passed by pushed bravely on but i could not overtake them and small wonder as you shall hear then i was anxious and ran but bare was the road of those i sought and night came down and the wild beasts afoot and i bemoaned my folly also i was hungered the moon rose clear and bright exceedingly and presently a little way off the road i saw a tall windmill come said i mayhap the miller will take ruth on me near the mill was a haystack and scattered about were store of little barrels but lo they were not flourbarrels but tarbarrels one or two and the rest of spirits brant vein and schiedam i knew them momently having seen the like in holland i knocked at the milldoor but none answered i lifted the latch and the door opened inwards i went in and gladly for the night was fine but cold and a rime on the trees which were a kind of lofty sycamores there was a stove but black i lighted it with some of the hay and wood for there was a great pile of wood outside and i know not how i went to sleep not long had i slept i trow when hearing a noise i awoke and there were a dozen men around me with wild faces and long black hair and black sparkling eyes catherine oh my poor boy those blackhaired ones do still scare me to look on i made my excuses in such italian as i knew and eking out by signs they grinned i had lost my company they grinned i was an hungered still they grinned and spoke to one another in a tongue i knew not at last one gave me a piece of bread and a tin mug of wine as i thought but it was spirits neat i made a wry face and asked for water then these wild men laughed a horrible laugh i thought to fly but looking towards the door it was bolted with two enormous bolts of iron and now first as i ate my bread i saw it was all guarded too and ribbed with iron my blood curdled within me and yet i could not tell thee why but hadst thou seen the faces wild stupid and ruthless i mumbled my bread not to let them see i feared them but oh it cost me to swallow it and keep it in me then it whirled in my brain was there no way to escape said i they will not let me forth by the door these be smugglers or robbers so i feigned drowsiness and taking out two batzen said good men for our ladys grace let me lie on a bed and sleep for i am faint with travel they nodded and grinned their horrible grin and bade one light a lanthorn and lead me he took me up a winding staircase up up and i saw no windows but the wooden walls were pierced like a barbican tower and methinks for the same purpose and through these slits i got glimpses of the sky and thought shall i eer see thee again he took me to the very top of the mill and there was a room with a heap of straw in one corner and many empty barrels and by the wall a truckle bed he pointed to it and went downstairs heavily taking the light for in this room was a great window and the moon came in bright i looked out to see and lo it was so high that even the mill sails at their highest came not up to my window by some feet but turned very slow and stately underneath for wind there was scarce a breath and the trees seemed silver filagree made by angel craftsmen my hope of flight was gone but now those wild faces being out of sight i smiled at my fears what an if they were ill men would it profit them to hurt me natheless for caution against surprise i would put the bed against the door i went to move it but could not it was free at the head but at the foot fast clamped with iron to the floor so i flung my psaltery on the bed but for myself made a layer of straw at the door so as none could open on me unawares and i laid my sword ready to my hand and said my prayers for thee and me and turned to sleep below they drank and made merry and hearing this gave me confidence said i out of sight out of mind another hour and the good schiedam will make them forget that i am here and so i composed myself to sleep and for some time could not for the boisterous mirth below at last i dropped off how long i slept i knew not but i woke with a start the noise had ceased below and the sudden silence woke me and scarce was i awake when sudden the truckle bed was gone with a loud clang all but the feet and the floor yawned and i heard my psaltery fall and break to atoms deep deep below the very floor of the mill it had fallen into a well and so had i done lying where it lay margaret shuddered and put her face in her hands but speedily resumed i lay stupefied at first then horror fell on me and i rose but stood rooted there shaking from head to foot at last i found myself looking down into that fearsome gap and my very hair did bristle as i peered and then i remember i turned quite calm and made up my mind to die sword in hand for i saw no man must know this their bloody secret and live and i said poor margaret and i took out of my bosom where they lie ever our marriage lines and kissed them again and again and i pinned them to my shirt again that they might lie in one grave with me if die i must and i thought all our love and hopes to end thus eli whisht all their marriage lines give her time but no word i can bear no chat my poor lad during the long pause that ensued catherine leaned forward and passed something adroitly from her own lap under her daughters apron who sat next her presently thinking all in a whirl of all that ever passed between us and taking leave of all those pleasant hours i called to mind how one day at sevenbergen thou taughtest me to make a rope of straw mindest thou the moment memory brought that happy day back to me i cried out very loud margaret gives me a chance for life even here i woke from my lethargy i seized on the straw and twisted it eagerly as thou didst teach me but my fingers trembled and delayed the task whiles i wrought i heard a door open below that was a terrible moment even as i twisted my rope i got to the window and looked down at the great arms of the mill coming slowly up then passing then turning less slowly down as it seemed and i thought they go not as when there is wind yet slow or fast what man rid ever on such steed as these and lived yet said i better trust to them and god than to ill men and i prayed to him whom even the wind obeyeth dear margaret i fastened my rope and let myself gently down and fixed my eye on that huge arm of the mill which then was creeping up to me and went to spring on to it but my heart failed me at the pinch and methought it was not near enow and it passed calm and awful by i watched for another they were three and after a little while one crept up slower than the rest methought and i with my foot thrust myself in good time somewhat out from the wall and crying aloud margaret did grip with all my soul the woodwork of the sail and that moment was swimming in the air giles well done well done motion i felt little but the stars seemed to go round the sky and then the grass came up to me nearer and nearer and when the hoary grass was quite close i was sent rolling along it as if hurled from a catapult and got up breathless and every point and tie about me broken i rose but fell down again in agony i had but one leg i could stand on catherine eh dear his leg is broke my boys leg is broke and een as i lay groaning i heard a sound like thunder it was the assassins running up the stairs the crazy old mill shook under them they must have found that i had not fallen into their bloody trap and were running to despatch me margaret i felt no fear for i had now no hope i could neither run nor hide so wild the place so bright the moon i struggled up all agony and revenge more like some wounded wild beast than your gerard leaning on my sword hilt i hobbled round and swift as lighting or vengeance i heaped a great pile of their hay and wood at the mill door then drove my dagger into a barrel of their smuggled spirits and flung it on then out with my tinder and lighted the pile this will bring true men round my dead body said i aha i cried think you ill die alone cowards assassins reckless fiends and at each word on went a barrel pierced but oh margaret the fire fed by the spirits surprised me it shot up and singed my very hair it went roaring up the side of the mill swift as falls the lightning and i yelled and laughed in my torture and despair and pierced more barrels and the very tarbarrels and flung them on the fire roared like a lion for its prey and voices answered it inside from the top of the mill and the feet came thundering down and i stood as near that awful fire as i could with uplifted sword to slay and be slain the bolt was drawn a tarbarrel caught fire the door was opened what followed not the men came out but the fire rushed in at them like a living death and the first i thought to fight with was blackened and crumpled on the floor like a leaf one fearsome yell and dumb for ever the feet ran up again but fewer i heard them hack with their swords a little way up at the mills wooden sides but they had no time to hew their way out the fire and reek were at their heels and the smoke burst out at every loophole and oozed blue in the moonlight through each crevice i hobbled back racked with pain and fury there were white faces up at my window they saw me they cursed me i cursed them back and shook my naked sword come down the road i came i cried but ye must come one by one and as ye come ye die upon this steel some cursed at that but others wailed for i had them all at deadly vantage and doubtless with my smokegrimed face and fiendish rage i looked a demon and now there was a steady roar inside the mill the flame was going up it as furnace up its chimney the mill caught fire fire glimmered through it tongues of flame darted through each loophole and shot sparks and fiery flakes into the night one of the assassins leaped on to the sail as i had done in his hurry he missed his grasp and fell at my feet and bounded from the hard ground like a ball and never spoke nor moved again and the rest screamed like women and with their despair came back to me both ruth for them and hope of life for myself and the fire gnawed through the mill in placen and shot forth showers of great flat sparks like flakes of fiery snow and the sails caught fire one after another and i became a man again and staggered away terrorstricken leaning on my sword from the sight of my revenge and with great bodily pain crawled back to the road and dear margaret the rimy trees were now all like pyramids of golden filagree and lace cobweb fine in the red firelight oh most beautiful and a poor wretch got entangled in the burning sails and whirled round screaming and lost hold at the wrong time and hurled like stone from mangonel high into the air then a dull thump it was his carcass striking the earth the next moment there was a loud crash the mill fell in on its destroyer and a million great sparks flew up and the sails fell over the burning wreck and at that a million more sparks flew up and the ground was strewn with burning wood and men i prayed god forgive me and kneeling with my back to that fiery shambles i saw lights on the road a welcome sight it was a company coming towards me and scarce two furlongs off i hobbled towards them ere i had gone far i heard a swift step behind me i turned one had escaped how escaped who can divine his sword shone in the moonlight i feared him methought the ghosts of all those dead sat on that glittering glaive i put my other foot to the ground maugre the anguish and fled towards the torches moaning with pain and shouting for aid but what could i do he gained on me behooved me turn and fight denys had taught me sword play in sport i wheeled our swords clashed his clothes they smelled all singed i cut swiftly upward with supple hand and his dangled bleeding at the wrist and his sword fell it tinkled on the ground i raised my sword to hew him should he stoop fort he stood and cursed me he drew his dagger with his left i opposed my point and dared him with my eye to close a great shout arose behind me from true mens throats he started he spat at me in his rage then gnashed his teeth and fled blaspheming i turned and saw torches close at hand lo they fell to dancing up and down methought and the nextmomentallwasdark i hadah catherine here help water stand aloof you that be men margaret had fainted away chapter liv when she recovered her head was on catherines arm and the honest half of the family she had invaded like a foe stood round her uttering rough homely words of encouragement especially giles who roared at her that she was not to take on like that gerard was alive and well or he could not have writ this letter the biggest mankind had seen as yet and as he thought the beautifullest and most moving and smallest writ ay good master giles sighed margaret feebly he was alive but how know i what hath since befallen him oh why left he holland to go among strangers fierce as lions and why did i not drive him from me sooner than part him from his own flesh and blood forgive me you that are his mother and she gently removed catherines arm and made a feeble attempt to slide off the chair on to her knees which after a brief struggle with superior force ended in her finding herself on catherines bosom then margaret held out the letter to eli and said faintly but sweetly i will trust it from my hand now in sooth i am little fit to read any moreandandloth to leave my comfort and she wreathed her other arm round catherines neck read thou richart said eli thine eyes be younger than mine richart took the letter well said he such writing saw i never a writeth with a needles point and clear to boot why is he not in my countinghouse at amsterdam instead of vagabonding it out yonder when i came to myself i was seated in the litter and my good merchant holding of my hand i babbled i know not what and then shuddered awhile in silence he put a horn of wine to my lips catherine bless him bless him eli whisht and i told him what had befallen he would see my leg it was sprained sore and swelled at the ankle and all my points were broken as i could scarce keep up my hose and i said sir i shall be but a burden to you i doubt and can make you no harmony now my poor psaltery it is broken and i did grieve over my broken music companion of so many weary leagues but he patted me on the cheek and bade me not fret also he did put up my leg on a pillow and tended me like a kind father january i sit all day in the litter for we are pushing forward with haste and at night the good kind merchant sendeth me to bed and will not let me work strange wheneer i fall in with men like fiends then the next moment god still sendeth me some good man or woman lest i should turn away from human kind oh margaret how strangely mixed they be and how old i am by what i was three months agone and lo if good master fugger hath not been and bought me a psaltery catherine eli my man an yon merchant comes our way let us buy a hundred ells of cloth of him and not higgle eli that will i take your oath ont while richart prepared to read kate looked at her mother and with a faint blush drew out the piece of work from under her apron and sewed with head depressed a little more than necessary on this her mother drew a piece of work out of her pocket and sewed too while richart read both the specimens these sweet surreptitious creatures now first exposed to observation were babies caps and more than half finished which told a tale horror they were like little monks cowls in shape and delicacy january laid up in the litter and as good as blind but halting to bait lombardy plains burst on me oh margaret a land flowing with milk and honey all sloping plains goodly rivers jocund meadows delectable orchards and blooming gardens and though winter looks warmer than poor beloved holland at midsummer and makes the wanderers face to shine and his heart to leap for joy to see earth so kind and smiling here be vines cedars olives and cattle plenty but three goats to a sheep the draught oxen wear white linen on their necks and standing by dark green olivetrees each one is a picture and the folk especially women wear delicate strawen hats with flowers and leaves fairly imitated in silk with silver mixed this day we crossed a river prettily in a chained ferryboat on either bank was a windlass and a single man by turning of it drew our whole company to his shore whereat i did admire being a stranger passed over with us some country folk and an old woman looking at a young wench she did hide her face with her hand and held her crucifix out like knight his sword in tourney dreading the evil eye january safe at venice a place whose strange and passing beauty is well known to thee by report of our mariners dost mind too how peter would oft fill our ears withal we handed beneath the table and he still discoursing of this seaenthroned and peerless city in shape a bow and its great canal and palaces on piles and its watery ways plied by scores of gilded boats and that marketplace of nations orbis non urbis forum st mark his place and his statue with the peerless jewels in his eyes and the lion at his gate but i lying at my window in pain may see none of these beauties as yet but only a street fairly paved which is dull and houses with oiled paper and linen in lieu of glass which is rude and the passersby their habits and their gestures wherein they are superfluous therefore not to miss my daily comfort of whispering to thee i will een turn mine eyes inward and bind my sheaves of wisdom reaped by travel for i love thee so that no treasure pleases me not shared with thee and what treasure so good and enduring as knowledge this then have i sir footsore learned that each nation hath its proper wisdom and its proper folly and methinks could a great king or duke tramp like me and see with his own eyes he might pick the flowers and eschew the weeds of nations and go home and set his own folk on wisdoms hill the germans in the north were churlish but frank and honest in the south kindly and honest too their general blot is drunkenness the which they carry even to mislike and contempt of sober men they say commonly kanstu niecht sauffen und fressen so kanstu kienem hern wol dienen in england the vulgar sort drink as deep but the worshipful hold excess in this a reproach and drink a health or two for courtesy not gluttony and still sugar the wine in their cups the germans use little mirth or discourse but ply the business sadly crying seyte frolich the best of their drunken sport is kurlemurlehuff a way of drinking with touching deftly of the glass the beard the table in due turn intermixed with whistlings and snappings of the finger so curiously ordered as tis a labour of hercules but to the beholder right pleasant and mirthful their topers by advice of german leeches sleep with pebbles in their mouths for as of a boiling pot the lid must be set ajar so with these fleshy winepots to vent the heat of their inward parts spite of which many die suddenly from drink but tis a matter of religion to slur it and gloze it and charge some innocent disease therewith yet tis more a custom than very nature for their women come among the tipplers and do but stand a moment and as it were kiss the winecup and are indeed most temperate in eating and drinking and of all women modest and virtuous and true spouses and friends to their mates far before our holland lasses that being maids put the question to the men and being wived do lord it over them why there is a wife in tergou not far from our door one came to the house and sought her man says she youll not find him he asked my leave to go abroad this afternoon and i did give it him catherine tis sooth tis sooth twas beck hulse jonahs wife this comes of a woman wedding a boy in the south where wine is the gentry drink themselves bare but not in the north for with beer a noble shall sooner burst his body than melt his lands they are quarrelsome but tis the liquor not the mind for they are none revengeful and when they have made a bad bargain drunk they stand to it sober they keep their windows bright and judge a man by his clothes whatever fruit or grain or herb grows by the roadside gather and eat the owner seeing you shall say art welcome honest man but an ye pluck a wayside grape your very life is in jeopardy tis eating of that heaven gave to be drunken the french are much fairer spoken and not nigh so truehearted sweet words cost them nought they call it payer en blanche denys les coquins ha ha natheless courtesy is in their hearts ay in their very blood they say commonly give yourself the trouble of sitting down and such straws of speech show how blows the wind also at a public show if you would leave your seat yet not lose it tie but your napkin round the bench and no french man or woman will sit here but rather keep the place for you catherine gramercy that is manners france for me denys rose and placed his hand gracefully to his breastplate natheless they say things in sport which are not courteous but shocking le diable temporte allez au diable and so forth but i trow they mean not such dreadful wishes custom belike moderate in drinking and mix water with their wine and sing and dance over their cups and are then enchanting company they are curious not to drink in another mans cup in war the english gain the better of them in the field but the french are their masters in attack and defence of cities witness orleans where they besieged their besiegers and hashed them sore with their double and treble culverines and many other sieges in this our century more than all nations they flatter their women and despise them no she may be their sovereign ruler also they often hang their female malefactors instead of drowning them decently as other nations use the furniture in their inns is walnut in germany only deal french windows are ill the lower half is of wood and opens the upper half is of glass but fixed so that the servant cannot come at it to clean it the german windows are all glass and movable and shine far and near like diamonds in france many mean houses are not glazed at all once i saw a frenchman pass a church without unbonneting this i neer witnessed in holland germany or italy at many inns they show the traveller his sheets to give him assurance they are clean and warm them at the fire before him a laudable custom they receive him kindly and like a guest they mostly cheat him and whiles cut his throat they plead in excuse hard and tyrannous laws and true it is their law thrusteth its nose into every platter and its finger into every pie in france worshipful men wear their hats and their furs indoors and go abroad lighter clad in germany they don hat and furred cloak to go abroad but sit bareheaded and light clad round the stove the french intermix not the men and women folk in assemblies as we hollanders use round their preachers the women sit on their heels in rows and the men stand behind them their harvests are rye and flax and wine three mules shall you see to one horse and whole flocks of sheep as black as coal in germany the snails be red i lie not the french buy minstrelsy but breed jests and make their own mirth the germans foster their set fools with earcaps which move them to laughter by simulating madness a calamity that asks pity not laughter in this particular i deem that lighter nation wiser than the graver german what sayest thou alas canst not answer me now in germany the petty laws are wondrous wise and just those against criminals bloody in france bloodier still and executed a trifle more cruelly there here the wheel is common and the fiery stake and under this king they drown men by the score in paris river seine yclept but the english are as peremptory in hanging and drowning for a light fault so travellers report finally a truehearted frenchman when ye chance on one is a man as near perfect as earth affords and such a man is my denys spite of his foul mouth denys my foul mouth is that so writ master richart richart ay in sooth see else denys inspecting the letter gravely i read not the letter so richart how then denys humph ahem why just the contrary he added tis kittle work perusing of these black scratches men are agreed to take for words and i trow tis still by guess you clerks do go worthy sir my foul mouth this is the first time eer i heard ont eh mesdames but the females did not seize the opportunity he gave them and burst into a loud and general disclaimer margaret blushed and said nothing the other two bent silently over their work with something very like a sly smile denys inspected their countenances long and carefully and the perusal was so satisfactory that he turned with a tone of injured but patient innocence and bade richart read on the italians are a polished and subtle people they judge a man not by his habits but his speech and gesture here sir chough may by no means pass for falcon gentle as did i in germany pranked in my noble servants feathers wisest of all nations in their singular temperance of food and drink most foolish of all to search strangers coming into their borders and stay them from bringing much money in they should rather invite it and like other nations let the traveller from taking of it out also here in venice the dames turn their black hair yellow by the sun and art to be wiser than him who made them ye enter no italian town without a bill of health though now is no plague in europe this peevishness is for extortions sake the innkeepers cringe and fawn and cheat and in country places murder you yet will they give you clean sheets by paying therefor delicate in eating and abhor from putting their hand in the plate sooner they will apply a crust or what not they do even tell of a cardinal at rome which armeth his guests left hand with a little bifurcal dagger to hold the meat while his knife cutteth it but methinks this too is to be wiser than him who made the hand so supple and prehensile eli i am of your mind my lad they are sore troubled with the itch and ointment for it unguento per la rogna is cried at every corner of venice from this my window i saw an urchin sell it to three several dames in silken trains and to two velvet knights catherine italy my lass i rede ye wash your body i the tub o sundays and then ye can put your hand i the plate o thursday withouten offence their bread is lovely white their meats they spoil with sprinkling cheese over them o perversity their salt is black without a lie in commerce these venetians are masters of the earth and sea and govern their territories wisely only one flaw i find the same i once heard a learned friar cast up against plato his republic to wit that here women are encouraged to venal frailty and do pay a tax to the state which not content with silk and spice and other rich and honest freights good store must trade in sin twenty thousand of these jezebels there be in venice and candia and about pampered and honoured for bringing strangers to the city and many live in princely palaces of their own but herein methinks the politic signors of venice forget what king david saith except the lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain also in religion they hang their cloth according to the wind siding now with the pope now with the turk but aye with the god of traders mammon hight shall flower so cankered bloom to the worlds end but since i speak of flowers this none may deny them that they are most cunning in making roses and gilliflowers to blow unseasonably in summer they nip certain of the budding roses and water them not then in winter they dig round these discouraged plants and put in cloves and so with great art rear sweetscented roses and bring them to market in january and did first learn this art of a cow buds she grazed in summer and they sprouted at yule women have sat in the doctors chairs at their colleges but she that sat in st peters was a german italy too for artful fountains and figures that move by water and enact life and next for fountains is augsburg where they harness the foul knave smoke to good sir spit and he turneth stout master roast but lest any one place should vaunt two towns there be in europe which scorning giddy fountains bring water tame in pipes to every burghers door and he filleth his vessels with but turning of a cock one is london so watered this many a year by pipes of a league from paddington a neighbouring city and the other is the fair town of lubeck also the fierce english are reported to me wise in that they will not share their land and flocks with wolves but have fairly driven those marauders into their mountains but neither in france nor germany nor italy is a wayfarers life safe from the vagabones after sundown i can hear of no glazed house in all venice but only oiled linen and paper and behind these barbarian eyelets a wooden jalosy their name for a cowardly assassin is a brave man and for an harlot a courteous person which is as much as to say that a womans worst vice and a mans worst vice are virtues but i pray god for little holland that there an assassin may be yclept an assassin and an harlot an harlot till domesday and then gloze foul faults with silken names who can eli with a sigh he should have been a priest saving your presence my poor lass january sweetheart i must be brief and tell thee but a part of that i have seen for this day my journal ends tonight it sails for thee and i unhappy not with it but tomorrow in another ship to rome dear margaret i took a hand litter and was carried to st mark his church outside it towards the marketplace is a noble gallery and above it four famous horses cut in brass by the ancient romans and seem all moving and at the very next step must needs leap down on the beholder about the church are six hundred pillars of marble porphyry and ophites inside is a treasure greater than either at st denys or loretto or toledo here a jewelled pitcher given the seigniory by a persian king also the ducal cap blazing with jewels and on its crown a diamond and a chrysolite each as big as an almond two golden crowns and twelve golden stomachers studded with jewels from constantinople item a monstrous sapphire item a great diamond given by a french king item a prodigious carbuncle item three unicorns horns but what are these compared with the sacred relics dear margaret i stood and saw the brazen chest that holds the body of st mark the evangelist i saw with these eyes and handled his ring and his gospel written with his own hand and all my travels seemed light for who am i that i should see such things dear margaret his sacred body was first brought from alexandria by merchants in and then not prized as now for between when this church was builded and the very place where it lay was forgotten then holy priests fasted and prayed many days seeking for light and lo the evangelists body brake at midnight through the marble and stood before them they fell to the earth but in the morning found the crevice the sacred body had burst through and peering through it saw him lie then they took and laid him in his chest beneath the altar and carefully put back the stone with its miraculous crevice which crevice i saw and shall gape for a monument while the world lasts after that they showed me the virgins chair it is of stone also her picture painted by st luke very dark and the features now scarce visible this picture in time of drought they carry in procession and brings the rain i wish i had not seen it item two pieces of marble spotted with john the baptists blood item a piece of the true cross and of the pillar to which christ was tied item the rock struck by moses and wet to this hour also a stone christ sat on preaching at tyre but some say it is the one the patriarch jacob laid his head on and i hold with them by reason our lord never preached at tyre going hence they showed me the state nursery for the children of those aphrodisian dames their favourites here in the outer wall was a broad niche and if they bring them so little as they can squeeze them through it alive the bairn falls into a net inside and the state takes charge of it but if too big their mothers must even take them home again with whom abiding tis like to be mali corvi mali ovum coming out of the church we met them carrying in a corpse with the feet and face bare this i then first learned is venetian custom and sure no other town will ever rob them of it nor of this that follows on a great porphyry slab in the piazza were three ghastly heads rotting and tainting the air and in their hot summers like to take vengeance with breeding of a plague these were traitors to the state and a heavy pricetwo thousand ducatsbeing put on each head their friends had slain them and brought all three to the slab and so sold blood of others and their own faith no state buys heads so many nor pays half so high a price for that sorry merchandise but what i most admired was to see over against the dukes palace a fair gallows in alabaster reared express to bring him and no other for the least treason to the state and there it stands in his eye whispering him memento mori i pondered and owned these signors my masters who will let no man not even their sovereign be above the common weal hard by on a wall the workmen were just finishing by order of the seigniory the stone effigy of a tragical and enormous act enacted last year yet on the wall looks innocent here two gentle folks whisper together and there other twain their swords by their side four brethren were they which did on either side conspire to poison the other two and so halve their land in lieu of quartering it and at a mutual banquet these twain drugged the wine and those twain envenomed a marchpane to such good purpose that the same afternoon lay four brave men around one table grovelling in mortal agony and cursing of one another and themselves and so concluded miserably and the land for which they had lost their immortal souls went into another family and why not it could not go into a worse but o sovereign wisdom of bywords how true they put the finger on each nations or particulars fault quand italie sera sans poison et france sans trahison et langleterre sans guerre lors sera le monde sans terre richart explained this to catherine then proceeded and after this they took me to the quay and presently i espied among the masts one garlanded with amaranth flowers take me thither said i and i let my guide know the custom of our dutch skippers to hoist flowers to the masthead when they are courting a maid oft had i scoffed at this saying so then his wooing is the earths concern but now so far from the rotter that bunch at a masthead made my heart leap with assurance of a countryman they carried me and oh margaret on the stern of that dutch boy was written in muckle letters richart eliassoen amsterdam put me down i said for our ladys sake put me down i sat on the bank and looked scarce believing my eyes and looked and presently fell to crying till i could see the words no more ah me how they went to my heart those bare letters in a foreign land dear richart good kind brother richart often i have sat on his knee and rid on his back kisses many he has given me unkind word from him had i never and there was his name on his own ship and his face and all his grave but good and gentle ways came back to me and i sobbed vehemently and cried aloud why why is not brother richart here and not his name only i spake in dutch for my heart was too full to hold their foreign tongues and eli well richart go on lad prithee go on is this a place to halt at richart father with my duty to you it is easy to say go on but think ye i am not flesh and blood the poor boyssimple grief and brotherly love comingso suddenon me they go through my heart andi cannot go on sink me if i can even see the words tis writ so fine denys courage good master richart take your time here are more eyne wet than yours ah little comrade would god thou wert here and i at venice for thee richart poor little curlyheaded lad what had he done that we have driven him so far that is what i would fain know said catherine drily then fell to weeping and rocking herself with her apron over her head kind dame good friends said margaret trembling let me tell you how the letter ends the skipper hearing our gerard speak his grief in dutch accosted him and spake comfortably to him and after a while our gerard found breath to say he was worthy master richarts brother thereat was the good skipper all agog to serve him richart so so skipper master richart aforesaid will be at thy wedding and brings purse to boot margaret sir he told gerard of his consort that was to sail that very night for rotterdam and dear gerard had to go home and finish his letter and bring it to the ship and the rest it is but his poor dear words of love to me the which ant please you i think shame to hear them read aloud and ends with the lines i sent to mistress kate and they would sound so harsh now and ungrateful the pleading tone as much as the words prevailed and richart said he would read no more aloud but run his eye over it for his own brotherly satisfaction she blushed and looked uneasy but made no reply eli said catherine still sobbing a little tell me for our ladys sake how our poor boy is to live at that nasty rome he is gone there to write but here he his own words to prove writing avails nought a had died o hunger by the way but for paintbrush and psaltery well aday well said eli he has got brush and music still besides so many men so many minds writing though it had no sale in other parts may be merchandise at rome father said little kate have i your good leave to put in my word twixt mother and you and welcome little heart then seems to me painting and music close at hand be stronger than writing but being distant nought to compare for see what glamour written paper hath done here but now our gerard writing at venice hath verily put his hand into this room at rotterdam and turned all our hearts ay dear dear gerard methinks thy spirit hath rid hither on these thy paper wings and oh dear father why not do as we should do were he here in the body kate said eli fear not richart and i will give him glamour for glamour we will write him a letter and send it to rome by a sure hand with money and bid him home on the instant cornelis and sybrandt exchanged a gloomy look ah good father and meantime well meantime dear father dear mother what can we do to pleasure the absent but be kind to his poor lass and her own trouble afore her tis well said eli but i am older than thou then he turned gravely to margaret wilt answer me a question my pretty mistress if i may sir faltered margaret what are these marriage lines gerard speaks of in the letter our marriage lines sir his and mine know you not that we are betrothed before witnesses ay sure my poor father and martin wittenhaagen this is the first i ever heard of it how came they in his hands they should be in yours alas sir the more is my grief but i neer doubted him and he said it was a comfort to him to have them in his bosom yare a very foolish lass indeed i was sir but trouble teaches the simple tis a good answer well foolish or no yare honest i had shown ye more respect at first but i thought yhad been his leman and that is the truth god forbid sir denys methinks tis time for us to go give me my letter sir bide ye bide ye be not so hot for a word natheless wife methinks her red cheek becomes her better than it did you to give it her my man softly wife softly i am not counted an unjust man though i be somewhat slow here richart broke in why mistress did ye shed your blood for our gerard not i sir but maybe i would nay nay but he says you did speak sooth now alas i know not what ye mean i rede ye believe not all that my poor lad says of me love makes him blind traitress cried denys let not her throw dust in thine eyes master richart old martin tells me ye need not make signals to me shecomrade i am as blind as lovemartin tells me she cut her arm and let her blood flow and smeared her heels when gerard was hunted by the bloodhounds to turn the scent from her lad well and if i did twas my own and spilled for the good of my own said margaret defiantly but catherine suddenly clasping her she began to cry at having found a bosom to cry on of one who would have also shed her blood for gerard in danger eli rose from his chair wife said he solemnly you will set another chair at our table for every meal also another plate and knife they will be for margaret and peter she will come when she likes and stay away when she pleases none may take her place at my left hand such as can welcome her are welcome to me such as cannot i force them not to abide with me the world is wide and free within my walls i am master and my sons betrothed is welcome catherine bustled out to prepare supper eli and richart sat down and concocted a letter to bring gerard home richart promised it should go by sea to rome that very week sybrandt and cornelis exchanged a gloomy wink and stole out margaret seeing giles deep in meditation for the dwarfs intelligence had taken giant strides asked him to bring her the letter you have heard but half good master giles said she shall i read you the rest i shall be much beholden to you shouted the sonorous atom she gave him her stool curiosity bowed his pride to sit on it and margaret murmured the first part of the letter into his ear very low not to disturb eli and richart and to do this she leaned forward and put her lovely face cheek by jowl with giless hideous one a strange contrast and worth a painters while to try and represent and in this attitude catherine found her and all the mother warmed towards her and she exchanged an eloquent glance with little kate the latter smiled and sewed with drooping lashes get him home on the instant roared giles ill make a man of him hear the boy said catherine half comically half proudly we hear him said richart a mostly makes himself heard when a do speak sybrandt which will get to him first cornelis gloomily who can tell chapter lv about two months before this scene in elis home the natives of a little maritime place between naples and rome might be seen flocking to the sea beach with eyes cast seaward at a ship that laboured against a stiff gale blowing dead on the shore at times she seemed likely to weather the danger and then the spectators congratulated her aloud at others the wind and sea drove her visibly nearer and the lookerson were not without a secret satisfaction they would not have owned even to themselves non quia vexari quemquam est jucunda voluptas sed quibus ipse malis careas quia cernere suave est and the poor ship though not scientifically built for sailing was admirably constructed for going ashore with her extravagant poop that caught the wind and her lines like a cocked hat reversed to those on the beach that battered labouring frame of wood seemed alive and struggling against death with a panting heart but could they have been transferred to her deck they would have seen she had not one beating heart but many and not one nature but a score were coming out clear in that fearful hour the mariners stumbled wildly about the deck handling the ropes as each thought fit and cursing and praying alternately the passengers were huddled together round the mast some sitting some kneeling some lying prostrate and grasping the bulwarks as the vessel rolled and pitched in the mighty waves one comely young man whose ashy cheek but compressed lips showed how hard terror was battling in him with selfrespect stood a little apart holding tight by a shroud and wincing at each sea it was the illfated gerard meantime prayers and vows rose from the trembling throng amidships and to hear them it seemed there were almost as many gods about as men and women the sailors indeed relied on a single goddess they varied her titles only calling on her as queen of heaven star of the sea mistress of the world haven of safety but among the landsmen polytheism raged even those who by some strange chance hit on the same divinity did not hit on the same edition of that divinity an english merchant vowed a heap of gold to our lady of walsingham but a genoese merchant vowed a silver collar of four pounds to our lady of loretto and a tuscan noble promised ten pounds of wax lights to our lady of ravenna and with a similar rage for diversity they pledged themselves not on the true cross but on the true cross in this that or the other modern city suddenly a more powerful gust than usual catching the sail at a disadvantage the rotten shrouds gave way and the sail was torn out with a loud crack and went down the wind smaller and smaller blacker and blacker and fluttered into the sea half a mile off like a sheet of paper and ere the helmsman could put the ships head before the wind a wave caught her on the quarter and drenched the poor wretches to the bone and gave them a foretaste of chill death then one vowed aloud to turn carthusian monk if st thomas would save him another would go a pilgrim to compostella bareheaded barefooted with nothing but a coat of mail on his naked skin if st james would save him others invoked thomas dominic denys and above all catherine of sienna two petty neapolitan traders stood shivering one shouted at the top of his voice i vow to st christopher at paris a waxen image of his own weight if i win safe to land on this the other nudged him and said brother brother take heed what you vow why if you sell all you have in the world by public auction twill not buy his weight in wax hold your tongue you fool said the vociferator then in a whisper think ye i am in earnest let me but win safe to land ill not give him a rush dip others lay flat and prayed to the sea oh most merciful sea oh sea most generous oh bountiful sea oh beautiful sea be gentle be kind preserve us in this hour of peril and others wailed and moaned in mere animal terror each time the illfated ship rolled or pitched more terribly than usual and she was now a mere plaything in the arms of the tremendous waves a roman woman of the humbler class sat with her child at her halfbared breast silent amid that wailing throng her cheek ashy pale her eye calm and her lips moved at times in silent prayer but she neither wept nor lamented nor bargained with the gods whenever the ship seemed really gone under their feet and bearded men squeaked she kissed her child but that was all and so she sat patient and suckled him in deaths jaws for why should he lose any joy she could give him moribundo ay there i do believe sat antiquity among those mediaevals sixteen hundred years had not tainted the old roman blood in her veins and the instinct of a race she had perhaps scarce heard of taught her to die with decent dignity a gigantic friar stood on the poop with feet apart like the colossus of rhodes not so much defying as ignoring the peril that surrounded him he recited verses from the canticles with a loud unwavering voice and invited the passengers to confess to him some did so on their knees and he heard them and laid his hands on them and absolved them as if he had been in a snug sacristy instead of a perishing ship gerard got nearer and nearer to him by the instinct that takes the wavering to the side of the impregnable and in truth the courage of heroes facing fleshly odds might have paled by the side of that gigantic friar and his still more gigantic composure thus even here two were found who maintained the dignity of our race a woman tender yet heroic and a monk steeled by religion against mortal fears and now the sail being gone the sailors cut down the useless mast a foot above the board and it fell with its remaining hamper over the ships side this seemed to relieve her a little but now the hull no longer impelled by canvas could not keep ahead of the sea it struck her again and again on the poop and the tremendous blows seemed given by a rocky mountain not by a liquid the captain left the helm and came amidships pale as death lighten her he cried fling all overboard or we shall founder ere we strike and lose the one little chance we have of life while the sailors were executing this order the captain pale himself and surrounded by pale faces that demanded to know their fate was talking as unlike an english skipper in like peril as can well be imagined friends said he last night when all was fair too fair alas there came a globe of fire close to the ship when a pair of them come it is good luck and nought can drown her that voyage we mariners call these fiery globes castor and pollux but if castor come without pollux or pollux without castor she is doomed therefore like good christians prepare to die these words were received with a loud wail to a trembling inquiry how long they had to prepare the captain replied she may or may not last half an hour over that impossible she leaks like a sieve bustle men lighten her the poor passengers seized on everything that was on deck and flung it overboard presently they laid hold of a heavy sack an old man was lying on it sea sick they lugged it from under him it rattled two of them drew it to the side up started the owner and with an unearthly shriek pounced on it holy moses what would you do tis my all tis the whole fruits of my journey silver candlesticks silver plates brooches hanaps let go thou hoary villain cried the others shall all our lives be lost for thy illgotten gear fling him in with it cried one tis this ebrew we christian men are drowned for numbers soon wrenched it from him and heaved it over the side it splashed into the waves then its owner uttered one cry of anguish and stood glaring his white hair streaming in the wind and was going to leap after it and would had it floated but it sank and was gone for ever and he staggered to and fro tearing his hair and cursed them and the ship and the sea and all the powers of heaven and hell alike and now the captain cried out see there is a church in sight steer for that church mate and you friends pray to the saint whoeer he be so they steered for the church and prayed to the unknown god it was named after a tremendous sea pooped them broke the rudder and jammed it immovable and flooded the deck then wild with superstitious terror some of them came round gerard here is the cause of all they cried he has never invoked a single saint he is a heathen here is a pagan aboard alas good friends say not so said gerard his teeth chattering with cold and fear rather call these heathens that lie a praying to the sea friends i do honour the saintsbut i dare not pray to them nowthere is no timeoh what avail me dominic and thomas and catherine nearer gods throne than these st peter sitteth and if i pray to him its odd but i shall be drowned ere he has time to plead my cause with god oh oh oh i must need go straight to him that made the sea and the saints and me our father which art in heaven save these poor souls and me that cry for the bare life oh sweet jesus pitiful jesus that didst walk genezaret when peter sank and wept for lazarus dead when the apostles eyes were dry oh save poor gerardfor dear margarets sake at this moment the sailors were seen preparing to desert the sinking ship in the little boat which even at that epoch every ship carried then there was a rush of egotists and thirty souls crowded into it remained behind three who were bewildered and two who were paralyzed with terror the paralyzed sat like heaps of wet rags the bewildered ones ran to and fro and saw the thirty egotists put off but made no attempt to join them only kept running to and fro and wringing their hands besides these there was one on his knees praying over the wooden statue of the virgin mary as large as life which the sailors had reverently detached from the mast it washed about the deck as the water came slushing in from the sea and pouring out at the scuppers and this poor soul kept following it on his knees with his hands clasped at it and the water playing with it and there was the jew palsied but not by fear he was no longer capable of so petty a passion he sat crosslegged bemoaning his bag and whenever the spray lashed him shook his fist at where it came from and cursed the nazarenes and their gods and their devils and their ships and their waters to all eternity and the gigantic dominican having shriven the whole ship stood calmly communing with his own spirit and the roman woman sat pale and patient only drawing her child closer to her bosom as death came nearer gerard saw this and it awakened his manhood see see he said they have taen the boat and left the poor woman and her child to perish his heart soon set his wit working wife ill save thee yet please god and he ran to find a cask or a plank to float her there was none then his eye fell on the wooden image of the virgin he caught it up in his arms and heedless of a wail that issued from its worshipper like a child robbed of its toy ran aft with it come wife he cried ill lash thee and the child to this tis sore worm eaten but twill serve she turned her great dark eye on him and said a single word thyself but with wonderful magnanimity and tenderness i am a man and have no child to take care of ah said she and his words seemed to animate her face with a desire to live he lashed the image to her side then with the hope of life she lost something of her heroic calm not much her body trembled a little but not her eye the ship was now so low in the water that by using an oar as a lever he could slide her into the waves come said he while yet there is time she turned her great roman eyes wet now upon him poor youthgod forgive memy child and he launched her on the surge and with his oar kept her from being battered against the ship a heavy hand fell on him a deep sonorous voice sounded in his ear tis well now come with me it was the gigantic friar gerard turned and the friar took two strides and laid hold of the broken mast gerard did the same obeying him instinctively between them after a prodigious effort they hoisted up the remainder of the mast and carried it off fling it in said the friar and follow it they flung it in but one of the bewildered passengers had run after them and jumped first and got on one end gerard seized the other the friar the middle it was a terrible situation the mast rose and plunged with each wave like a kicking horse and the spray flogged their faces mercilessly and blinded them to help knock them off presently was heard a long grating noise ahead the ship had struck and soon after she being stationary now they were hurled against her with tremendous force their companions head struck against the upper part of the broken rudder with a horrible crack and was smashed like a cocoanut by a sledgehammer he sunk directly leaving no trace but a red stain on the water and a white clot on the jagged rudder and a death cry ringing in their ears as they drifted clear under the lee of the black hull the friar uttered a short latin prayer for the safety of his soul and took his place composedly they rolled along one moment they saw nothing and seemed down in a mere basin of watery hills the next they caught glimpses of the shore speckled bright with people who kept throwing up their arms with wild italian gestures to encourage them and the black boat driving bottom upwards and between it and them the woman rising and falling like themselves she had come across a paddle and was holding her child tight with her left arm and paddling gallantly with her right when they had tumbled along thus a long time suddenly the friar said quietly i touched the ground impossible father said gerard we are more than a hundred yards from shore prithee prithee leave not our faithful mast my son said the friar you speak prudently but know that i have business of holy church on hand and may not waste time floating when i can walk in her service there i felt it with my toes again see the benefit of wearing sandals and not shoon again and sandy thy stature is less than mine keep to the mast i walk he left the mast accordingly and extending his powerful arms rushed through the water gerard soon followed him at each overpowering wave the monk stood like a tower and closing his mouth threw his head back to encounter it and was entirely lost under it awhile then emerged and ploughed lustily on at last they came close to the shore but the suction outward baffled all their attempts to land then the natives sent stout fishermen into the sea holding by long spears in a triple chain and so dragged them ashore the friar shook himself bestowed a short paternal benediction on the natives and went on to rome with eyes bent on earth according to his rule and without pausing he did not even cast a glance back upon that sea which had so nearly engulfed him but had no power to harm him without his masters leave while he stalks on alone to rome without looking back i who am not in the service of holy church stop a moment to say that the reader and i were within six inches of this giant once before but we escaped him that time now i fear we are in for him gerard grasped every hand upon the beach they brought him to an enormous fire and with a delicacy he would hardly have encountered in the north left him to dry himself alone on this he took out of his bosom a parchment and a paper and dried them carefully when this was done to his mind and not till then he consented to put on a fishermans dress and leave his own by the fire and went down to the beach what he saw may be briefly related the captain stuck by the ship not so much from gallantry as from a conviction that it was idle to resist castor or pollux whichever it was that had come for him in a ball of fire nevertheless the sea broke up the ship and swept the poop captain and all clear of the rest and took him safe ashore gerard had a principal hand in pulling him out of the water the disconsolate hebrew landed on another fragment and on touching earth offered a reward for his bag which excited little sympathy but some amusement two more were saved on pieces of the wreck the thirty egotists came ashore but one at a time and dead one breathed still him the natives with excellent intentions took to a hot fire so then he too retired from this shifting scene as gerard stood by the sea watching with horror and curiosity mixed his late companions washed ashore a hand was laid lightly on his shoulder he turned it was the roman matron burning with womanly gratitude she took his hand gently and raising it slowly to her lips kissed it but so nobly she seemed to be conferring an honour on one deserving hand then with face all beaming and moist eyes she held her child up and made him kiss his preserver gerard kissed the child more than once he was fond of children but he said nothing he was much moved for she did not speak at all except with her eyes and glowing cheeks and noble antique gesture so large and stately perhaps she was right gratitude is not a thing of words it was an ancient roman matron thanking a modern from her heart of hearts next day towards afternoon gerardtwice as old as last year thrice as learned in human ways a boy no more but a man who had shed blood in selfdefence and grazed the grave by land and seareached the eternal city post tot naufragia tutus chapter lvi gerard took a modest lodging on the west bank of the tiber and every day went forth in search of work taking a specimen round to every shop he could hear of that executed such commissions they received him coldly we make our letter somewhat thinner than this said one how dark your ink is said another but the main cry was what avails this scant is the latin writ here now can ye not write greek ay but not nigh so well as latin then you shall never make your bread at rome gerard borrowed a beautiful greek manuscript at a high price and went home with a sad hole in his purse but none in his courage in a fortnight he had made vast progress with the greek character so then to lose no time he used to work at it till noon and hunt customers the rest of the day when he carried round a better greek specimen than any they possessed the traders informed him that greek and latin were alike unsaleable the city was thronged with works from all europe he should have come last year gerard bought a psaltery his landlady pleased with his looks and manners used often to speak a kind word in passing one day she made him dine with her and somewhat to his surprise asked him what had dashed his spirits he told her she gave him her reading of the matter those sly traders she would be bound had writers in their pay for whose work they received a noble price and paid a sorry one so no wonder they blow cold on you methinks you write too well how know i that say you marrymarry because you lock not your door like the churl pietro and women will be curious ay ay you write too well for them gerard asked an explanation why said she your good work might put out the eyes of that they are selling gerard sighed alas dame you read folk on the ill side and you so kind and frank yourself my dear little heart these romans are a subtle race me i am a siennese thanks to the virgin my mistake was leaving augsburg said gerard augsburg said she haughtily is that a place to even to rome i never heard of it for my part she then assured him that he should make his fortune in spite of the booksellers seeing thee a stranger they lie to thee without sense or discretion why all the world knows that our great folk are bitten with the writing spider this many years and pour out their money like water and turn good land and houses into writ sheepskins to keep in a chest or a cupboard god help them and send them safe through this fury as he hath through a heap of others and in sooth hath been somewhat less cutting and stabbing among rival factions and vindictive eating of their opposites livers minced and fried since scribbling came in why i can tell you two there is his eminence cardinal bassarion and his holiness the pope himself there be a pair could keep a score such as thee a writing night and day but ill speak to teresa she hears the gossip of the court the next day she told him she had seen teresa and had heard of five more signors who were bitten with the writing spider gerard took down their names and bought parchment and busied himself for some days in preparing specimens he left one with his name and address at each of these signors doors and hopefully awaited the result there was none day after day passed and left him heartsick and strange to say this was just the time when margaret was fighting so hard against odds to feed her male dependents at rotterdam and arrested for curing without a licence instead of killing with one gerard saw ruin staring him in the face he spent the afternoons picking up canzonets and mastering them he laid in playing cards to colour and struck off a meal per day this last stroke of genius got him into fresh trouble in these camere locande the landlady dressed all the meals though the lodgers bought the provisions so gerards hostess speedily detected him and asked him if he was not ashamed himself by which brusque opening having made him blush and look scared she pacified herself all in a moment and appealed to his good sense whether adversity was a thing to be overcome on an empty stomach patienza my lad times will mend meantime i will feed you for the love of heaven italian for gratis nay hostess said gerard my purse is not yet quite void and it would add to my trouble an if true folk should lose their due by me why you are as mad as your neighbour pietro with his one bad picture why how know you tis a bad picture because nobody will buy it there is one that hath no gift he will have to don casque and glaive and carry his panel for a shield gerard pricked up his ears at this so she told him more pietro had come from florence with money in his purse and an unfinished picture had taken her one unfurnished room opposite gerards and furnished it neatly when his picture was finished he received visitors and had offers for it though in her opinion liberal ones he had refused so disdainfully as to make enemies of his customers since then he had often taken it out with him to try and sell but had always brought it back and the last month she had seen one movable after another go out of his room and now he wore but one suit and lay at night on a great chest she had found this out only by peeping through the keyhole for he locked the door most vigilantly whenever he went out is he afraid we shall steal his chest or his picture that no soul in all rome is weak enough to buy nay sweet hostess see you not tis his poverty he would screen from view and the more fool he are all our hearts as ill as his a might give us a trial first anyway how you speak of him why his case is mine and your countryman to boot oh we siennese love strangers his case yours nay tis just the contrary you are the comeliest youth ever lodged in this house hair like gold he is a dark sourvisaged loon besides you know how to take a woman on her better side but not he natheless i wish he would not starve to death in my house to get me a bad name anyway one starveling is enough in any house you are far from home and it is for me which am the mistress here to number your mealsfor me and the dutch wife your mother that is far away we two women shall settle that matter mind thou thine own business being a man and leave cooking and the like to us that are in the world for little else that i see but to roast fowls and suckle men at starting and sweep their grownup cobwebs dear kind dame in sooth you do often put me in mind of my mother that is far away all the better ill put you more in mind of her before i have done with you and the honest soul beamed with pleasure gerard not being an egotist nor blinded by female partialities saw his own grief in poor proud pietro and the more he thought of it the more he resolved to share his humble means with that unlucky artist pietros sympathy would repay him he tried to waylay him but without success one day he heard a groaning in the room he knocked at the door but received no answer he knocked again a surly voice bade him enter he obeyed somewhat timidly and entered a garret furnished with a chair a picture face to wall an iron basin an easel and a long chest on which was coiled a haggard young man with a wonderfully bright eye anything more like a coiled cobra ripe for striking the first comer was never seen good signor pietro said gerard forgive me that weary of my own solitude i intrude on yours but i am your nighest neighbour in this house and methinks your brother in fortune i am an artist too you are a painter welcome signer sit down on my bed and pietro jumped off and waved him into the vacant throne with a magnificent demonstration of courtesy gerard bowed and smiled but hesitated a little i may not call myself a painter i am a writer a caligraph i copy greek and latin manuscripts when i can get them to copy and you call that an artist without offence to your superior merit signor pietro no offence stranger none only meseemeth an artist is one who thinks and paints his thought now a caligraph but draws in black and white the thoughts of another tis well distinguished signor but then a writer can write the thoughts of the great ancients and matters of pure reason such as no man may paint ay and the thoughts of god which angels could not paint but let that pass i am a painter as well but a sorry one the better thy luck they will buy thy work in rome but seeking to commend myself to one of thy eminence i thought it well rather to call myself a capable writer than a scurvy painter at this moment a step was heard on the stair ah tis the good dame cried gerard what oh hostess i am here in conversation with signor pietro i dare say he will let me have my humble dinner here the italian bowed gravely the landlady brought in gerards dinner smoking and savoury she put the dish down on the bed with a face divested of all expression and went gerard fell to but ere he had eaten many mouthfuls he stopped and said i am an illmannered churl signor pietro i neer eat to my mind when i eat alone for our ladys sake put a spoon into this ragout with me tis not unsavoury i promise you pietro fixed his glittering eye on him what good youth thou a stranger and offerest me thy dinner why see there is more than one can eat well i accept said pietro and took the dish with some appearance of calmness and flung the contents out of window then he turned trembling with mortification and ire and said let that teach thee to offer alms to an artist thou knowest not master writer gerards face flushed with anger and it cost him a bitter struggle not to box this highsouled creatures ears and then to go and destroy good food his mothers milk curdled in his veins with horror at such impiety finally pity at pietros petulance and egotism and a touch of respect for povertystruck pride prevailed however he said coldly likely what thou hast done might pass in a novel of thy countryman signor boccaccio but twas not honest make that good said the painter sullenly i offered thee half my dinner no more but thou hast taen it all hadst a right to throw away thy share but not mine pride is well but justice is better pietro stared then reflected tis well i took thee for a fool so transparent was thine artifice forgive me and prithee leave me thou seest how tis with me the world hath soured me i hate mankind i was not always so once more excuse that my discourtesy and fare thee well gerard sighed and made for the door but suddenly a thought struck him signor pietro said he we dutchmen are hard bargainers we are the lads een eij scheeren that is to shave an egg therefore i for my lost dinner do claim to feast mine eyes on your picture whose face is toward the wall nay nay said the painter hastily ask me not that i have already misconducted myself enough towards thee i would not shed thy blood saints forbid my blood stranger said pietro sullenly irritated by repeated insults to my picture which is my child my heart i did in a moment of rage make a solemn vow to drive my dagger into the next one that should flout it and the labour and love that i have given to it what are all to be slain that will not praise this picture and he looked at its back with curiosity nay nay if you would but look at it and hold your parrot tongues but you will be talking so i have turned it to the wall for ever would i were dead and buried in it for my coffin gerard reflected i accept the condition show me the picture i can but hold my peace pietro went and turned its face and put it in the best light the room afforded and coiled himself again on his chest with his eye and stiletto glittering the picture represented the virgin and christ flying through the air in a sort of cloud of shadowy cherubic faces underneath was a landscape forty or fifty miles in extent and a purple sky above gerard stood and looked at it in silence then he stepped close and looked then he retired as far off as he could and looked but said not a word when he had been at this game half an hour pietro cried out querulously and somewhat inconsistently well have you not a word to say about it gerard started i cry your mercy i forgot there were three of us here ay i have much to say and he drew his sword alas alas cried pietro jumping in terror from his lair what wouldst thou marry defend myself against thy bodkin signor and at due odds being as aforesaid a dutchman therefore hold aloof while i deliver judgment or i will pin thee to the wall like a cockchafer oh is that all said pietro greatly relieved i feared you were going to stab my poor picture with your sword stabbed already by so many foul tongues gerard pursued criticism under difficulties put himself in a position of defence with his swords point covering pietro and one eye glancing aside at the picture first signor i would have you know that in the mixing of certain colours and in the preparation of your oil you italians are far behind us flemings but let that flea stick for as small as i am i can show you certain secrets of the van eycks that you will put to marvellous profit in your next picture meantime i see in this one the great qualities of your nation verily ye are solis filii if we have colour you have imagination mother of heaven an he hath not flung his immortal soul upon the panel one thing i go by is this it makes other pictures i once admired seem drossy earthborn things the drapery here is somewhat short and stiff why not let it float freely the figures being in air and motion i will i will cried pietro eagerly i will do anything for those who will but see what i have done humph this landscape it enlightens me henceforth i scorn those little huddled landscapes that did erst content me here is natures very face a spacious plain each distance marked and every tree house figure field and river smaller and less plain by exquisite gradation till vision itself melts into distance o beautiful and the cunning rogue hath hung his celestial figure in air out of the way of his little world below here floating saints beneath heavens purple canopy there far down earth and her busy hives and they let you take this painted poetry this blooming hymn through the streets of rome and bring it home unsold but i tell thee in ghent or bruges or even in rotterdam they would tear it out of thy hands but it is a common saying that a strangers eye sees clearest courage pietro vanucci i reverence thee and though myself a scurvy painter do forgive thee for being a great one forgive thee i thank god for thee and such rare men as thou art and bow the knee to thee in just homage thy picture is immortal and thou that hast but a chest to sit on art a king in thy most royal art viva il maestro viva at this unexpected burst the painter with all the abandon of his nation flung himself on gerards neck they said it was a maniacs dream he sobbed maniacs themselves no idiots shouted gerard generous stranger i will hate men no more since the world hath such as thee i was a viper to fling thy poor dinner away a wretch a monster well monster wilt be gentle now and sup with me ah that i will whither goest thou to order supper on the instant we will have the picture for third man i will invite it whiles thou art gone my poor picture child of my heart ah master twill look on many a supper after the worms have eaten you and me i hope so said pietro chapter lvii about a week after this the two friends sat working together but not in the same spirit pietro dashed fitfully at his and did wonders in a few minutes and then did nothing except abuse it then presently resumed it in a fury to lay it down with a groan through all which kept calmly working calmly smiling the canny dutchman to be plain gerard who never had a friend he did not master had put his onagra in harness the friends were painting playing cards to boil the pot when done the indignant master took up his picture to make his daily tour in search of a customer gerard begged him to take the cards as well and try and sell them he looked all the rattlesnake but eventually embraced gerard in the italian fashion and took them after first drying the lastfinished ones in the sun which was now powerful in that happy clime gerard left alone executed a greek letter or two and then mended a little rent in his hose his landlady found him thus employed and inquired ironically whether there were no women in the house when you have done that said she come and talk to teresa my friend i spoke to thee of that hath a husband not good for much which brags his acquaintance with the great gerard went down and who should teresa be but the roman matron ah madama said he is it you the good dame told me not that and the little fairhaired boy is he well is he none the worse for his voyage in that strange boat he is well said the matron why what are you two talking about said the landlady staring at them both in turn and why tremble you so teresa mia he saved my childs life said teresa making an effort to compose herself what my lodger and he never told me a word of that art not ashamed to look me in the face alas speak not harshly to him said the matron she then turned to her friend and poured out a glowing description of gerards conduct during which gerard stood blushing like a girl and scarce recognizing his own performance gratitude painted it so fair and to think thou shouldst ask me to serve thy lodger of whom i knew nought but that he had thy good word oh fiammina and that was enough for me dear youth in serving thee i serve myself then ensued an eager description by the two women of what had been done and what should be done to penetrate the thick wall of fees commissions and chicanery which stood between the patrons of art and an unknown artist in the eternal city teresa smiled sadly at gerards simplicity in leaving specimens of his skill at the doors of the great what said she without promising the servants a sharewithout even feeing them to let the signors see thy merchandise as well have flung it into tiber welladay sighed gerard then how is an artist to find a patron for artists are poor not rich by going to some city nobler and not so greedy as this said teresa la corte romana non vuol pecora senza lana she fell into thought and said she would come again tomorrow the landlady felicitated gerard teresa has got something in her head said she teresa was scarce gone when pietro returned with his picture looking black as thunder gerard exchanged a glance with the landlady and followed him upstairs to console him what have they let thee bring home thy masterpiece as heretofore more fools they then that is not the worse why what is the matter they have bought the cards yelled pietro and hammered the air furiously right and left all the better said gerard cheerfully they flew at me for them they were enraptured with them they tried to conceal their longing for them but could not i saw i feigned i pillaged curse the boobies and he flung down a dozen small silver coins on the floor and jumped on them and danced on them with basilisk eyes and then kicked them assiduously and sent them spinning and flying and running all abroad down went gerard on his knees and followed the maltreated innocents directly and transferred them tenderly to his purse shouldst rather smile at their ignorance and put it to profit said he and so i will said pietro with concentrated indignation the brutes we will paint a pack a day we will set the whole city gambling and ruining itself while we live like princes on its vices and stupidity there was one of the queens though i had fain have kept back twas you limned her brother she had lovely redbrown hair and sapphire eyes and above all soul pietro said gerard softly i painted that one from my heart the quickwitted italian nodded and his eyes twinkled you love her so well yet leave her pietro it is because i love her so dear that i have wandered all this weary road this interesting colloquy was interrupted by the landlady crying from below come down you are wanted he went down and there was teresa again come with me ser gerard chapter lviii gerard walked silently beside teresa wondering in his own mind after the manner of artists what she was going to do with him instead of asking her so at last she told him of her own accord a friend had informed her of a working goldsmiths wife who wanted a writer her shop is hard by you will not have far to go accordingly they soon arrived at the goldsmiths wife madama said teresa leonora tells me you want a writer i have brought you a beautiful one he saved my child at sea prithee look on him with favour the goldsmiths wife complied in one sense she fixed her eyes on gerards comely face and could hardly take them off again but her reply was unsatisfactory nay i have no use for a writer ah i mind now it is my gossip claelia the sausagemaker wants one she told me and i told leonora teresa made a courteous speech and withdrew claelia lived at some distance and when they reached her house she was out teresa said calmly i will await her return and sat so still and dignified and statuesque that gerard was beginning furtively to draw her when claelia returned madama i hear from the goldsmiths wife the excellent olympia that you need a writer here she took gerard by the hand and led him forward i have brought you a beautiful one he saved my child from the cruel waves for our ladys sake look with favour on him my good dame my fair ser said claelia i have no use for a writer but now you remind me it was my friend appia claudia asked me for one but the other day she is a tailor lives in the via lepida teresa retired calmly madama said gerard this is likely to be a tedious business for you teresa opened her eyes what was ever done without a little patience she added mildly we will knock at every door at rome but you shall have justice but madama i think we are dogged i noticed a man that follows us sometimes afar sometimes close i have seen it said teresa coldly but her cheek coloured faintly it is my poor lodovico she stopped and turned and beckoned with her finger a figure approached them somewhat unwillingly when he came up she gazed him full in the face and he looked sheepish lodovico mio said she know this young ser of whom i have so often spoken to thee know him and love him for he it was who saved thy wife and child at these last words lodovico who had been bowing and grinning artificially suddenly changed to an expression of heartfelt gratitude and embraced gerard warmly yet somehow there was something in the mans original manner and his having followed his wife by stealth that made gerard uncomfortable under this caress however he said we shall have your company ser lodovico no signor replied lodovico i go not on that side tiber addio then said teresa significantly when shall you return home teresa mia when i have done mine errand lodovico they pursued their way in silence teresa now wore a sad and almost gloomy air to be brief appia claudia was merciful and did not send them over tiber again but only a hundred yards down the street to lucretia who kept the glove shop she it was wanted a writer but what for appia claudia could not conceive lucretia was a merry little dame who received them heartily enough and told them she wanted no writer kept all her accounts in her head it was for my confessor father colonna he is mad after them i have heard of his excellency said teresa who has not but good dame he is a friar he has made vow of poverty i cannot let the young man write and not be paid he saved my child at sea did he now and lucretia cast an approving look on gerard well make your mind easy a colonna never wants for money the good father has only to say the word and the princes of his race will pour a thousand crowns into his lap and such a confessor dame the best in rome his head is leagues and leagues away all the while he never heeds what you are saying why i think no more of confessing my sins to him than of telling them to that wall once to try him i confessed along with the rest as how i had killed my lodgers little girl and baked her in a pie well when my voice left off confessing he started out of his dream and says he a mustering up a gloom my erring sister say three paternosters and three ave marias kneeling and eat no butter nor eggs next wednesday and pax vobiscum and off a went with his hands behind him looking as if there was no such thing as me in the world teresa waited patiently then calmly brought this discursive lady back to the point would she be so kind as go with this good youth to the friar and speak for him alack how can i leave my shop and what need his door is aye open to writers and painters and scholars and all such cattle why one day he would not receive the duke durbino because a learned greek was closeted with him and the friars head and his so close together over a dusty parchment just come in from greece as you could put one cowl over the pair his wench onesta told me she mostly looks in here for a chat when she goes an errand this is the man for thee my friend said teresa all you have to do continued lucretia is to go to his lodgings my boy shall show them you and tell onesta you come from me and you are a writer and she will take you up to him if you put a piece of silver in the wenchs hand twill do you no harm that stands to reason i have silver said teresa warmly but stay said lucretia mind one thing what the young man saith he can do that he must be able to do or let him shun the good friar like poison he is a very wild beast against all bunglers why twas but tother day one brought him an illcarved crucifix says he is this how you present salvator mundi who died for you in mortal agony and you go and grudge him careful work this slovenly gimcrack a crucifix but that it is a crucifix of some sort and i am a holy man id dust your jacket with your crucifix says he onesta heard every word through the keyhole so mind have no fears madama said teresa loftily i will answer for his ability he saved my child gerard was not subtle enough to appreciate this conclusion and was so far from sharing teresas confidence that he begged a respite he would rather not go to the friar today would not tomorrow do as well here is a coward for ye said lucretia no he is not a coward said teresa firing up he is modest i am afraid of this highborn fastidious friar said gerard consider he has seen the handiwork of all the writers in italy dear dame teresa if you would but let me prepare a better piece of work than yet i have done and then tomorrow i will face him with it i consent said teresa they walked home together not far from his own lodging was a shop that sold vellum there was a beautiful white skin in the window gerard looked at it wistfully but he knew he could not pay for it so he went on rather hastily however he soon made up his mind where to get vellum and parting with teresa at his own door ran hastily upstairs and took the bond he had brought all the way from sevenbergen and laid it with a sigh on the table he then prepared with his chemicals to erase the old writing but as this was his last chance of reading it he now overcame his deadly repugnance to bad writing and proceeded to decipher the deed in spite of its detestable contractions it appeared by this deed that ghysbrecht van swieten was to advance some money to floris brandt on a piece of land and was to repay himself out of the rent on this gerard felt it would be imprudent and improper to destroy the deed on the contrary he vowed to decipher every word at his leisure he went downstairs determined to buy a small piece of vellum with his half of the cardmoney at the bottom of the stairs he found the landlady and teresa talking at sight of him the former cried here he is you are caught donna mia see what she has bought you and whipped out from under her apron the very skin of vellum gerard had longed for why dame why donna teresa and he was speechless with pleasure and astonishment dear donna teresa there is not a skin in all rome like it however came you to hit on this one tis glamour alas dear boy did not thine eye rest on it with desire and didst thou not sigh in turning away from it and was it for teresa to let thee want the thing after that what sagacity what goodness madama oh dame i never thought i should possess this what did you pay for it i forget addio fiammina addio ser gerard be happy be prosperous as you are good and the roman matron glided away while gerard was hesitating and thinking how to offer to pay so stately a creature for her purchase the next day in the afternoon he went to lucretia and her boy took him to fra colonnas lodgings he announced his business and feed onesta and she took him up to the friar gerard entered with a beating heart the room a large one was strewed and heaped with objects of art antiquity and learning lying about in rich profusion and confusion manuscripts pictures carvings in wood and ivory musical instruments and in this glorious chaos sat the friar poring intently over an arabian manuscript he looked up a little peevishly at the interruption onesta whispered in his ear very well said he let him be seated stay young man show me how you write and he threw gerard a piece of paper and pointed to an inkhorn so please you reverend father said gerard my hand it trembleth too much at this moment but last night i wrote a vellum page of greek and the latin version by its side to show the various character show it me gerard brought the work to him in fear and trembling then stood heartsick awaiting his verdict when it came it staggered him for the verdict was a dominican falling on his neck the next day an event took place in holland the effect of which on gerards destiny no mortal at the time nor even my intelligent reader now could i think foresee marched up to elis door a pageant brave to the eye of sense and to the vulgar judgment noble but to the philosophic pitiable more or less it looked one animal a centaur but on severe analysis proved two the human half were sadly bedizened with those two metals to clothe his carcass with which and line his pouch man has now and then disposed of his soul still the horse was the vainer brute of the two he was far worse beflounced bebonneted and bemantled than any fair lady regnante crinolina for the man under the colour of a warmingpan retained natures outline but it was subaudi equum scarce a pennyweight of honest horseflesh to be seen our crinoline spares the noble parts of women and makes but the baser parts gigantic why this preference but this poor animal from stem to stern was swamped in finery his ears were hid in great sheaths of white linen tipped with silver and blue his body swaddled in stiff gorgeous cloths descending to the ground except just in front where they left him room to mince his tail though dear to memory no doubt was lost to sight being tucked in heaven knows how only his eyes shone out like goggles through two holes pierced in the wall of haberdashery and his little front hoofs peeped in and out like rats yet did this compound gorgeous and irrational represent power absolute power it came straight from a tournament at the dukes court which being on a progress lay last night at a neighbouring townto execute the behests of royalty what ho cried the upper half and on eli emerging with his wife behind him saluted them peace be with you good people rejoice i am come for your dwarf eli looked amazed and said nothing but catherine screamed over his shoulder you have mistook your road good man here abides no dwarf nay wife he means our giles who is somewhat small of stature why gainsay what gainsayed may not be ay cried the pageant that is he and discourseth like the big taber his breast is sound for that matter said catherine sharply and prompt with his fists though at long odds else how would the poor thing keep his head in such a world as this tis well said dame art as ready with thy weapon as he art his mother likely so bring him forth and that presently see they lead a stunted mule for him the duke hath need of him sore need we are clean out o dwarven and tigercats which may not be whiles earth them yieldeth our last hop o my thumb tumbled down the well tother day and think you ill let my darling go to such an illguided house as you where the reckless trollops of servants close not the well mouth but leave it open to trap innocents like wolven the representative of autocracy lost patience at this unwonted opposition and with stern look and voice bade her bethink her whether it was the better of the two to have your abortion at court fed like a bishop and put on like a prince or to have all your heads stricken off and borne on poles with the bellman crying behold the heads of hardy rebels which having by good luck a misbegotten son did traitorously grudge him to the duke who is the true father of all his folk little or mickle nay said eli sadly miscall us not we be true folk and neither rebels nor traitors but tis sudden and the poor lad is our true flesh and blood and hath of late given proof of more sense than heretofore avails not threatening our lives whimpered catherine we grudge him not to the duke but in sooth he cannot go his linen is all in holes so there is an end but the male mind resisted this crusher think you the duke will not find linen and cloth of gold to boot none so brave none so affected at court as our monsters big or wee how long the dispute might have lasted before the iron arguments of despotism achieved the inevitable victory i know not but it was cut short by a party whom neither disputant had deigned to consult the bone of contention walked out of the house and sided with monarchy if my folk are mad i am not he roared ill go with you and on the instant at this catherine set up a piteous cry she saw another of her brood escaping from under her wing into some unknown element giles was not quite insensible to her distress so simple yet so eloquent he said nay take not on mother why tis a godsend and i am sick of this ever since gerard left it ah cruel giles should ye not rather say she is bereaved of gerard the more need of you to stay aside her and comfort her oh i am not going to rome not such a fool i shall never be farther than rotterdam and ill often come and see you and if i like not the place who shall keep me there not all the dukes in christendom good sense lies in little bulk said the emissary approvingly therefore master giles buss the old folk and thank them for misbegetting of thee and ho youbring hither his mule one of his retinue brought up the dwarf mule giles refused it with scorn and on being asked the reason said it was not just what would ye throw all into one scale put muckle to muckle and little to wee besides i hate and scorn small things ill go on the highest horse here or not at all the pursuivant eyed him attentively a moment he then adopted a courteous manner i shall study your will in all things reasonable dismount eric yours is the highest horse and if you would halt in the town an hour or so while you bid them farewell say but the word and your pleasure shall be my delight giles reflected master said he if we wait a month twill be still the same my mother is a good soul but her body is bigger than her spirit we shall not part without a tear or two and the quicker tis done the fewer so bring yon horse to me catherine threw her apron over her face and sobbed the high horse was brought and giles was for swarming up his tail like a rope but one of the servants cried out hastily forbear for he kicketh ill kick him said giles bring him close beneath this window and ill learn you all how to mount a horse which kicketh and will not be clomb by the tail the staircase of a horse and he dashed into the house and almost immediately reappeared at an upper window with a rope in his hand he fastened an end somehow and holding the other descended as swift and smooth as an oiled thunderbolt in a groove and lighted astride his high horse as unperceived by that animal as a fly settling on him the official lifted his hands to heaven in mawkish admiration i have gotten a pearl thought he and wow but this will be a good days work for me come father come mother buss me and bless me and off i go eli gave him his blessing and bade him be honest and true and a credit to his folk catherine could not speak but clung to him with many sobs and embraces and even through the mist of tears her eye detected in a moment the little rent in his sleeve he had made getting out of window and she whipped out her needle and mended it then and there and her tears fell on his arm the while unheededexcept by those unfleshly eyes with which they say the very air is thronged and so the dwarf mounted the high horse and rode away complacent with the old hand laying the court butter on his back with a trowel little recked perpusillus of two poor silly females that sat by the bereaved hearth rocking themselves and weeping and discussing all his virtues and how his mind had opened lately and blind as two beetles to his faults who rode away from them jocund and bold ingentes animos angusto pectore versans arrived at court he speedily became a great favourite one strange propensity of his electrified the palace but on account of his small size and for varietys sake and as a monster he was indulged on it in a word he was let speak the truth it is an unpopular thing he made it an intolerable one bawled it chapter lix happy the man who has two chaincables merit and women oh that i like gerard had a chaine

were two writers of fictionpetrarch and boccaccio their labours were not crowned with great public and immediate success but they sowed the good seed and it never perished but quickened in the soil awaiting sunshine from their day italy was never without a native scholar or two versed in greek and each learned greek who landed there was received fraternally the fourteenth century ere its close

without controversial bile in so zealous an epoch francesco colonna a young nobleman of florence lived for the arts at twenty he turned dominican friar his object was quiet study he retired from idle

these last loosened his faith in popular histories he travelled many years in the east and returned laden with spoils master of several choice mss and versed in greek and latin hebrew and syriac he found his country had not stood still other lettered princes besides cosmo had sprung up alfonso king of naples nicolas deste lionel deste etc above all his old friend thomas of sarzana had been made

sceptism was as naif as his enthusiasm he affected to look on the religious ceremonies of his day as his models the heathen philosophers regarded the worship of gods and departed heroes mummeries good for the populace but here his mind drew unconsciously a droll distinction whatever christian ceremony his learning taught him was of purely pagan origin that he respected out of respect for antiquity though had he with his turn of mind been a pagan and its contemporary he would have scorned it from his philosophic heights fra colonna was charmed with his new artist and having the run of half the palaces in rome sounded his praises so that he was soon called upon to resign him he told gerard what great princes wanted him but i am so happy with you father objected gerard fiddlestick about being happy with me said fra colonna you must not be happy you must be a man of the world the grand lesson i impress on the young is be a man of the world now these montesini can pay you three times as much as i can and they shall tooby jupiter and the friar clapped a terrific price on gerards pen it was acceded to without a murmur much higher prices were going for copying than authorship ever obtained for centuries under the printing press gerard had three hundred crowns for aristotles treatise on rhetoric the great are mighty sweet upon all their pets while the fancy lasts and in the rage for greek mss the handsome writer soon became a pet and nobles of both sexes caressed him like a lap dog it would have turned a vain fellows head but the canny dutchman saw the steel hand beneath the velvet glove and did not presume nevertheless it was a proud day for him when he found himself seated with fra colonna at the table of his present employer cardinal bessarion they were about a mile from the top of that table but never mind there they were and gerard had the advantage of seeing roast pheasants dished up with all their feathers as if they had just flown out of a coppice instead of off the spit also chickens cooked in bottles and tender as peaches but the grand novelty was the napkins surpassingly fine and folded into cocked hats and birds wings and fans etc instead of lying flat this electrified gerard though my readers have seen the dazzling phenomenon without tumbling backwards chair and all after dinner the tables were split in pieces and carried away and lo under each was another table spread with sweetmeats the signoras and signorinas fell upon them and gormandized but the signors eyed them with reasonable suspicion but dear father objected gerard i see not the bifurcal daggers with which men say his excellency armeth the left hand of a man nay tis the cardinal orsini which hath invented yon peevish instrument for his guests to fumble their meat withal one being in haste did skewer his tongue to his palate with it i hear o tempora o mores the ancients reclining godlike at their feasts how had they spurned such pedantries as soon as the ladies had disported themselves among the sugarplums the tables were suddenly removed and the guests sat in a row against the wall then came in ducking and scraping two ecclesiastics with lutes and kneeled at the cardinals feet and there sang the service of the day then retired with a deep obeisance in answer to which the cardinal fingered his skull cap as our late iron duke his hat the company dispersed and gerard had dined with a cardinal and one that had thrice just missed being pope but greater honour was in store one day the cardinal sent for him and after praising the beauty of his work took him in his coach to the vatican and up a private stair to a luxurious little room with a great oriel window here were inkstands sloping frames for writing on and all the instruments of art the cardinal whispered a courtier and presently the popes private secretary appeared with a glorious grimy old ms of plutarchs lives and soon gerard was seated alone copying it awestruck yet half delighted at the thought that his holiness would handle his work and read it the papal inkstands were all glorious externally but within the ink was vile but gerard carried ever good ink homemade in a dirty little inkhorn he prayed on his knees for a firm and skilful hand and set to work one side of his room was nearly occupied by a massive curtain divided in the centre but its ample folds overlapped after a while gerard felt drawn to peep through that curtain he resisted the impulse it returned it overpowered him he left plutarch stole across the matted floor took the folds of the curtain and gently gathered them up with his fingers and putting his nose through the chink ran it against a cold steel halbert two soldiers armed capapie were holding their glittering weapons crossed in a triangle gerard drew swiftly back but in that instant he heard the soft murmur of voices and saw a group of persons cringing before some hidden figure he never repeated his attempt to pry through the guarded curtain but often eyed it every hour or so an ecclesiastic peeped in eyed him chilled him and exit all this was gloomy and mechanical but the next day a gentleman richly armed bounced in and glared at him what is toward here said he gerard told him he was writing out plutarch with the help of the saints the spark said he did not know the signor in question gerard explained the circumstances of time and space that had deprived the signor plutarch of the advantage of the sparks conversation oh one of those old dead greeks they keep such a coil about ay signor one of them who being dead yet live i understand you not young man said the noble with all the dignity of ignorance what did the old fellow write love stories and his eyes sparkled merry tales like boccaccio nay lives of heroes and sages soldiers and popes soldiers and princes wilt read me of them some day and willingly signor but what would they say who employ me were i to break off work oh never heed that know you not who i am i am jacques bonaventura nephew to his holiness the pope and captain of his guards and i came here to look after my fellows i trow they have turned them out of their room for you signor bonaventura then hurried away this lively companion however having acquired a habit of running into that little room and finding gerard good company often looked in on him and chattered ephemeralities while gerard wrote the immortal lives one day he came a changed and moody man and threw himself into chair crying ah traitress traitress gerard inquired what was his ill traitress traitress was the reply whereupon gerard wrote plutarch then says bonaventura i am melancholy and for our ladys sake read me a story out of ser plutarcho to soothe my bile in all that greek is there nought about lovers betrayed gerard read him the life of alexander he got excited marched about the room and embracing the reader vowed to shun soft delights that bed of nettles and follow glory who so happy now as gerard his art was honoured and fabulous prices paid for it in a year or two he should return by sea to holland with good store of money and set up with his beloved margaret in bruges or antwerp or dear augsburg and end their days in peace and love and healthy happy labour his heart never strayed an instant from her in his prosperity he did not forget poor pietro he took the fra colonna to see his picture the friar inspected it severely and closely fell on the artists neck and carried the picture to one of the colonnas who gave a noble price for it pietro descended to the first floor and lived like a gentleman but gerard remained in his garret to increase his expenses would have been to postpone his return to margaret luxury had no charms for the singlehearted one when opposed to love jacques bonaventura made him acquainted with other gay young fellows they loved him and sought to entice him into vice and other expenses but he begged humbly to be excused so he escaped that temptation but a greater was behind chapter lx fra colonna had the run of the popes library and sometimes left off work at the same hour and walked the city with gerard on which occasions the happy artist saw all things en beau and was wrapped up in the grandeur of rome and its churches palaces and ruins the friar granted the ruins but threw cold water on the rest this place rome it is but the tomb of mighty rome he showed gerard that twenty or thirty feet of the old triumphal arches were underground and that the modern streets ran over ancient palaces and over the tops of columns and coupling this with the comparatively narrow limits of the modern city and the gigantic vestiges of antiquity that peeped aboveground here and there he uttered a somewhat remarkable simile i tell thee this village they call rome is but as one of those swallows nests ye shall see built on the eaves of a decayed abbey old rome must indeed have been fair then said gerard judge for yourself my son you see the great sewer the work of the romans in their very childhood and shall outlast vesuvius you see the fragments of the temple of peace how would you look could you see also the capitol with its fiveandtwenty temples do but note this monte savello what is it an it pleases you but the ruins of the ancient theatre of marcellus and as for testacio one of the highest hills in modern rome it is but an ancient dust heap the women of old rome flung their broken pots and pans there and loa mountain ex pede herculem ex ungue leonem gerard listened respectfully but when the holy friar proceeded by analogy to imply that the moral superiority of the heathen romans was proportionally grand he resisted stoutly has then the world lost by christ his coming said he but blushed for he felt himself reproaching his benefactor saints forbid said the friar twere heresy to say so and having made this direct concession he proceeded gradually to evade it by subtle circumlocution and reached the forbidden door by the spiral back staircase in the midst of all which they came to a church with a knot of persons in the porch a demon was being exorcised within now fra colonna had a way of uttering a curious sort of little moan when things zeno or epicurus would not have swallowed were presented to him as facts this moan conveyed to such as had often heard it not only strong dissent but pity for human credulity ignorance and error especially of course when it blinded men to the merits of pagandom the friar moaned and said then come away nay father prithee prithee i neer saw a divell cast out the friar accompanied gerard into the church but had a good shrug first there they found the demoniac forced down on his knees before the altar with a scarf tied round his neck by which the officiating priest held him like a dog in a chain not many persons were present for fame had put forth that the last demon cast out in that church went no farther than into one of the company as a cony ferreted out of one burrow runs to the next when gerard and the friar came up the priest seemed to think there were now spectators enough and began he faced the demoniac breviary in hand and first set himself to learn the individuals name with whom he had to deal come out ashtaroth oho it is not you then come out belial come out tatzi come out eza no he trembles not come out azymoth come out feriander come out foletho come out astyma come out nebul aha what have i found ye tis thou thou reptile at thine old tricks let us pray oh lord we pray thee to drive the foul fiend nebul out of this thy creature out of his hair and his eyes out of his nose out of his mouth out of his ears out of his gums out of his teeth out of his shoulders out of his arms legs loins stomach bowels thighs knees calves feet ankles fingernails toenails and soul amen the priest then rose from his knees and turning to the company said with quiet geniality gentles we have here as obstinate a divell as you may see in a summer day then facing the patient he spoke to him with great rigour sometimes addressing the man and sometimes the fiend and they answered him in turn through the same mouth now saying that they hated those holy names the priest kept uttering and now complaining they did feel so bad in their inside it was the priest who first confounded the victim and the culprit in idea by pitching into the former cuffing him soundly kicking him and spitting repeatedly in his face then he took a candle and lighted it and turned it down and burned it till it burned his fingers when he dropped it double quick then took the custodial and showed the patient the corpus domini within then burned another candle as before but more cautiously then spoke civilly to the demoniac in his human character dismissed him and received the compliments of the company good father said gerard how you have their names by heart our northern priests have no such exquisite knowledge of the hellish squadrons ay young man here we know all their names and eke their ways the reptiles this nebul is a bitter hard one to hunt out he then told the company in the most affable way several of his experiences concluding with his feat of yesterday when he drove a great hulking fiend out of a woman by her mouth leaving behind him certain nails and pins and a tuft of his own hair and cried out in a voice of anguish tis not thou that conquers me see that stone on the window sill know that the angel gabriel coming down to earth once lighted on that stone tis that has done my business the friar moaned and you believed him certes who but an infidel has discredited a revelation so precise what believe the father of lies that is pushing credulity beyond the age oh a liar does not always lie ay doth he whenever he tells an improbable story to begin and shows you a holy relic arms you against the satanic host fiends if any be not so simple shouldst have answered him out of antiquity timeo danaos et dona ferentes some blackguard chopped his wifes head off on that stone young man you take my word for it and the friar hurried gerard away alack father i fear you abashed the good priest ay by pollux said the friar with a chuckle i blistered him with a single touch of socratic interrogation what modern can parry the weapons of antiquity one afternoon when gerard had finished his days work a fine lackey came and demanded his attendance at the palace cesarini he went and was ushered into a noble apartment there was a girl seated in it working on a tapestry she rose and left the room and said she would let her mistress know a good hour did gerard cool his heels in that great room and at last he began to fret these nobles think nothing of a poor fellows time however just as he was making up his mind to slip out and go about his business the door opened and a superb beauty entered the room followed by two maids it was the young princess of the house of cesarini she came in talking rather loudly and haughtily to her dependents but at sight of gerard lowered her voice to a very feminine tone and said are you the writer messer i am signora tis well she then seated herself gerard and her maids remained standing what is your name good youth gerard signora gerard body of bacchus is that the name of a human creature it is a dutch name signora i was born at tergou in holland a harsh name girls for so wellfavoured a youth what say you the maids assented warmly what did i send for him for inquired the lady with lofty languor ah i remember be seated ser gerardo and write me a letter to ercole orsini my lover at least he says so gerard seated himself took out paper and ink and looked up to the princess for instructions she seated on a much higher chair almost a throne looked down at him with eyes equally inquiring well gerardo i am ready your excellence write then i but await the words and who think you is to provide them who but your grace whose letter it is to be gramercy what you writers find you not the words what avails your art without the words i doubt you are an impostor gerardo nay signora i am none i might make shift to put your highnesss speech into grammar as well as writing but i cannot interpret your silence therefore speak what is in your heart and i will empaper it before your eyes but there is nothing in my heart and sometimes i think i have got no heart what is in your mind then but there is nothing in my mind nor my head neither then why write at all why indeed that is the first word of sense either you or i have spoken gerardo pestilence seize him why writeth he not first then i could say nay to this and ay to that withouten headache also is it a ladys part to say the first word no signora the last it is well spoken gerardo ha ha shalt have a gold piece for thy wit give me my purse and she paid him for the article on the nail a la moyen age money never yet chilled zeal gerard after getting a gold piece so cheap felt bound to pull her out of her difficulty if the wit of man might achieve it signorina said he these things are only hard because folk attempt too much are artificial and labour phrases do but figure to yourself the signor you love i love him not well then the signor you love notseated at this table and dict to me just what you would say to him well if he sat there i should say go away gerard who was flourishing his pen by way of preparation laid it down with a groan and when he was gone said floretta your highness would say come back like enough wench now silence all and let me think he pestered me to write and i promised so mine honour is engaged what lie shall i tell the gerardo to tell the fool and she turned her head away from them and fell into deep thought with her noble chin resting on her white hand half clenched she was so lovely and statuesque and looked so inspired with thoughts celestial as she sat thus impregnating herself with mendacity that gerard forgot all except art and proceeded eagerly to transfer that exquisite profile to paper he had very nearly finished when the fair statue turned brusquely round and looked at him nay signora said he a little peevishly for heavens sake change not your posturetwas perfect see you are nearly finished all eyes were instantly on the work and all tongues active how like and done in a minute nay methinks her highnesss chin is not quite so oh a touch will make that right what a pity tis not coloured im all for colours hang black and white and her highness hath such a lovely skin take away her skin and half her beauty is lost peace can you colour ser gerardo ay signorina i am a poor hand at oils there shines my friend pietro but in this small way i can tint you to the life if you have time to waste on such vanity call you this vanity and for time it hangs on me like lead send for your colours nowquick this momentfor love of all the saints nay signorina i must prepare them i could come at the same time so be it and you floretta see that he be admitted at all hours alack leave my head leave my head forgive me signora i thought to prepare it at home to receive the colours but i will leave it and now let us despatch the letter what letter to the signor orsini and shall i waste my time on such vanity as writing lettersand to that empty creature to whom i am as indifferent as the moon nay not indifferent for i have just discovered my real sentiments i hate him and despise him girls i here forbid you once for all to mention that signors name to me again else ill whip you till the blood comes you know how i can lay on when im roused we do we do then provoke me not to it and her eye flashed daggers and she turned to gerard all instantaneous honey addio il gerardo and gerard bowed himself out of this velvet tigers den he came next day and coloured her and next he was set to make a portrait of her on a large scale and then a fulllength figure and he was obliged to set apart two hours in the afternoon for drawing and painting this princess whose beauty and vanity were prodigious and candidates for a portrait of her numerous here the thriving gerard found a new and fruitful source of income margaret seemed nearer and nearer it was holy thursday no work this day fra colonna and gerard sat in a window and saw the religious processions their number and pious ardour thrilled gerard with the devotion that now seemed to animate the whole people lately bent on earthly joys presently the pope came pacing majestically at the head of his cardinals in a red hat white cloak a capuchin of red velvet and riding a lovely white neapolitan barb caparisoned with red velvet fringed and tasselled with gold a hundred horsemen armed capapie rode behind him with their lances erected the buttend resting on the mans thigh the cardinals went uncovered all but one de medicis who rode close to the pope and conversed with him as with an equal at every fifteen steps the pope stopped a single moment and gave the people his blessing then on again gerard and the friar now came down and threading some bystreets reached the portico of one of the seven churches it was hung with black and soon the pope and cardinals who had entered the church by another door issued forth and stood with torches on the steps separated by barriers from the people then a canon read a latin bull excommunicating several persons by name especially such princes as were keeping the church out of any of her temporal possessions at this awful ceremony gerard trembled and so did the people but two of the cardinals spoiled the effect by laughing unreservedly the whole time when this was ended the black cloth was removed and revealed a gay panoply and the pope blessed the people and ended by throwing his torch among them so did two cardinals instantly there was a scramble for the torches they were fought for and torn in pieces by the candidates so devoutly that small fragments were gained at the price of black eyes bloody noses and burnt fingers in which hurtling his holiness and suite withdrew in peace and now there was a cry and the crowd rushed to a square where was a large open stage several priests were upon it praying they rose and with great ceremony donned red gloves then one of their number kneeled and with signs of the lowest reverence drew forth from a shrine a square frame like that of a mirror and inside was as it were the impression of a face it was the verum icon or true impression of our saviours face taken at the very moment of his most mortal agony for us received as it was without a grain of doubt imagine how it moved every christian heart the people threw themselves on their faces when the priest raised it on high and cries of pity were in every mouth and tears in almost every eye after a while the people rose and then the priest went round the platform showing it for a single moment to the nearest and at each sight loud cries of pity and devotion burst forth soon after this the friends fell in with a procession of flagellants flogging their bare shoulders till the blood ran streaming down but without a sign of pain in their faces and many of them laughing and jesting as they lashed the bystanders out of pity offered them wine they took it but few drank it they generally used it to free the tails of the cat which were hard with clotted blood and make the next stroke more effective most of them were boys and a young woman took pity on one fair urchin alas dear child said she why wound thy white skin so basta said he laughing tis for your sins i do it not for mine hear you that said the friar show me the whip that can whip the vanity out of mans heart the young monkey how knoweth he that stranger is a sinner more than he father said gerard surely this is not to our lords mind he was so pitiful our lord said the friar crossing himself what has he to do with this this was a custom in rome six hundred years before he was born the boys used to go through the streets at the lupercalia flogging themselves and the married women used to shove in and try and get a blow from the monkeys scourges for these blows conferred fruitfulness in those days a foolish trick this flagellation but interesting to the bystander reminds him of the grand old heathen we are so prone to forget all we owe them next they got into one of the seven churches and saw the pope give the mass the ceremony was imposing but againspoiled by the inconsistent conduct of the cardinals and other prelates who sat about the altar with their hats on chattering all through the mass like a flock of geese the eucharist in both kinds was tasted by an official before the pope would venture on it and this surprised gerard beyond measure who is that base man and what doth he there oh that is the preguste and he tastes the eucharist by way of precaution this is the country for poison and none fall oftener by it than the poor popes alas so i have heard but after the miraculous change of the bread and wine to christ his body and blood poison cannot remain gone is the bread with all its properties and accidents gone is the wine so says faith but experience tells another tale scores have died in italy poisoned in the host and i tell you father that were both bread and wine charged with direst poison before his holiness had consecrated them yet after consecration i would take them both withouten fear so would i but for the fine arts what mean you marry that i would be as ready to leave the world as thou were it not for those arts which beautify existence here below and make it dear to men of sense and education no so long as the nine muses strew my path with roses of learning and art me may apollo inspire with wisdom and caution that knowing the wiles of my countrymen i may eat poison neither at gods altar nor at a friends table since wherever i eat it or drink it it will assuredly cut short my mortal thread and i am writing a bookheart and soul in itthe dream of polifilo the man of many arts so name not poison to me till that is finished and copied and now the great bells of st john laterans were rung with a clash at short intervals and the people hurried thither to see the heads of st peter and st paul gerard and the friar got a good place in the church and there was a great curtain and after long and breathless expectation of the people this curtain was drawn by jerks and at a height of about thirty feet were two human heads with bearded faces that seemed alive they were shown no longer than the time to say an ave maria and then the curtain drawn but they were shown in this fashion three times st peters complexion was pale his face oval his beard grey and forked his head crowned with a papal mitre st paul was dark skinned with a thick square beard his face also and head were more square and massive and full of resolution gerard was awestruck the friar approved after his fashion this exhibition of the imagines or waxen effigies of heroes and demigods is a venerable custom and inciteth the vulgar to virtue by great and invisible examples waxen images what are they not the apostles themselves embalmed or the like the friar moaned they did not exist in the year the great old roman families always produced at their funerals a series of these imagines thereby tying past and present history together and showing the populace the features of farfamed worthies i can conceive nothing more thrilling or instructive but then the effigies were portraits made during life or at the hour of death these of st paul and st peter are moulded out of pure fancy ah say not so father but the worst is this humour of showing them up on a shelf and half in the dark and by snatches and with the poor mountebank trick of a drawn curtain quodcunque ostendis mihi sic incredulus odi enough the men of this day are not the men of old let us have done with these newfangled mummeries and go among the popes books there we shall find the wisdom we shall vainly hunt in the streets of modern rome and this idea having once taken root the good friar plunged and tore through the crowd and looked neither to the right hand nor to the left till he had escaped the glories of the holy week which had brought fifty thousand strangers to rome and had got nice and quiet among the dead in the library of the vatican presently going into gerards room he found a hot dispute afoot between him and jacques bonaventura that spark had come in all steel from head to toe doffed helmet puffed and railed most scornfully on a ridiculous ceremony at which he and his soldiers had been compelled to attend the pope to wit the blessing of the beasts of burden gerard said it was not ridiculous nothing a pope did could be ridiculous the argument grew warm and the friar stood grimly neuter waiting like the stork that ate the frog and the mouse at the close of their combat to grind them both between the jaws of antiquity when lo the curtain was gently drawn and there stood a venerable old man in a purple skull cap with a beard like white floss silk looking at them with a kind though feeble smile happy youth said he that can heat itself over such matters they all fell on their knees it was the pope nay rise my children said he almost peevishly i came not into this corner to be in state how goes plutarch gerard brought his work and kneeling on one knee presented it to his holiness who had seated himself the others standing his holiness inspected it with interest tis excellently writ said he gerards heart beat with delight ah this plutarch he had a wondrous art francesco how each character standeth out alive on his page how full of nature each yet how unlike his fellow jacques bonaventura give me the signor boccaccio his holiness an excellent narrator capitano and writeth exquisite italian but in spirit a thought too monotonous monks and nuns were never all unchaste one or two such stories were right pleasant and diverting but five score paint his time falsely and sadden the heart of such as love mankind moreover he hath no skill at characters now this greek is supreme in that great art he carveth them with pen and turning his page see into how real and great a world we enter of war and policy and business and love in its own place for with him as in the great world men are not all running after a wench with this great open field compare me not the narrow garden of boccaccio and his little millround of dishonest pleasures your holiness they say hath not disdained to write a novel my holiness hath done more foolish things than one whereof it repents too late when i wrote novels i little thought to be head of the church i search in vain for a copy of it to add to my poor library it is well then the strict orders i gave four years ago to destroy every copy in italy have been well discharged however for your comfort on my being made pope some fool turned it into french so that you may read it at the price of exile reduced to this strait we throw ourselves on your holinesss generosity vouchsafe to give us your infallible judgment on it gently gently good francesco a popes novels are not matters of faith i can but give you my sincere impression well then the work in question had as far as i can remember all the vices of boccaccio without his choice italian fra colonna your holiness is known for slighting aeneas silvius as other men never slighted him i did him injustice to make you his judge perhaps your holiness will decide more justly between these two boysabout blessing the beasts the pope demurred in speaking of plutarch he had brightened up for a moment and his eye had even flashed but his general manner was as unlike what youthful females expect in a pope as you can conceive i can only describe it in french le gentilhomme blase a highbred and highly cultivated gentleman who had done and said and seen and known everything and whose body was nearly worn out but double languor seemed to seize him at the fathers proposal my poor francesco said he bethink thee that i have had a life of controversy and am sick ont sick as death plutarch drew me to this calm retreat not divinity nay but your holiness for moderating of strife between two hot young bloods makarioi oi eirinopioi and know you nature so ill as to think either of these highmettled youths will reck what a poor old pope saith oh your holiness broke in gerard blushing and gasping sure here is one who will treasure your words all his life as words from heaven in that case said the pope i am fairly caught as francesco here would say ouk estin ostis est anyr eleutheos i came to taste that eloquent heathen dear to me een as to thee thou paynim monk and i must talk divinity or something next door to it but the youth hath a good and a winning face and writeth greek like an angel well then my children to comprehend the ways of the church we should still rise a little above the earth since the church is between heaven and earth and interprets betwixt them the question is then not how vulgar men feel but how the common creator of man and beast doth feel towards the lower animals this if we are too proud to search for it in the lessons of the church the next best thing is to go to the most ancient history of men and animals colonna herodotus nay nay in this matter herodotus is but a mushroom finely were we sped for ancient history if we depended on your greeks who did but write on the last leaf of that great book antiquity the friar groaned here was a pope uttering heresy against his demigods tis the vulgate i speak of a history that handles matters three thousand years before him pedants call the father of history colonna oh the vulgate i cry your holiness mercy how you frightened me i quite forgot the vulgate forgot it art sure thou ever readst it francesco mio not quite your holiness tis a pleasure i have long promised myself the first vacant moment hitherto these grand old heathen have left me small time for recreation his holiness first then you will find in genesis that god having created the animals drew a holy pleasure undefinable by us from contemplating of their beauty was it wonderful see their myriad forms their lovely hair and eyes their grace and of some the power and majesty the colour of others brighter than roses or rubies and when for mans sin not their own they were destroyed yet were two of each kind spared and when the ark and its trembling inmates tumbled solitary on the world of water then saith the word god remembered noah and the cattle that were with him in the ark thereafter god did write his rainbow in the sky as a bond that earth should be flooded no more and between whom the bond between god and man nay between god and man and every living creature of all flesh or my memory fails me with age in exodus god commanded that the cattle should share the sweet blessing of the one days rest moreover he forbade to muzzle the ox that trod out the corn nay let the poor overwrought soul snatch a mouthful as he goes his toilsome round the bulk of the grain shall still be for man ye will object perchance that st paul commenting this saith rudely doth god care for oxen verily had i been peter instead of the humblest of his successors i had answered him drop thy theatrical poets paul and read the scriptures then shalt thou know whether god careth only for men and sparrows or for all his creatures o paul had i made bold to say think not to learn god by looking into pauls heart nor any heart of man but study that which he hath revealed concerning himself thrice he forbade the jews to boil the kid in his mothers milk not that this is cruelty but want of thought and gentle sentiments and so paves the way for downright cruelty a prophet riding on an ass did meet an angel which of these two paulo judice had seen the heavenly spirit marry the prophet but it was not so the man his vision cloyed with sin saw nought the poor despised creature saw all nor is this recorded as miraculous poor proud things we overrate ourselves the angel had slain the prophet and spared the ass but for that creatures clearer vision of essences divine he said so methinks but in sooth i read it many years agone why did god spare repentant nineveh because in that city were sixty thousand children besides much cattle profane history and vulgar experience add their mite of witness the cruel to animals end in cruelty to man and strange and violent deaths marked with retributions bloody finger have in all ages fallen from heaven on such as wantonly harm innocent beasts this i myself have seen all this duly weighed and seeing that despite this francescos friends the stoics who in their vanity say the creatures all subsist for mans comfort there be snakes and scorpions which kill dominum terra with a nip musquitoes which eat him piecemeal and tigers and sharks which crack him like an almond we do well to be grateful to these true faithful patient fourfooted friends which in lieu of powdering us put forth their strength to relieve our toils and do feed us like mothers from their gentle dugs methinks then the church is never more divine than in this benediction of our fourfooted friends which has revolted you great theological authority the captain of the popes guards since here she inculcates humility and gratitude and rises towards the level of the mind divine and interprets god to man god the creator parent and friend of man and beast but all this young gentles you will please to receive not as delivered by the pope ex cathedra but uttered carelessly in a free hour by an aged clergyman on that score you will perhaps do well to entertain it with some little consideration for old age must surely bring a man somewhat in return for his digestion his dura puerorum ilia eh francesco which it carries away such was the purport of the popes discourse but the manner high bred languid kindly and free from all tone of dictation he seemed to be gently probing the matter in concert with his hearers not playing sir oracle at the bottom of all which was doubtless a slight touch of humbug but the humbug that embellishes life and all sense of it was lost in the subtle italian grace of the thing i seem to hear the oracle of delphi said fra colonna enthusiastically i call that good sense shouted jacques bonaventura oh captain good sense said gerard with a deep and tender reproach the pope smiled on gerard cavil not at words that was an unheard of concession from a rival theologian he then asked for all gerards work and took it away in his hand but before going he gently pulled fra colonnas ear and asked him whether he remembered when they were schoolfellows together and robbed the virgin by the roadside of the money dropped into her box you took a flat stick and applied birdlime to the top and drew the money out through the chink you rogue said his holiness severely to every signor his own honour replied fra colonna it was your holinesss good wit invented the manoeuvre i was but the humble instrument it is well doubtless you know twas sacrilege of the first water but i did it in such good company it troubles me not humph i have not even that poor consolation what did we spend it in dost mind can your holiness ask why sugarplums what all ont every doit these are delightful reminiscences my francesco alas i am getting old i shall not be here long and i am sorry for it for thy sake they will go and burn thee when i am gone art far more a heretic than huss whom i saw burned with these eyes and oh he died like a martyr ay your holiness but i believe in the pope and huss did not fox they will not burn thee wood is too dear adieu old playmate adieu young gentlemen an old mans blessing be on you that afternoon the popes secretary brought gerard a little bag in it were several gold pieces he added them to his store margaret seemed nearer and nearer for some time past too it appeared as if the fairies had watched over him baskets of choice provisions and fruits were brought to his door by porters who knew not who had employed them or affected ignorance and one day came a jewel in a letter but no words chapter lxi the princess claelia ordered a fulllength portrait of herself gerard advised her to employ his friend pietro vanucci but she declined twill be time to put a slight on the gerardo when his work discontents me then gerard who knew he was an excellent draughtsman but not so good a colourist begged her to stand to him as a roman statue he showed her how closely he could mimic marble on paper she consented at first but demurred when this enthusiast explained to her that she must wear the tunic toga and sandals of the ancients why i had as lieve be presented in my smock said she with mediaeval frankness alack signorina said gerard you have surely never noted the ancient habit so free so ample so simple yet so noble and most becoming your highness to whom heaven hath given the roman features and eke a shapely arm and hand his in modern guise what can you flatter like the rest gerardo well give me time to think ont come o saturday and then i will say ay or nay the respite thus gained was passed in making the tunic and toga etc and trying them on in her chamber to see whether they suited her style of beauty well enough to compensate their being a thousand years out of date gerard hurrying along to this interview was suddenly arrested and rooted to earth at a shop window his quick eye had discerned in that window a copy of lactantius lying open that is fairly writ anyway thought he he eyed it a moment more with all his eyes it was not written at all it was printed gerard groaned i am sped mine enemy is at the door the press is in rome he went into the shop and affecting nonchalance inquired how long the printingpress had been in rome the man said he believed there was no such thing in the city oh the lactantius that was printed on the top of the apennines what did the printingpress fall down there out o the moon nay messer said the trader laughing it shot up there out of germany see the titlepage gerard took the lactantius eagerly and saw the following opera et impensis sweynheim et pannartz alumnorum joannis fust impressum subiacis ad will ye buy messer see how fair and even be the letters few are left can write like that and scarce a quarter of the price i would fain have it said gerard sadly but my heart will not let me know that i am a caligraph and these disciples of fust run after me round the world ataking the bread out of my mouth but i wish them no ill heaven forbid and he hurried from the shop dear margaret said he to himself we must lose no time we must make our hay while shines the sun one month more and an avalanche of printers type shall roll down on rome from those apennines and lay us waste that writers be and he almost ran to the princess claelia he was ushered into an apartment new to him it was not very large but most luxurious a fountain played in the centre and the floor was covered with the skins of panthers dressed with the hair so that no footfall could be heard the room was an antechamber to the princesss boudoir for on one side there was no door but an ample curtain of gorgeous tapestry here gerard was left alone till he became quite uneasy and doubted whether the maid had not shown him to the wrong place these doubts were agreeably dissipated a light step came swiftly behind the curtain it parted in the middle and there stood a figure the heathens might have worshipped it was not quite venus nor quite minerva but between the two nobler than venus more womanly than jupiters daughter toga tunic sandals nothing was modern and as for beauty that is of all times gerard started up and all the artist in him flushed with pleasure oh he cried innocently and gazed in rapture this added the last charm to his model a light blush tinted her cheeks and her eyes brightened and her mouth smiled with delicious complacency at this genuine tribute to her charms when they had looked at one another so some time and she saw gerards eloquence was confined to ejaculating and gazing she spoke well gerardo thou seest i have made myself an antique monster for thee a monster i doubt fra colonna would fall down and adore your highness seeing you so habited nay i care not to be adored by an old man i would liever be loved by a young one of my own choosing gerard took out his pencils arranged his canvas which he had covered with stout paper and set to work and so absorbed was he that he had no mercy on his model at last after near an hour in one posture gerardo said she faintly i can stand so no more even for thee sit down and rest awhile signora i thank thee said she and sinking into a chair turned pale and sighed gerard was alarmed and saw also he had been inconsiderate he took water from the fountain and was about to throw it in her face but she put up a white hand deprecatingly nay hold it to my brow with thine hand prithee do not fling it at me gerard timidly and hesitating applied his wet hand to her brow ah she sighed that is reviving again he applied it again she thanked him and asked him to ring a little handbell on the table he did so and a maid came and was sent to floretta with orders to bring a large fan floretta speedily came with the fan she no sooner came near the princess than that ladys highbred nostrils suddenly expanded like a bloodhorses wretch said she and rising up with a sudden return to vigour seized floretta with her left hand twisted it in her hair and with the right hand boxed her ears severely three times floretta screamed and blubbered but obtained no mercy the antique toga left quite disengaged a bare arm that now seemed as powerful as it was beautiful it rose and fell like the piston of a modern steamengine and heavy slaps resounded one after another on florettas shoulders the last one drove her sobbing and screaming through the curtain and there she was heard crying bitterly for some time after saints of heaven cried gerard what is amiss what has she done she knows right well tis not the first time the nasty toad ill learn her to come to me stinking of the muskcat alas signora twas a small fault methinks a small fault nay twas a foul fault she added with an amazing sudden descent to humility and sweetness are you wroth with me for beating her gerardo signora it ill becomes me to school you but methinks such as heaven appoints to govern others should govern themselves that is true gerardo how wise you are to be so young she then called the other maid and gave her a little purse take that to floretta and tell her the gerardo hath interceded for her and so i must needs forgive her there gerardo gerard coloured all over at the compliment but not knowing how to turn a phrase equal to the occasion asked her if he should resume her picture not yet beating that hussy hath somewhat breathed me ill sit awhile and you shall talk to me i know you can talk an it pleases you as rarely as you draw that were easily done do it then gerardo gerard was taken aback but signora i know not what to say this is sudden say your real mind say you wish you were anywhere but here nay signora that would not be sooth i wish one thing though ay and what is that said she gently i wish i could have drawn you as you were beating that poor lass you were awful yet lovely oh what a subject for a pythoness alas he thinks but of his art and why keep such a coil about my beauty gerardo you are far fairer than i am you are more like apollo than i to venus also you have lovely hair and lovely eyesbut you know not what to do with them ay do i to draw you signora ah yes you can see my features with them but you cannot see what any roman gallant had seen long ago in your place yet sure you must have noted how welcome you are to me gerardo i can see your highness is always passing kind to me a poor stranger like me no i am not gerardo i have often been cold to you rude sometimes and you are so simple you see not the cause alas i feared for my own heart i feared to be your slave i who have hitherto made slaves ah gerardo i am unhappy ever since you came here i have lived upon your visits the day you are to come i am bright the other days i am listless and wish them fled you are not like the roman gallants you make me hate them you are ten times braver to my eye and you are wise and scholarly and never flatter and lie i scorn a man that lies gerardo teach me thy magic teach me to make thee as happy by my side as i am still by thine as she poured out these strange words the princesss mellow voice sunk almost to a whisper and trembled with halfsuppressed passion and her white hand stole timidly yet earnestly down gerards arm till it rested like a soft bird upon his wrist and as ready to fly away at a word destitute of vanity and experience wrapped up in his margaret and his art gerard had not seen this revelation coming though it had come by regular and visible gradations he blushed all over his innocent admiration of the regal beauty that besieged him did not for a moment displace the absent margarets image yet it was regal beauty and wooing with a grace and tenderness he had never even figured in imagination how to check her without wounding her he blushed and trembled the siren saw and encouraged him poor gerardo she murmured fear not none shall ever harm thee under my wing wilt not speak to me gerardo mio signora muttered gerard deprecatingly at this moment his eye lowered in his confusion fell on the shapely white arm and delicate hand that curled round his elbow like a tender vine and it flashed across him how he had just seen that lovely limb employed on floretta he trembled and blushed alas said the princess i scare him am i then so very terrible is it my roman robe ill doff it and habit me as when thou first camest to me mindest thou twas to write a letter to yon barren knight ercole dorsini shall i tell thee twas the sight of thee and thy pretty ways and thy wise words made me hate him on the instant i liked the fool well enough before or wist i liked him tell me now how many times hast thou been here since then ah thou knowest not lovest me not i doubt as i love thee eighteen times gerardo and each time dearer to me the day thou comest not tis night not day to claelia alas i speak for both cruel boy am i not worth a word hast every day a princess at thy feet nay prithee prithee speak to me gerardo signora faltered gerard what can i say that were not better left unsaid oh evil day that ever i came here ah say not so twas the brightest day ever shone on me or indeed on thee ill make thee confess so much ere long ungrateful one your highness began gerard in a low pleading voice call me claelia gerardo signora i am too young and too little wise to know how i ought to speak to you so as not to seem blind nor yet ungrateful but this i know i were both naught and ungrateful and the worst foe eer you had did i take advantage of this mad fancy sure some ill spirit hath had leave to afflict you withal for tis all unnatural that a princess adorned with every grace should abase her affections on a churl the princess withdrew her hand slowly from gerards wrist yet as it passed lightly over his arm it seemed to linger a moment at parting you fear the daggers of my kinsmen said she half sadly half contemptuously no more than i fear the bodkins of your women said gerard haughtily but i fear god and the saints and my own conscience the truth gerardo the truth hypocrisy sits awkwardly on thee princesses while they are young are not despised for love of god but of some other woman tell me whom thou lovest and if she is worthy thee i will forgive thee no she in italy upon my soul ah there is one somewhere then where where in holland my native country ah marie de bourgoyne is fair they say yet she is but a child princess she i love is not noble she is as i am nor is she so fair as thou yet is she fair and linked to my heart for ever by her virtues and by all the dangers and griefs we have borne together and for one another forgive me but i would not wrong my margaret for all the highest dames in italy the slighted beauty started to her feet and stood opposite him as beautiful but far more terrible than when she slapped floretta for then her cheeks were red but now they were pale and her eyes full of concentrated fury this to my face unmannered wretch she cried was i born to be insulted as well as scorned by such as thou beware we nobles brook no rivals bethink thee whether is better the love of a cesarini or her hate for after all i have said and done to thee it must be love or hate between us and to the death choose now he looked up at her with wonder and awe as she stood towering over him in her roman toga offering this strange alternative he seemed to have affronted a goddess of antiquity he a poor puny mortal he sighed deeply but spoke not perhaps something in his deep and patient sigh touched a tender chord in that ungoverned creature or perhaps the time had come for one passion to ebb and another to flow the princess sank languidly into a seat and the tears began to steal rapidly down her cheeks alas alas said gerard weep not sweet lady your tears they do accuse me and i am like to weep for company my kind patron be yourself you will live to see how much better a friend i was to you than i seemed i see it now gerardo said the princess friend is the word the only word can ever pass between us twain i was mad any other man had taen advantage of my folly you must teach me to be your friend and nothing more gerard hailed this proposition with joy and told her out of cicero how godlike a thing was friendship and how much better and rarer and more lasting than love to prove to her he was capable of it he even told her about denys and himself she listened with her eyes half shut watching his words to fathom his character and learn his weak point at last she addressed him calmly thus leave me now gerardo and come as usual tomorrow you will find your lesson well bestowed she held out her hand to him he kissed it and went away pondering deeply this strange interview and wondering whether he had done prudently or not the next day he was received with marked distance and the princess stood before him literally like a statue and after a very short sitting excused herself and dismissed him gerard felt the chilling difference but said to himself she is wise so she was in her way the next day he found the princess waiting for him surrounded by young nobles flattering her to the skies she and they treated him like a dog that could do one little trick they could not the cavaliers in particular criticised his work with a mass of ignorance and insolence combined that made his cheeks burn the princess watched his face demurely with halfclosed eyes at each sting the insects gave him and when they had fled had her doors closed against every one of them for their pains the next day gerard found her alone cold and silent after standing to him so some time she said you treated my company with less respect than became you did i signora did you you fired up at the comments they did you the honour to make on your work nay i said nought observed gerard oh high looks speak as plain as high words your cheeks were red as blood i was nettled a moment at seeing so much ignorance and illnature together now it is me their hostess you affront forgive me signora and acquit me of design it would ill become me to affront the kindest patron and friend i have in rome but one how humble we are all of a sudden in sooth ser gerardo you are a capital feigner you can insult or truckle at will truckle to whom to me for one to one whom you affronted for a baseborn girl like yourself but whose patronage you claim all the same gerard rose and put his hand to his heart these are biting words signora have i really deserved them oh what are words to an adventurer like you cold steel is all you fear i am no swashbuckler yet i have met steel with steel and methinks i had rather face your kinsmens swords than your cruel tongue lady why do you use me so gerardo for no good reason but because i am wayward and shrewish and curst and because everybody admires me but you i admire you too signora your friends may flatter you more but believe me they have not the eye to see half your charms their babble yesterday showed me that none admire you more truly or wish you better than the poor artist who might not be your lover but hoped to be your friend but no i see that may not be between one so high as you and one so low as i ay but it shall gerardo said the princess eagerly i will not be so curst tell me now where abides thy margaret and i will give thee a present for her and on that you and i will be friends she is a daughter of a physician called peter and they bide at sevenbergen ah me shall i eer see it again tis well now go and she dismissed him somewhat abruptly poor gerard he began to wade in deep waters when he encountered this italian princess callida et calida selis filia he resolved to go no more when once he had finished her likeness indeed he now regretted having undertaken so long and laborious a task this resolution was shaken for a moment by his next reception which was all gentleness and kindness after standing to him some time in her toga she said she was fatigued and wanted his assistance in another way would he teach her to draw a little he sat down beside her and taught her to make easy lines he found her wonderfully apt he said so i had a teacher before thee gerardo ay and one as handsome as thyself she then went to a drawer and brought out several heads drawn with a complete ignorance of the art but with great patience and natural talent they were all heads of gerard and full of spirit and really not unlike one was his very image there said she now thou seest who was my teacher not i signora what know you not who teaches us women to do all things tis love gerardo love made me draw because thou draweth gerardo love prints thine image in my bosom my fingers touch the pen and love supplies the want of art and lo thy beloved features lie upon the paper gerard opened his eyes with astonishment at this return to an interdicted topic oh signora you promised me to be friends and nothing more she laughed in his face how simple you are who believes a woman promising nonsense impossibilities friendship foolish boy who ever built that temple on red ashes nay gerardo she added gloomily between thee and me it must be love or hate which you will signora said gerard firmly but for me i will neither love nor hate you but with your permission i will leave you and he rose abruptly she rose too pale as death and said ere thou leavest me so know thy fate outside that door are armed men who wait to slay thee at a word from me but you will not speak that word signora that word i will speak nay more i shall noise it abroad it was for proffering brutal love to me thou wert slain and i will send a special messenger to sevenbergen a cunning messenger well taught his lesson thy margaret shall know thee dead and think thee faithless now go to thy grave a dogs for a man thou art not gerard turned pale and stood dumbstricken god have mercy on us both nay have thou mercy on her and on thyself she will never know in holland what thou dost in rome unless i be driven to tell her my tale come yield thee gerardo mio what will it cost thee to say thou lovest me i ask thee but to feign it handsomely thou art young die not for the poor pleasure of denying a lady whatthe shadow of a heart who will shed a tear for thee i tell thee men will laugh not weep over thy tombstoneah she ended in a little scream for gerard threw himself in a moment at her feet and poured out in one torrent of eloquence the story of his love and margarets how he had been imprisoned hunted with bloodhounds for her driven to exile for her how she had shed her blood for him and now pined at home how he had walked through europe environed by perils torn by savage brutes attacked by furious men with sword and axe and trap robbed shipwrecked for her the princess trembled and tried to get away from him but he held her robe he clung to her he made her hear his pitiful story and margarets he caught her hand and clasped it between both his and his tears fell fast on her hand as he implored her to think on all the woes of the true lovers she would part and what but remorse swift and lasting could come of so deep a love betrayed and so false a love feigned with mutual hatred lurking at the bottom in such moments none ever resisted gerard the princess after in vain trying to get away from him for she felt his power over her began to waver and sigh and her bosom to rise and fall tumultuously and her fiery eyes to fill you conquer me she sobbed you or my better angel leave rome i will i will if you breathe a word of my folly it will be your last think not so poorly of me you are my benefactress once more is it for me to slander you go i will send you the means i know myself if you cross my path again i shall kill you addio my heart is broken she touched her bell floretta said she in a choked voice take him safe out of the house through my chamber and by the side postern he turned at the door she was leaning with one hand on a chair crying with averted head then he thought only of her kindness and ran back and kissed her robe she never moved once clear of the house he darted home thanking heaven for his escape soul and body landlady said he there is one would pick a quarrel with me what is to be done strike him first and at vantage get behind him and then draw alas i lack your italian courage to be serious tis a noble oh holy saints that is another matter change thy lodging awhile and keep snug and alter the fashion of thy habits she then took him to her own niece who let lodgings at some little distance and installed him there he had little to do now and no princess to draw so he set himself resolutely to read that deed of floris brandt from which he had hitherto been driven by the abominably bad writing he mastered it and saw at once that the loan on this land must have been paid over and over again by the rents and that ghysbrecht was keeping peter brandt out of his own fool not to have read this before he cried he hired a horse and rode down to the nearest port a vessel was to sail for amsterdam in four days he took a passage and paid a small sum to secure it the land is too full of cutthroats for me said he and tis lovely fair weather for the sea our dutch skippers are not shipwrecked like these bungling italians when he returned home there sat his old landlady with her eyes sparkling you are in luck my young master said she all the fish run to your net this day methinks see what a lackey hath brought to our house this bill and this bag gerard broke the seals and found it full of silver crowns the letter contained a mere slip of paper with this line cut out of some msla lingua non ha osso ma fa rompere il dosso fear me not said gerard aloud ill keep mine between my teeth what is that oh nothing am i not happy dame i am going back to my sweetheart with money in one pocket and land in the other and he fell to dancing round her well said she i trow nothing could make you happier nothing except to be there well that is a pity for i thought to make you a little happier with a letter from holland a letter for me where how who brought itoh dame a stranger a painter with a reddish face and an outlandish name anselmin i trow hans memling a friend of mine god bless him ay that is it anselmin he could scarce speak a word but a had the wit to name thee and a puts the letter down and a nods and smiles and i nods and smiles and gives him a pint o wine and it went down him like a spoonful that is hans honest hans oh dame i am in luck today but i deserve it for i care not if i tell you i have just overcome a great temptation for dear margarets sake who is she nay id have my tongue cut out sooner than betray her but oh it was a temptation gratitude pushing me wrong beauty almost divine pulling me wrong curses reproaches and hardest of all to resist gentle tears from eyes used to command sure some saint helped me anthony belike but my reward is come ay is it lad and no farther off than my pocket come out gerards reward and she brought a letter out of her capacious pocket gerard threw his arm round her neck and hugged her my best friend said he my second mother ill read it to you ay do do alas it is not from margaret this is not her hand and he turned it about alack but maybe her bill is within the lasses are aye for gliding in their bills under cover of another hand true whose hand is this sure i have seen it i trow tis my dear friend the demoiselle van eyck oh then margarets bill will be inside he tore it open nay tis all in one writing gerard my well beloved son she never called me that before that i mind this letter brings thee heavy news from one would liever send thee joyful tidings know that margaret brandt died in these arms on thursday sennight last what does the doting old woman mean by that the last word on her lips was gerard she said tell him i prayed for him at my last hour and bid him pray for me she died very comfortable and i saw her laid in the earth for her father was useless as you shall know so no more at present from her that is with sorrowing heart thy loving friend and servant margaret van eyck ay that is her signature sure enough now what dye think of that dame cried gerard with a grating laugh there is a pretty letter to send to a poor fellow so far from home but it is reicht heynes i blame for humouring the old woman and letting her do it as for the old woman herself she dotes she has lost her head she is fourscore oh my heart im choking for all that she ought to be locked up or her hands tied say this had come to a fool say i was idiot enough to believe this know ye what i should do run to the top of the highest church tower in rome and fling myself off it cursing heaven woman woman what are you doing and he seized her rudely by the shoulder what are ye weeping for he cried in a voice all unlike his own and loud and hoarse as a raven would ye scald me to death with your tears she believes it she believes it ah ah ah ah ah ahthen there is no god the poor woman sighed and rocked herself and must be the one to bring it thee all smiling and smirking i could kill myself fort death spares none she sobbed death spares none gerard staggered against the window sill but he is master of death he groaned or they have taught me a lie i begin to fear there is no god and the saints are but dead bones and hell is master of the world my pretty margaret my sweet my loving margaret the best daughter the truest lover the pride of holland the darling of the world it is a lie where is this caitiff hans ill hunt him round the town ill cram his murdering falsehood down his throat and he seized his hat and ran furiously about the streets for hours towards sunset he came back white as a ghost he had not found memling but his poor mind had had time to realise the womans simple words that death spares none he crept into the house bent and feeble as an old man and refused all food nor would he speak but sat white with great staring eyes muttering at intervals there is no god alarmed both on his account and on her own for he looked a desperate maniac his landlady ran for her aunt the good dame came and the two women braver together sat one on each side of him and tried to soothe him with kind and consoling voices but he heeded them no more than the chairs they sat on then the younger held a crucifix out before him to aid her maria mother of heaven comfort him they sighed but he sat glaring deaf to all external sounds presently without any warning he jumped up struck the crucifix rudely out of his way with a curse and made a headlong dash at the door the poor women shrieked but ere he reached the door something seemed to them to draw him up straight by his hair and twirl him round like a top he whirled twice round with arms extended then fell like a dead log upon the floor with blood trickling from his nostrils and ears chapter xlii gerard returned to consciousness and to despair on the second day he was raving with fever on the brain on a table hard by lay his rich auburn hair long as a womans the deadlier symptoms succeeded one another rapidly on the fifth day his leech retired and gave him up on the sunset of that same day he fell into a deep sleep some said he would wake only to die but an old gossip whose opinion carried weight she had been a professional nurse declared that his youth might save him yet could he sleep twelve hours on this his old landlady cleared the room and watched him alone she vowed a wax candle to the virgin for every hour he should sleep he slept twelve hours the good soul rejoiced and thanked the virgin on her knees he slept twentyfour hours his kind nurse began to doubt at the thirtieth hour she sent for the woman of art thirty hours shall we wake him the other inspected him closely for some time his breath is even his hand moist i know there be learned leeches would wake him to look at his tongue and be none the wiser but we that be women should have the sense to let bon nature alone when did sleep ever harm the racked brain or the torn heart when he had been fortyeight hours asleep it got wind and they had much ado to keep the curious out but they admitted only fra colonna and his friend the gigantic fra jerome these two relieved the women and sat silent the former eyeing his young friend with tears in his eyes the latter with beads in his hand looked as calmly on him as he had on the sea when gerard and he encountered it hand to hand at last i think it was about the sixtieth hour of this strange sleep the landlady touched fra colonna with her elbow he looked gerard had opened his eyes as gently as if he had been but dozing he stared he drew himself up a little in bed he put his hand to his head and found his hair was gone he noticed his friend colonna and smiled with pleasure but in the middle of smiling his face stopped and was convulsed in a moment with anguish unspeakable and he uttered a loud cry and turned his face to the wall his good landlady wept at this she had known what it is to awake bereaved fra jerome recited canticles and prayers from his breviary gerard rolled himself in the bedclothes fra colonna went to him and whimpering reminded him that all was not lost the divine muses were immortal he must transfer his affection to them they would never betray him nor fail him like creatures of clay the good simple father then hurried away for he was overcome by his emotion fra jerome remained behind young man said he the muses exist but in the brains of pagans and visionaries the church alone gives repose to the heart on earth and happiness to the soul hereafter hath earth deceived thee hath passion broken thy heart after tearing it the church opens her arms consecrate thy gifts to her the church is peace of mind he spoke these words solemnly at the door and was gone as soon as they were uttered the church cried gerard rising furiously and shaking his fist after the friar malediction on the church but for the church i should not lie broken here and she lie cold cold cold in holland oh my margaret oh my darling my darling and i must run from thee the few months thou hadst to live cruel cruel the monsters they let her die death comes not without some signs these the blind selfish wretches saw not or recked not but i had seen them i that love her oh had i been there i had saved her i had saved her idiot idiot to leave her for a moment he wept bitterly a long time then suddenly bursting into rage again he cried vehemently the church for whose sake i was driven from her my malison be on the church and the hypocrites that name it to my broken heart accursed be the world ghysbrecht lives margaret dies thieves murderers harlots live for ever only angels die curse life curse death and whosoever made them what they are the friar did not hear these mad and wicked words but only the yell of rage with which they were flung after him it was as well for if he had heard them he would have had his late shipmate burned in the forum with as little hesitation as he would have roasted a kid his old landlady who had accompanied fra colonna down the stair heard the raised voice and returned in some anxiety she found gerard putting on his clothes and crying she remonstrated what avails my lying here said he gloomily can i find here that which i seek saints preserve us is he distraught again what seek ye oblivion oblivion my little heart oh but yare young to talk so young or old what else have i to live for he put on his best clothes the good dame remonstrated my pretty gerard know that it is tuesday not sunday oh tuesday is it i thought it had been saturday nay thou hast slept long thou never wearest thy brave clothes on working days consider what i did when she lived i did now i shall do whatever erst i did not the past is the past there lies my hair and with it my way of life i have served one master as well as i could you see my reward now ill serve another and give him a fair trial too alas sighed the woman turning pale what mean these dark words and what new master is this whose service thou wouldst try satan and with this horrible declaration on his lips the miserable creature walked out with his cap and feather set jauntily on one side and feeble limbs and a sinister face pale as ashes and all drawn down as if by age chapter lxiii a dark cloud fell on a noble mind his pure and unrivalled love for margaret had been his polar star it was quenched and he drifted on the gloomy sea of no hope nor was he a prey to despair alone but to exasperation at all his selfdenial fortitude perils virtue wasted and worse than wasted for it kept burning and stinging him that had he stayed lazily selfishly at home he should have saved his margarets life these two poisons raging together in his young blood maddened and demoralized him he rushed fiercely into pleasure and in those days even more than now pleasure was vice wine women gambling whatever could procure him an hours excitement and a moments oblivion he plunged into these things as men tired of life have rushed among the enemys bullets the large sums he had put by for margaret gave him ample means for debauchery and he was soon the leader of those loose companions he had hitherto kept at a distance his heart deteriorated along with his morals he sulked with his old landlady for thrusting gentle advice and warning on him and finally removed to another part of the town to be clear of remonstrance and reminiscences when he had carried this game on some time his hand became less steady and he could no longer write to satisfy himself moreover his patience declined as the habits of pleasure grew on him so he gave up that art and took likenesses in colours but this he neglected whenever the idle rakes his companions came for him and so he dived in foul waters seeking that sorry oystershell oblivion it is not my business to paint at full length the scenes of coarse vice in which this unhappy young man now played a part but it is my business to impress the broad truth that he was a rake a debauchee and a drunkard and one of the wildest loosest and wickedest young men in rome they are no lovers of truth nor of mankind who conceal or slur the wickedness of the good and so by their want of candour rob despondent sinners of hope enough the man was not born to do things by halves and he was not vicious by halves his humble female friends often gossiped about him his old landlady told teresa he was going to the bad and prayed her to try and find out where he was teresa told her husband lodovico his sad story and bade him look about and see if he could discover the young mans present abode shouldst remember his face lodovico mio teresa a man in my way of life never forgets a face least of all a benefactors but thou knowest i seldom go abroad by daylight teresa sighed and how long is it to be so lodovico till some cavalier passes his sword through me they will not let a poor fellow like me take to any honest trade pietro vanucci was one of those who bear prosperity worse than adversity having been ignominiously ejected for late hours by their old landlady and meeting gerard in the street he greeted him warmly and soon after took up his quarters in the same house he brought with him a lad called andrea who ground his colours and was his pupil and also his model being a youth of rare beauty and as sharp as a needle pietro had not quite forgotten old times and professed a warm friendship for gerard gerard in whom all warmth of sentiment seemed extinct submitted coldly to the others friendship and a fine acquaintance it was this pietro was not only a libertine but half a misanthrope and an open infidel and so they ran in couples with mighty little in common o rare phenomenon one day when gerard had undermined his health and taken the bloom off his beauty and run through most of his money vanucci got up a gay party to mount the tiber in a boat drawn by buffaloes lorenzo de medici had imported these creatures into florence about three years before but they were new in rome and nothing would content this beggar on horseback vanucci but being drawn by the brutes up the tiber each libertine was to bring a lady and she must be handsome or he be fined but the one that should contribute the loveliest was to be crowned with laurel and voted a public benefactor such was their reading of vir bonus est quis they got a splendid galley and twelve buffaloes and all the libertines and their female accomplices assembled by degrees at the place of embarkation but no gerard they waited for him some time at first patiently then impatiently vanucci excused him i heard him say he had forgotten to provide himself with a fardingale comrades the good lad is hunting for a beauty fit to take rank among these peerless dames consider the difficulty ladies and be patient at last gerard was seen at some distance with a female in his hand she is long enough said one of her sex criticising her from afar gemini what steps she takes said another oh it is wise to hurry into good company was pietros excuse but when the pair came up satire was choked gerards companion was a peerless beauty she extinguished the boatload as stars the rising sun tall but not too tall and straight as a dart yet supple as a young panther her face a perfect oval her forehead white her cheeks a rich olive with the eloquent blood mantling below and her glorious eyes fringed with long thick silken eyelashes that seemed made to sweep up sensitive hearts by the half dozen saucy red lips and teeth of the whitest ivory the women were visibly depressed by this wretched sight the men in ecstasies they received her with loud shouts and waving of caps and one enthusiast even went down on his knees upon the boats gunwale and hailed her of origin divine but his chere amie pulling his hair for itand the goddess giving him a little kickcotemporaneously he lay supine and the peerless creature frisked over his body without deigning him a look and took her seat at the prow pietro vanucci sat in a sort of collapse glaring at her and gaping with his mouth open like a dying codfish the drover spoke to the buffaloes the ropes tightened and they moved up stream what think ye of this new beef mesdames we neer saw monsters so viley illfavoured with their nasty horns that make one afeard and their foul nostrils cast up into the air holes be they not nostrils signorina the beeves are a present from florence the beautiful would ye look a gift beef i the nose they are so dull objected a lively lady i went up tiber twice as fast last time with but five mules and an ass nay that is soon mended cried a gallant and jumping ashore he drew his sword and despite the remonstrances of the drivers went down the dozen buffaloes goading them they snorted and whisked their tails and went no faster at which the boatload laughed loud and long finally he goaded a patriarch bull who turned instantly on the sword sent his long horns clean through the spark and with a furious jerk of his prodigious neck sent him flying over his head into the air he described a bold parabola and fell sitting and unconsciously waving his glittering blade into the yellow tiber the laughing ladies screamed and wrung their hands all but gerards fair she uttered something very like an oath and seizing the helm steered the boat out and the gallant came up sputtering griped the gunwale and was drawn in dripping he glared round him confusedly i understand not that said he a little peevishly puzzled and therefore it would seem discontented at which finding he was by some strange accident not slain his doublet being perforated instead of his body they began to laugh again louder than ever what are ye cackling at remonstrated the spark i desire to know how tis that one moment a gentleman is out yonder a pricking of african beef and the next moment gerards lady disporting in his native stream tell him not a soul of ye cried vanucci let him find out s own riddle confound ye all i might puzzle my brains till doomsday i should neer find it out also where is my sword gerards lady ask tiber your best way signor will be to do it over again and in a word keep pricking of africs beef till your mind receives light so shall you comprehend the matter by degrees as lawyers mount heaven and buffaloes tiber here a chevalier remarked that the last speaker transcended the sons of adam as much in wit as she did the daughters of eve in beauty at which and indeed at all their compliments the conduct of pietro vanucci was peculiar that signor had left off staring and gaping bewildered and now sat coiled up snakelike on each his mouth muffled and two bright eyes fixed on the lady and twinkling and scintillating most comically he did not appear to interest or amuse her in return her glorious eyes and eyelashes swept him calmly at times but scarce distinguished him from the benches and things presently the unanimity of the party suffered a momentary check mortified by the attention the cavaliers paid to gerards companion the ladies began to pick her to pieces sotto voce and audibly the lovely girl then showed that if rich in beauty she was poor in feminine tact instead of revenging herself like a true woman through the men she permitted herself to overhear and openly retaliate on her detractors there is not one of you that wears natures colours said she look here and she pointed rudely in ones face this is the beauty that is to be bought in every shop here is cerussa here is stibium and here purpurissum oh i know the articles bless you i use them every daybut not on my face no thank you here vanuccis eyes twinkled themselves nearly out of sight why your lips are coloured and the very veins in your forehead not a charm but would come off with a wet towel and look at your great coarse black hair like a horses tail drugged and stained to look like tow and then your bodies are as false as your heads and your cheeks and your hearts i trow look at your padded bosoms and your wooden heeled chopines to raise your little stunted limbs up and deceive the world skinny dwarfs ye are cushioned and stultified into great fat giants aha mesdames well is it said of you grandedi legni grossedi straci rossedi bettito bianchedi calcina this drew out a rejoinder avaunt vulgar toad telling the men everything your coarse ruddy cheeks are your own and your little handful of african hair but who is padded more why you are shaped like a fireshovel ye lie malapert oh the welleducated young person where didst pick her up ser gerard hold thy peace marcia said gerard awakened by the raised trebles from a gloomy reverie be not so insolent the grave shall close over thy beauty as it hath over fairer than thee they began said marcia petulantly then be thou the first to leave off at thy request my friend she then whispered gerard it was only to make you laugh you are distraught you are sad judge whether i care for the quips of these little fools or the admiration of these big fools dear signor gerard would i were what they take me for you should not be so sad gerard sighed deeply and shook his head but touched by the earnest young tones caressed the jet black locks much as one strokes the head of an affectionate dog at this moment a galley drifting slowly down stream got entangled for an instant in their ropes for the river turning suddenly they had shot out into the stream and this galley came between them and the bank in it a lady of great beauty was seated under a canopy with gallants and dependents standing behind her gerard looked up at the interruption it was the princess claelia he coloured and withdrew his hand from marcias head marcia was all admiration aha ladies said she here is a rival an ye will those cheeks were coloured by naturelike mine peace child peace said gerard make not too free with the great why she heard me not oh ser gerard what a lovely creature two of the females had been for some time past putting their heads together and casting glances at marcia one of them now addressed her signorina do you love almonds the speaker had a lapful of them yes i love them when i can get them said marcia pettishly and eyeing the fruit with illconcealed desire but yours is not the hand to give me any i trow you are much mistook said the other here catch and suddenly threw a double handful into marcias lap marcia brought her knees together by an irresistible instinct aha you are caught my lad cried she of the nuts tis a man or a boy a woman still parteth her knees to catch the nuts the surer in her apron but a man closeth his for fear they should all between his hose confess now didst never wear fardingale ere today give me another handful sweetheart and ill tell thee there i said he was too handsome for a woman ser gerard they have found me out observed the epicaene calmly cracking an almond the libertines vowed it was impossible and all glared at the goddess like a battery but vanucci struck in and reminded the gaping gazers of a recent controversy in which they had with a unanimity not often found among dunces laughed gerard and him to scorn for saying that men were as beautiful as women in a true artists eye where are ye now this is my boy andrea and you have all been down on your knees to him ha ha but oh my little ladies when he lectured you and flung your stibium your cerussa and your purpurissum back in your faces tis then i was like to burst a grinds my colours ha ha he he he ho the little impostor duck him what for signors cried andrea in dismay and lost his rich carnation but the females collected round him and vowed nobody should harm a hair of his head the dear child how well his pretty little saucy ways become him oh what eyes and teeth and what eyebrows and hair and what lashes and what a nose the sweetest little ear in the world and what health touch but his cheek with a pin the blood should squirt who would be so cruel he is a rosebud washed in dew and they revenged themselves for their beaux admiration of her by lavishing all their tenderness on him but one there was who was still among these butterflies but no longer of them the sight of the princess claelia had torn open his wound scarce three months ago he had declined the love of that peerless creature a love illicit and insane but at least refined how much lower had he fallen now how happy he must have been when the blandishments of claelia that might have melted an anchorite could not tempt him from the path of loyalty now what was he he had blushed at her seeing him in such company yet it was his daily company he hung over the boat in moody silence and from that hour another phase of his misery began and grew upon him some wretched fools try to drown care in drink the fumes of intoxication vanish the inevitable care remains and must be faced at lastwith an aching head disordered stomach and spirits artificially depressed gerards conduct had been of a piece with these maniacs to survive his terrible blow he needed all his forces his virtue his health his habits of labour and the calm sleep that is labours satellite above all his piety yet all these balms to wounded hearts he flung away and trusted to moral intoxication its brief fumes fled the bereaved heart lay still heavy as lead within his bosom but now the dark vulture remorse sat upon it rending it broken health means wasted innocence fled margaret parted from him by another gulf wider than the grave the hot fit of despair passed away the cold fit of despair came on then this miserable young man spurned his gay companions and all the world he wandered alone he drank wine alone to stupefy himself and paralyze a moment the dark foes to man that preyed upon his soul he wandered alone amidst the temples of old rome and lay stony eyed woebegone among their ruins worse wrecked than they last of all came the climax to which solitude that gloomy yet fascinating foe of minds diseased pushes the hopeless he wandered alone at night by dark streams and eyed them and eyed them with decreasing repugnance there glided peace perhaps annihilation what else was left him these dark spells have been broken by kind words by loving and cheerful voices the humblest friend the afflicted one possesses may speak or look or smile a sunbeam between him and that worst madness gerard now brooded where was teresa where his hearty kind old landlady they would see with their homely but swift intelligence they would see and save no they knew not where he was or whither he was gliding and is there no mortal eye upon the poor wretch and the dark road he is going yes one eye there is upon him watching his every movement following him abroad tracking him home and that eye is the eye of an enemy an enemy to the death chapter lxiv in an apartment richly furnished the floor covered with striped and spotted skins of animals a lady sat with her arms extended before her and her hands half clenched the agitation of her face corresponded with this attitude she was pale and red by turns and her foot restless presently the curtain was drawn by a domestic the ladys brow flushed the maid said in an awestruck whisper altezza the man is here the lady bade her admit him and snatched up a little black mask and put it on and in a moment her colour was gone and the contrast between her black mask and her marble cheeks was strange and fearful a man entered bowing and scraping it was such a figure as crowds seem made of short hair roundish head plain but decent clothes features neither comely not forbidding nothing to remark in him but a singularly restless eye after a profusion of bows he stood opposite the lady and awaited her pleasure they have told you for what you are wanted yes signora did those who spoke to you agree as to what you are to receive yes signora tis the full price and purchases the greater vendetta unless of your benevolence you choose to content yourself with the lesser i understand you not said the lady ah this is the signoras first the lesser vendetta lady is the death of the body only we watch our man come out of a church or take him in an innocent hour and so deal with him in the greater vendetta we watch him and catch him hot from some unrepented sin and so slay his soul as well as his body but this vendetta is not so run upon now as it was a few years ago man silence me his tongue and let his treasonable heart beat no more but his soul i have no feud with so be it signora he who spoke to me knew not the man nor his name nor his abode from whom shall i learn these from myself at this the man with the first symptoms of anxiety he had shown entreated her to be cautious and particular in this part of the business fear me not said she listen it is a young man tall of stature and auburn hair and dark blue eyes and an honest face would deceive a saint he lives in the via claudia at the corner house the glovers in that house there lodge but three males he and a painter short of stature and dark visaged and a young slim boy he that hath betrayed me is a stranger fair and taller than thou art the bravo listened with all his ears it is enough said he stay signora haunteth he any secret place where i may deal with him my spy doth report me he hath of late frequented the banks of tiber after dusk doubtless to meet his light o love who calls me her rival even there slay him and let my rival come and find him the smooth heartless insolent traitor be calm signora he will betray no more ladies i know not that he weareth a sword and can use it he is young and resolute neither will avail him are ye so sure of your hand what are your weapons the bravo showed her a steel gauntlet we strike with such force we need must guard our hand this is our mallet he then undid his doublet and gave her a glimpse of a coat of mail beneath and finally laid his glittering stiletto on the table with a flourish the lady shuddered at first but presently took it up in her white hand and tried its point against her finger beware madam said the bravo what is it poisoned saints forbid we steal no lives we take them with steel point not drugs but tis newly ground and i feared for the signoras white skin his skin is as white as mine said she with a sudden gleam of pity it lasted but a moment but his heart is black as soot say do i not well to remove a traitor that slanders me the signora will settle that with her confessor i am but a tool in noble hands like my stiletto the princess appeared not to hear the speaker oh how i could have loved him to the death as now i hate him fool he will learn to trifle with princes to spurn them and fawn on them and prefer the scum of the town to them and make them a byword she looked up why loiterst thou here haste thee revenge me it is customary to pay half the price beforehand signora ah i forgot thy revenge is bought here is more than half and she pushed a bag across the table to him when the blow is struck come for the rest you will soon see me again signora and he retired bowing and scraping the princess burning with jealousy mortified pride and dread of exposure for till she knew gerard no public stain had fallen on her sat where he left her masked with her arms straight out before her and the nails of her clenched hand nipping the table so sat the fabled sphynx so sits a tigress yet there crept a chill upon her now that the assassin was gone and moody misgivings heaved within her precursors of vain remorse gerard and margaret were before their age this was your true mediaeval proud amorous vindictive generous foolish cunning impulsive unprincipled and ignorant as dirt power is the curse of such a creature forced to do her own crimes the weakness of her nerves would have balanced the violence of her passions and her bark been worse than her bite but power gives a feeble furious woman male instruments and the effect is as terrible as the combination is unnatural in this instance it whetted an assassins dagger for a poor forlorn wretch just meditating suicide chapter lxv it happened two days after the scene i have endeavoured to describe that gerard wandering through one of the meanest streets in rome was overtaken by a thunderstorm and entered a low hostelry he called for wine and the rain continuing soon drank himself into a half stupid condition and dozed with his head on his hands and his hands upon the table in course of time the room began to fill and the noise of the rude guests to wake him then it was he became conscious of two figures near him conversing in a low voice one was a pardoner the other by his dress clean but modest might have passed for a decent tradesman but the way he had slouched his hat over his brows so as to hide all his face except his beard showed he was one of those who shun the eye of honest men and of the law the pair were driving a bargain in the sin market and by an arrangement not uncommon at that date the crime to be forgiven was yet to be committedunder the celestial contract he of the slouched hat was complaining of the price pardons had reached if they go up any higher we poor fellows shall be shut out of heaven altogether the pardoner denied the charge flatly indulgences were never cheaper to good husbandmen the other inquired who were they why such as sin by the market like reasonable creatures but if you will be so perverse as go and pick out a crime the pope hath set his face against blame yourself not me then to prove that crime of one sort or another was within the means of all but the very scum of society he read out the scale from a written parchment it was a curious list but not one that could be printed in this book and to mutilate it would be to misrepresent it it is to be found in any great library suffice it to say that murder of a layman was much cheaper than many crimes my lay readers would deem light by comparison this told and by a little trifling concession on each side the bargain was closed the money handed over and the aspirant to heavens favour forgiven beforehand for removing one layman the price for disposing of a clerk bore no proportion the word assassination was never once uttered by either merchant all this buzzed in gerards ear but he never lifted his head from the table only listened stupidly however when the parties rose and separated he half raised his head and eyed with a scowl the retiring figure of the purchaser if margaret was alive muttered he id take thee by the throat and throttle thee thou cowardly stabber but she is dead dead dead die all the world tis nought to me so that i die among the first when he got home there was a man in a slouched hat walking briskly to and fro on the opposite side of the way why there is that cur again thought gerard but in this state of mind the circumstance made no impression whatever on him chapter lxvi two nights after this pietro vanucci and andrea sat waiting supper for gerard the former grew peevish it was past nine oclock at last he sent andrea to gerards room on the desperate chance of his having come in unobserved andrea shrugged his shoulders and went he returned without gerard but with a slip of paper andrea could not read as scholars in his day and charity boys in ours understand the art but he had a quick eye and had learned how the words pietro vanucci looked on paper that is for you i trow said he proud of his intelligence pietro snatched it and read it to andrea with his satirical comments dear pietro dear andrea life is too great a burden so tis my lad but that is no reason for being abroad at suppertime supper is not a burden wear my habits said the poplar to the juniper bush and thou andrea mine amethyst ring and me in both your hearts a month or two why andrea for my body ere this ye read it will lie in tiber trouble not to look for it tis not worth the pains oh unhappy day that it was born oh happy night that rids me of it adieu adieu the brokenhearted gerard here is a sorry jest of the peevish rogue said pietro but his pale cheek and chattering teeth belied his words andrea filled the house with his cries o miserable day o calamity of calamities gerard my friend my sweet patron help help he is killing himself oh good people help me save him and after alarming all the house he ran into the street bareheaded imploring all good christians to help him save his friend a number of persons soon collected but poor andrea could not animate their sluggishness go down to the river no it was not their business what part of the river it was a wild goose chase it was not lucky to go down to the river after sunset too many ghosts walked those banks all night a lackey however who had been standing some time opposite the house said he would go with andrea and this turned three or four of the younger ones the little band took the way to the river the lackey questioned andrea andrea sobbing told him about the letter and gerards moody ways of late that lackey was a spy of the princess claelia their italian tongues went fast till they neared the tiber but the moment they felt the air from the river and the smell of the stream in the calm spring night they were dead silent the moon shone calm and clear in a cloudless sky their feet sounded loud and ominous their tongues were hushed presently hurrying round a corner they met a man he stopped irresolute at sight of them the man was bareheaded and his dripping hair glistened in the moonlight and at the next step they saw his clothes were drenched with water here he is cried one of the young men unacquainted with gerards face and figure the stranger turned instantly and fled they ran after him might and main andrea leading and the princesss lackey next andrea gained on him but in a moment he twisted up a narrow alley andrea shot by unable to check himself and the pursuers soon found themselves in a labyrinth in which it was vain to pursue a quickfooted fugitive who knew every inch of it and could now only be followed by the ear they returned to their companions and found them standing on the spot where the man had stood and utterly confounded for pietro had assured them that the fugitive had neither the features nor the stature of gerard are ye verily sure said they he had been in the river why in the saints names fled he at our approach then said vanucci friends methinks this has nought to do with him we seek what shall we do andrea here the lackey put in his word let us track him to the waters side to make sure see he hath come dripping all the way this advice was approved and with very little difficulty they tracked the mans course but soon they encountered a new enigma they had gone scarcely fifty yards ere the drops turned away from the river and took them to the gate of a large gloomy building it was a monastery they stood irresolute before it and gazed at the dark pile it seemed to them to hide some horrible mystery but presently andrea gave a shout here be the drops again cried he and this road leadeth to the river they resumed the chase and soon it became clear the drops were now leading them home the track became wetter and wetter and took them to the tibers edge and there on the bank a bucketful appeared to have been discharged from the stream at first they shouted and thought they had made a discovery but reflection showed them it amounted to nothing certainly a man had been in the water and had got out of it in safety but that man was not gerard one said he knew a fisherman hard by that had nets and drags they found the fisherman and paid him liberally to sink nets in the river below the place and to drag it above and below and promised him gold should he find the body then they ran vainly up and down the river which flowed so calm and voiceless holding this and a thousand more strange secrets suddenly andrea with a cry of hope ran back to the house he returned in less than half an hour no he groaned and wrung his hands what is the hour asked the lackey four hours past midnight my pretty lad said the lackey solemnly say a mass for thy friends soul for he is not among living men the morning broke worn out with fatigue andrea and pietro went home heart sick the days rolled on mute as the tiber as to gerards fate chapter lxvii it would indeed have been strange if with such barren data as they possessed those men could have read the handwriting on the rivers bank for there on that spot an event had just occurred which take it altogether was perhaps without a parallel in the history of mankind and may remain so to the end of time but it shall be told in a very few words partly by me partly by an actor in the scene gerard then after writing his brief adieu to pietro and andrea had stolen down to the river at nightfall he had taken his measures with a dogged resolution not uncommon in those who are bent on selfdestruction he filled his pockets with all the silver and copper he possessed that he might sink the surer and so provided hurried to a part of the stream that he had seen was little frequented there are some especially women who look about to make sure there is somebody at hand but this resolute wretch looked about him to make sure there was nobody and to his annoyance he observed a single figure leaning against the corner of an alley so he affected to stroll carelessly away but returned to the spot lo the same figure emerged from a side street and loitered about can he be watching me can he know what i am here for thought gerard impossible he went briskly off walked along a street or two made a detour and came back the man had vanished but lo on gerard looking all round to make sure there he was a few yards behind apparently fastening his shoe gerard saw he was watched and at this moment observed in the moonlight a steel gauntlet in his sentinels hand then he knew it was an assassin strange to say it never occurred to him that his was the life aimed at to be sure he was not aware he had an enemy in the world he turned and walked up to the bravo my good friend said he eagerly sell me thine arm a single stroke see here is all i have and he forced his money into the bravos hands oh prithee prithee do one good deed and rid me of my hateful life and even while speaking he undid his doublet and bared his bosom the man stared in his face why do ye hesitate shrieked gerard have ye no bowels is it so much pains to lift your arm and fall it is it because i am poor and cant give ye gold useless wretch canst only strike a man behind not look one in the face there then do but turn thy head and hold thy tongue and with a snarl of contempt he ran from him and flung himself into the water margaret at the heavy plunge of his body in the stream the bravo seemed to recover from a stupor he ran to the bank and with a strange cry the assassin plunged in after the selfdestroyer what followed will be related by the assassin chapter lxviii a woman has her own troubles as a man has his and we male writers seldom do more than indicate the griefs of the other sex the intelligence of the female reader must come to our aid and fill up our cold outlines so have i indicated rather than described what margaret brandt went through up to that eventful day when she entered elis house an enemy read her sweethearts letter and remained a friend and now a womans greatest trial drew near and gerard far away she availed herself but little of elis sudden favour for this reserve she had always a plausible reason ready and never hinted at the true one which was this there were two men in that house at sight of whom she shuddered with instinctive antipathy and dread she had read wickedness and hatred in their faces and mysterious signals of secret intelligence she preferred to receive catherine and her daughter at home the former went to see her every day and was wrapped up in the expected event catherine was one of those females whose office is to multiply and rear the multiplied who when at last they consent to leave off pelting one out of every room in the house with babies hover about the fair scourges that are still in full swing and do so cluck they seem to multiply by proxy it was in this spirit she entreated eli to let her stay at rotterdam while he went back to tergou the poor lass hath not a soul about her that knows anything about anything what avail a pair o soldiers why that sort o cattle should be putten out o doors the first at such an a time need i say that this was a great comfort to margaret poor soul she was full of anxiety as the time drew near she should die and gerard away but things balance themselves her poverty and her fathers helplessness which had cost her such a struggle stood her in good stead now adversitys iron hand had forced her to battle the lassitude that overpowers the rich of her sex and to be for ever on her feet working she kept this up to the last by catherines advice and so it was that one fine evening just at sunset she lay weak as water but safe with a little face by her side and the heaven of maternity opening on her why dost weep sweetheart all of a sudden he is not here to see it ah well lass he will be here ere tis weaned meantime god hath been as good to thee as to eer a woman born and do but bethink thee it might have been a girl didnt my very own kate threaten me with one and here we have got the bonniest boy in holland and a rare heavy one the saints be praised fort ay mother i am but a sorry ungrateful wretch to weep if only gerard were here to see it tis strange i bore him well enow to be away from me in my sorrow but oh it does seem so hard he should not share my joy prithee prithee come to me gerard dear dear gerard and she stretched out her feeble arms catherine hustled about but avoided margarets eyes for she could not restrain her own tears at hearing her own absent child thus earnestly addressed presently turning round she found margaret looking at her with a singular expression heard you nought no my lamb what i did cry on gerard but now ay ay sure i heard that well he answered me tush girl say not that mother as sure as i lie here with his boy by my side his voice came back to me margaret so yet methought twas not his happy voice but that might be the distance all voices go off sad like at a distance why art not happy sweetheart and i so happy this night mother i seem never to have felt a pain or known a care and her sweet eyes turned and gloated on the little face in silence that very night gerard flung himself into the tiber and that very hour she heard him speak her name he cried aloud in deaths jaws and despairs margaret account for it those who can i cannot chapter lxix in the guest chamber of a dominican convent lay a single stranger exhausted by successive and violent fits of nausea which had at last subsided leaving him almost as weak as margaret lay that night in holland a huge wood fire burned on the hearth and beside it hung the patients clothes a gigantic friar sat by his bedside reading pious collects aloud from his breviary the patient at times eyed him and seemed to listen at others closed his eyes and moaned the monk kneeled down with his face touching the ground and prayed for him then rose and bade him farewell day breaks said he i must prepare for matins good father jerome before you go how came i hither by the hand of heaven you flung away gods gift he bestowed it on you again think on it hast tried the world and found its gall now try the church the church is peace pax vobiscum he was gone gerard lay back meditating and wondering till weak and wearied he fell into a doze when he awoke again he found a new nurse seated beside him it was a layman with an eye as small and restless as friar jeromes was calm and majestic the man inquired earnestly how he felt very very weak where have i seen you before messer none the worse for my gauntlet inquired the other with considerable anxiety i was fain to strike you withal or both you and i should be at the bottom of tiber gerard stared at him what twas you saved me how well signor i was by the banks of tiber onon an errand no matter what you came to me and begged hard for a dagger stroke but ere i could oblige you ay even as you spoke to me i knew you for the signor that saved my wife and child upon the sea it is teresas husband and an assassin at your service well ser gerard the next thing was you flung yourself into tiber and bade me hold aloof i remember that had it been any but you believe me i had obeyed you and not wagged a finger men are my foes they may all hang on one rope or drown in one river for me but when thou sinking in tiber didst cry margaret ah my heart it cried teresa how could i go home and look her in the face did i let thee die and by the very death thou savedst her from so in i went and luckily for us both i swim like a duck you seeing me near and being bent on destruction tried to grip me and so end us both but i swam round thee and receive my excuses so buffeted thee on the nape of the neck with my steel glove that thou lost sense and i with much ado the stream being strong did draw thy body to land but insensible and full of water then i took thee on my back and made for my own home teresa will nurse him and be pleased with me thought i but hard by this monastery a holy friar the biggest eer i saw met us and asked the matter so i told him he looked hard at thee i know the face quoth he tis one gerard a fair youth from holland the same quo i then said his reverence he hath friends among our brethren leave him with us charity it is our office also he told me they of the convent had better means to tend thee than i had and that was true enow so i just bargained to be let in to see thee once a day and here thou art and the miscreant cast a strange look of affection and interest upon gerard gerard did not respond to it he felt as if a snake were in the room he closed his eyes ah thou wouldst sleep said the miscreant eagerly i go and he retired on tiptoe with a promise to come every day gerard lay with his eyes closed not asleep but deeply pondering saved from death by an assassin was not this the finger of heaven of that heaven he had insulted cursed and defied he shuddered at his blasphemies he tried to pray he found he could utter prayers but he could not pray i am doomed eternally he cried doomed doomed the organ of the convent church burst on his ear in rich and solemn harmony then rose the voices of the choir chanting a full service among them was one that seemed to hover above the others and tower towards heaven a sweet boys voice full pure angelic he closed his eyes and listened the days of his own boyhood flowed back upon him in those sweet pious harmonies no earthly dross there no foul fierce passions rending and corrupting the soul peace peace sweet balmy peace ay he sighed the church is peace of mind till i left her bosom i neer knew sorrow nor sin and the poor torn worn creature wept and even as he wept there beamed on him the sweet and reverend face of one he had never thought to see again it was the face of father anselm the good father had only reached the convent the night before last gerard recognized him in a moment and cried to him oh father anselm you cured my wounded body in juliers now cure my hurt soul in rome alas you cannot anselm sat down by the bedside and putting a gentle hand on his head first calmed him with a soothing word or two he then for he had learned how gerard came there spoke to him kindly but solemnly and made him feel his crime and urged him to repentance and gratitude to that divine power which had thwarted his will to save his soul come my son said he first purge thy bosom of its load ah father said gerard in juliers i could then i was innocent but now impious monster that i am i dare not confess to you why not my son thinkest thou i have not sinned against heaven in my time and deeply oh how deeply come poor laden soul pour forth thy grief pour forth thy faults hold back nought lie not oppressed and crushed by hidden sins and soon gerard was at father anselms knees confessing his every sin with sighs and groans of penitence thy sins are great said anselm thy temptation also was great terribly great i must consult our good prior the good anselm kissed his brow and left him to consult the superior as to his penance and lo gerard could pray now and he prayed with all his heart the phase through which this remarkable mind now passed may be summed in a wordpenitence he turned with terror and aversion from the world and begged passionately to remain in the convent to him convent nurtured it was like a bird returning wounded wearied to its gentle nest he passed his novitiate in prayer and mortification and pious reading and meditation the princess claelias spy went home and told her that gerard was certainly dead the manner of his death unknown at present she seemed literally stunned when after a long time she found breath to speak at all it was to bemoan her lot cursed with such ready tools so soon she sighed see how swift these monsters are to do ill deeds they come to us in our hot blood and first tempt us with their venal daggers then enact the mortal deeds we neer had thought on but for them ere many hours had passed her pity for gerard and hatred of his murderer had risen to fever heat which with this fool was blood heat poor soul i cannot call thee back to life but he shall never live that traitorously slew thee and she put armed men in ambush and kept them on guard all day ready when lodovico should come for his money to fall on him in a certain antechamber and hack him to pieces strike at his head said she for he weareth a privy coat of mail and if he goes hence alive your own heads shall answer it and so she sat weeping her victim and pulling the strings of machines to shed the blood of a second for having been her machine to kill the first chapter lxx one of the novice gerards selfimposed penances was to receive lodovico kindly feeling secretly as to a slimy serpent never was selfdenial better bestowed and like most rational penances it soon became no penance at all at first the pride and complacency with which the assassin gazed on the one life he had saved was perhaps as ludicrous as pathetic but it is a great thing to open a good door in a heart one good thing follows another through the aperture finding it so sweet to save life the miscreant went on to be averse to taking it and from that to remorse and from remorse to something very like penitence and here teresa cooperated by threatening not for the first time to leave him unless he would consent to lead an honest life the good fathers of the convent lent their aid and lodovico and teresa were sent by sea to leghorn where teresa had friends and the assassin settled down and became a porter he found it miserably dull work at first and said so but methinks this dull life of plodding labour was better for him than the brief excitement of being hewn in pieces by the princess claelias myrmidons his exile saved the unconscious penitent from that fate and the princess balked of her revenge took to brooding and fell into a profound melancholy dismissed her confessor and took a new one with a great reputation for piety to whom she confided what she called her griefs the new confessor was no other than fra jerome she could not have fallen into better hands he heard her grimly out then took her and shook the delusions out of her as roughly as if she had been a kitchenmaid for to do this hard monk justice on the path of duty he feared the anger of princes as little as he did the sea he showed her in a few words all thunder and lightning that she was the criminal of criminals thou art the devil that with thy money hath tempted one man to slay his fellow and then blinded with selflove instead of blaming and punishing thyself art thirsting for more blood of guilty men but not so guilty as thou at first she resisted and told him she was not used to be taken to task by her confessors but he overpowered her and so threatened her with the churchs curse here and hereafter and so tore the scales off her eyes and thundered at her and crushed her that she sank down and grovelled with remorse and terror at the feet of the gigantic boanerges oh holy father have pity on a poor weak woman and help me save my guilty soul i was benighted for want of ghostly counsel like thine good father i waken as from a dream doff thy jewels said fra jerome sternly i will i will doff thy silk and velvet and in humbler garb than wears thy meanest servant wend thou instant to loretto i will said the princess faintly no shoes but a bare sandal no father wash the feet of pilgrims both going and coming and to such of them as be holy friars tell thy sin and abide their admonition oh holy father let me wear my mask humph oh mercy bethink thee my features are known through italy ay beauty is a curse to most of ye well thou mayst mask thine eyes no more on this concession she seized his hand and was about to kiss it but he snatched it rudely from her what would ye do that hand handled the eucharist but an hour agone is it fit for such as thou to touch it ah no but oh go not without giving your penitent daughter your blessing time enow to ask it when you come back from loretto thus that marvellous occurrence by tibers banks left its mark on all the actors as prodigies are said to do the assassin softened by saving the life he was paid to take turned from the stiletto to the porters knot the princess went barefoot to loretto weeping her crime and washing the feet of baseborn men and gerard carried from the tiber into that convent a suicide now passed for a young saint within its walls loving but experienced eyes were on him upon a shorter probation than usual he was admitted to priests orders and soon after took the monastic vows and became a friar of st dominic dying to the world the monk parted with the very name by which he had lived in it and so broke the last link of association with earthly feelings here gerard ended and brother clement began chapter lxxi as is the race of leaves so is that of men and a great man budded unnoticed in a tailors house at rotterdam this year and a large man dropped to earth with great eclat philip duke of burgundy earl of holland etc etc lay sick at bruges now paupers got sick and got well as nature pleased but woe betided the rich in an age when for one mr malady killed three fell by dr remedy the dukes complaint nameless then is now diphtheria it is and was a very weakening malady and the duke was old so altogether dr remedy bled him the duke turned very cold wonderful then dr remedy had recourse to the arcana of science ho this is grave flay me an ape incontinent and clap him to the dukes breast officers of state ran septemvious seeking an ape to counteract the bloodthirsty tomfoolery of the human species perdition the duke was out of apes there were buffaloes lizards turks leopards any unreasonable beast but the right one why there used to be an ape about said one if i stand here i saw him so there used but the mastiff had mangled the sprightly creature for stealing his supper and so fulfilled the human precept soyez de votre siecle in this emergency the seneschal cast his despairing eyes around and not in vain a hopeful light shot into them here is this said he sotto voce surely this will serve tis altogether apelike doublet and hose apart nay said the chancellor peevishly the princess marie would hang us she doteth on this now this was our friend giles strutting all unconscious in cloth of gold then dr remedy grew impatient and bade flay a dog a dog is next best to an ape only it must be a dog all of one colour so they flayed a livercoloured dog and clapped it yet palpitating to their sovereigns breast and he died philip the good thus scientifically disposed of left thirtyone children of whom one somehow or another was legitimate and reigned in his stead the good duke provided for nineteen out of the other thirty the rest shifted for themselves according to the flemish chronicle the deceased prince was descended from the kings of troy through thierry of aquitaine and chilperic pharamond etc the old kings of franconia but this in reality was no distinction not a prince of his day have i been able to discover who did not come down from troy priam was mediaeval for adam the good dukes body was carried into burgundy and laid in a noble mausoleum of black marble at dijon holland rang with his death and little dreamed that anything as famous was born in her territory that year that judgment has been long reversed men gaze at the tailors house here the great birth of the fifteenth century took place in what house the good duke died no one knows and no one cares as the song says and why dukes philip the good come and go and leave mankind not a halfpenny wiser nor better nor other than they found it but when once in three hundred years such a child is born to the world as margarets son lo a human torch lighted by fire from heaven and fiat lux thunders from pole to pole chapter lxxii the cloister the dominicans or preaching friars once the most powerful order in europe were now on the wane their rivals and bitter enemies the franciscans were overpowering them throughout europe even in england a rich and religious country where under the name of the black friars they had once been paramount therefore the sagacious men who watched and directed the interests of the order were never so anxious to incorporate able and zealous sons and send them forth to win back the world the zeal and accomplishments of clement especially his rare mastery of language for he spoke latin italian french high and low dutch soon transpired and he was destined to travel and preach in england corresponding with the roman centre but jerome who had the superiors ear obstructed this design clement said he has the milk of the world still in his veins its feelings its weaknesses let not his newborn zeal and his humility tempt us to forego our ancient wisdom try him first and temper him lest one day we find ourselves leaning on a reed for a staff it is well advised said the prior take him in hand thyself then jerome following the ancient wisdom took clement and tried him one day he brought him to a field where the young men amused themselves at the games of the day he knew this to be a haunt of clements late friends and sure enough ere long pietro vanucci and andrea passed by them and cast a careless glance on the two friars they did not recognize their dead friend in a shaven monk clement gave a very little start and then lowered his eyes and said a paternoster would ye not speak with them brother said jerome trying him no brother yet was it good for me to see them they remind me of the sins i can never repent enough it is well said jerome and he made a cold report in clements favour then jerome took clement to many deathbeds and then into noisome dungeons places where the darkness was appalling and the stench loathsome pestilential and men looking like wild beasts lay coiled in rags and filth and despair it tried his body hard but the soul collected all its powers to comfort such poor wretches there as were not past comfort and clement shone in that trial jerome reported that clements spirit was willing but his flesh was weak good said anselm his flesh is weak but his spirit is willing but there was a greater trial in store i will describe it as it was seen by others one morning a principal street in rome was crowded and even the avenues blocked up with heads it was an execution no common crime had been done and on no vulgar victim the governor of rome had been found in his bed at daybreak slaughtered his hand raised probably in selfdefence lay by his side severed at the wrist his throat was cut and his temples bruised with some blunt instrument the murder had been traced to his servant and was to be expiated in kind this very morning italian executions were not cruel in general but this murder was thought to call for exact and bloody retribution the criminal was brought to the house of the murdered man and fastened for half an hour to its wall after this foretaste of legal vengeance his left hand was struck off like his victims a newkilled fowl was cut open and fastened round the bleeding stump with what view i really dont know but by the look of it some mares nest of the poor dear doctors and the murderer thus mutilated and bandaged was hurried to the scaffold and there a young friar was most earnest and affectionate in praying with him and for him and holding the crucifix close to his eyes presently the executioner pulled the friar roughly on one side and in a moment felled the culprit with a heavy mallet and falling on him cut his throat from ear to ear there was a cry of horror from the crowd the young friar swooned away a gigantic monk strode forward and carried him off like a child brother clement went back to the convent sadly discouraged he confessed to the prior with tears of regret courage son clement said the prior a dominican is not made in a day thou shalt have another trial and i forbid thee to go to it fasting clement bowed his head in token of obedience he had not long to wait a robber was brought to the scaffold a monster of villainy and cruelty who had killed men in pure wantonness after robbing them clement passed his last night in prison with him accompanied him to the scaffold and then prayed with him and for him so earnestly that the hardened ruffian shed tears and embraced him clement embraced him too though his flesh quivered with repugnance and held the crucifix earnestly before his eyes the man was garotted and clement lost sight of the crowd and prayed loud and earnestly while that dark spirit was passing from earth he was no sooner dead than the hangman raised his hatchet and quartered the body on the spot and oh mysterious heart of man the people who had seen the living body robbed of life with indifference almost with satisfaction uttered a piteous cry at each stroke of the axe upon his corpse that could feel nought clement too shuddered then but stood firm like one of those rocks that vibrate but cannot be thrown down but suddenly jeromes voice sounded in his ear brother clement get thee on that cart and preach to the people nay quickly strike with all thy force on all this iron while yet tis hot and souls are to be saved clements colour came and went and he breathed hard but he obeyed and with illassured step mounted the cart and preached his first sermon to the first crowd he had ever faced oh that sea of heads his throat seemed parched his heart thumped his voice trembled byandby the greatness of the occasion the sight of the eager upturned faces and his own heart full of zeal fired the pale monk he told them this robbers history warm from his own lips in the prison and showed his hearers by that example the gradations of folly and crime and warned them solemnly not to put foot on the first round of that fatal ladder and as alternately he thundered against the shedders of blood and moved the crowd to charity and pity his tremors left him and he felt all strung up like a lute and gifted with an unsuspected force he was master of that listening crowd could feel their very pulse could play sacred melodies on them as on his psaltery sobs and groans attested his power over the mob already excited by the tragedy before them jerome stared like one who goes to light a stick and fires a rocket after a while clement caught his look of astonishment and seeing no approbation in it broke suddenly off and joined him it was my first endeavour said he apologetically your behest came on me like a thunderbolt was idid ioh correct me and aid me with your experience brother jerome humph said jerome doubtfully he added rather sullenly after long reflection give the glory to god brother clement my opinion is thou art an orator born he reported the same at headquarters half reluctantly for he was an honest friar though a disagreeable one one julio antonelli was accused of sacrilege three witnesses swore they saw him come out of the church whence the candlesticks were stolen and at the very time other witnesses proved an alibi for him as positively neither testimony could be shaken in this doubt antonelli was permitted the trial by water hot or cold by the hot trial he must put his bare arm into boiling water fourteen inches deep and take out a pebble by the cold trial his body must be let down into eight feet of water the clergy who thought him innocent recommended the hot water trial which to those whom they favoured was not so terrible as it sounded but the poor wretch had not the nerve and chose the cold ordeal and this gave jerome another opportunity of steeling clement antonelli took the sacrament and then was stripped naked on the banks of the tiber and tied hand and foot to prevent those struggles by which a man throwing his arms out of the water sinks his body he was then let down gently into the stream and floated a moment with just his hair above water a simultaneous roar from the crowd on each bank proclaimed him guilty but the next moment the ropes which happened to be new got wet and he settled down another roar proclaimed his innocence they left him at the bottom of the river the appointed time rather more than half a minute then drew him up gurgling and gasping and screaming for mercy and after the appointed prayers dismissed him cleared of the charge during the experiment clement prayed earnestly on the bank when it was over he thanked god in a loud but slightly quavering voice byandby he asked jerome whether the man ought not to be compensated for what for the pain the dread the suffocation poor soul he liveth but hath tasted all the bitterness of death yet he had done no ill he is rewarded enough in that he is cleared of his fault but being innocent of that fault yet hath he drunk deaths cup though not to the dregs and his accusers less innocent than he do suffer nought jerome replied somewhat sternly it is not in this world men are really punished brother clement unhappy they who sin yet suffer not and happy they who suffer such ills as earth hath power to inflict tis counted to them above ay and a hundredfold clement bowed his head submissively may thy good words not fall to the ground but take root in my heart brother jerome but the severest trial clement underwent at jeromes hands was unpremeditated it came about thus jerome in an indulgent moment went with him to fra colonna and there the dream of polifilo lay on the table just copied fairly the poor author in the pride of his heart pointed out a masterstroke in it for ages said he fools have been lavishing poetic praise and amorous compliment on mortal women mere creatures of earth smacking palpably of their origin sirens at the windows where our roman women in particular have by lifelong study learned the wily art to show their one good feature though but an ear or an eyelash at a jalosy and hide all the rest magpies at the door capre n i giardini angeli in strada sante in chiesa diavoli in casa then come i and ransack the minstrels lines for amorous turns not forgetting those which petrarch wasted on that french jilt laura the sliest of them all and i lay you the whole bundle of spice at the feet of the only females worthy amorous incense to wit the nine muses by which goodly stratagem said jerome who had been turning the pages all this time you a friar of st dominic have produced an obscene book and he dashed polifilo on the table obscene thou discourteous monk and the author ran round the table snatched polifilo away locked him up and trembling with mortification said my gerard pshaw brother whatshisname had not found polifilo obscene puris omnia pura such as read your polifiloheaven grant they may be fewwill find him what i find him poor colonna gulped down this bitter pill as he might and had he not been in his own lodgings and a highborn gentleman as well as a scholar there might have been a vulgar quarrel as it was he made a great effort and turned the conversation to a beautiful chrysolite the cardinal colonna had lent him and while clement handled it enlarged on its moral virtues for he went the whole length of his age as a worshipper of jewels but jerome did not and expostulated with him for believing that one dead stone could confer valour on its wearer another chastity another safety from poison another temperance the experience of ages proves they do said colonna as to the last virtue you have named there sits a living proof this gerardi beg pardon brother thingemycomes from the north where men drink like fishes yet was he ever most abstemious and why carried an amethyst the clearest and fullest coloured eer i saw on any but noble finger where in heavens name is thine amethyst show it this unbeliever and twas that amethyst made the boy temperate asked jerome ironically certainly why what is the derivation and meaning of amethyst a negative and methua to tipple go to names are but the signs of things a stone is not called amethustos for two thousand years out of mere sport and abuse of language he then went through the prime jewels illustrating their moral properties especially of the ruby the sapphire the emerald and the opal by anecdotes out of grave historians these be old wives fables said jerome contemptuously was ever such credulity as thine now credulity is a reproach sceptics have often the illluck to incur but it mortifies them none the less for that the believer in stones writhed under it and dropped the subject then jerome mistaking his silence exhorted him to go a step farther and give up from this day his vain pagan lore and study the lives of the saints blot out these heathen superstitions from thy mind brother as christianity hath blotted them from the earth and in this strain he proceeded repeating incautiously some current but loose theological statements then the smarting polifilo revenged himself he flew out and hurled a mountain of crude miscellaneous lore upon jerome of which partly for want of time partly for lack of learning i can reproduce but a few fragments the heathen blotted out why they hold fourfifths of the world and what have we christians invented without their aid painting sculpture these are heathen arts and we but pigmies at them what modern mind can conceive and grave so godlike forms as did the chief athenian sculptors and the libyan licas and dinocrates of macedon and scopas timotheus leochares and briaxis chares lysippus and the immortal three of rhodes that wrought laocoon from a single block what prince hath the genius to turn mountains into statues as was done at bagistan and projected at athos what town the soul to plant a colossus of brass in the sea for the tallest ships to sail in and out between his legs is it architecture we have invented why here too we are but children can we match for pure design the parthenon with its clusters of double and single doric columns i do adore the doric when the scale is large and for grandeur and finish the theatres of greece and rome or the prodigious temples of egypt up to whose portals men walked awestruck through avenues a mile long of sphinxes each as big as a venetian palace and all these prodigies of porphyry cut and polished like crystal not rough hewn as in our puny structures even now their polished columns and pilasters lie oerthrown and broken oergrown with acanthus and myrtle but sparkling still and flouting the slovenly art of modern workmen is it sewers aqueducts viaducts why we have lost the art of making a roadlost it with the worlds greatest models under our very eye is it sepulchres of the dead why no christian nation has ever erected a tomb the sight of which does not set a scholar laughing do but think of the mausoleum and the pyramids and the monstrous sepulchres of the indus and ganges which outside are mountains and within are mines of precious stones ah you have not seen the east jerome or you could not decry the heathen jerome observed that these were mere material things true greatness was in the soul well then replied colonna in the world of mind what have we discovered is it geometry is it logic nay we are all pupils of euclid and aristotle is it written characters an invention almost divine we no more invented it than cadmus did is it poetry homer hath never been approached by us nor hath virgil nor horace is it tragedy or comedy why poets actors theatres all fell to dust at our touch have we succeeded in reviving them would you compare our little miserable mysteries and moralities all frigid personification and dog latin with the glories of a greek play on the decoration of which a hundred thousand crowns had been spent performed inside a marble miracle the audience a seated city and the poet a sophocles what then have we invented is it monotheism why the learned and philosophical among the greeks and romans held it even their more enlightened poets were monotheists in their sleeves zeus estin ouranos zeus te gy zeus toi panta saith the greek and lucan echoes him jupiter est quod cunque vides quo cunque moveris their vulgar were polytheists and what are ours we have not invented invocation of the saints our sancti answers to their daemones and divi and the heathen used to pray their divi or deified mortal to intercede with the higher divinity but the ruder minds among them incapable of nice distinctions worshipped those lesser gods they should have but invoked and so do the mob of christians in our day following the heathen vulgar or by unbroken tradition for in holy writ is no polytheism of any sort or kind we have not invented so much as a form or variety of polytheism the pagan vulgar worshipped all sorts of deified mortals and each had his favourite to whom he prayed ten times for once to the omnipotent our vulgar worship canonized mortals and each has his favourite to whom he prays ten times for once to god call you that invention invention is confined to the east among the ancient vulgar only the mariners were monotheists they worshipped venus called her stella maris and regina caelorum among our vulgar only the mariners are monotheists they worship the virgin mary and call her the star of the sea and the queen of heaven call you theirs a new religion an old doubtlet with a new button our vulgar make images and adore them which is absurd for adoration is the homage due from a creature to its creator now here man is the creator so the statues ought to worship him and would if they had brains enough to justify a rat in worshipping them but even this abuse though childish enough to be modern is ancient the pagan vulgar in these parts made their images then knelt before them adorned them with flowers offered incense to them lighted tapers before them carried them in procession and made pilgrimages to them just to the smallest tittle as we their imitators do jerome here broke in impatiently and reminded him that the images the most revered in christendom were made by no mortal hand but had dropped from heaven ay cried colonna such are the tutelary images of most great italian towns i have examined nineteen of them and made drafts of them if they came from the sky our worst sculptors are our angels but my mind is easy on that score ungainly statue or villainous daub fell never yet from heaven to smuggle the bread out of capable workmens mouths all this is pagan and arose thus the trojans had oriental imaginations and feigned that their palladium a wooden statue three cubits long fell down from heaven the greeks took this fib home among the spoils of troy and soon it rained statues on all the grecian cities and their latin apes and one of these palladia gave st paul trouble at ephesus twas a statue of diana that fell down from jupiter credat qui credere possit what would you cast your profane doubts on that picture of our blessed lady which scarce a century agone hung lustrous in the air over this very city and was taken down by the pope and bestowed in st peters church i have no profane doubts on the matter jerome this is the story of numas shield revived by theologians with an itch for fiction but no talent that way not being orientals the ancile or sacred shield of numa hung lustrous in the air over this very city till that pious prince took it down and hung it in the temple of jupiter be just swallow both stories or neither the bocca della verita passes for a statue of the virgin and convicted a woman of perjury the other day it is in reality an image of the goddess rhea and the modern figment is one of its ancient traditions swallow both or neither qui bavium non odit amet tua carmina mavi but indeed we owe all our palladiuncula and all our speaking nodding winking sweating bleeding statues to these poor abused heathens the athenian statues all sweated before the battle of chaeronea so did the roman statues during tullys consulship viz the statue of victory at capua of mars at rome and of apollo outside the gates the palladium itself was brought to italy by aeneas and after keeping quiet three centuries made an observation in vestas temple a trivial one i fear since it hath not survived junos statue at veii assented with a nod to go to rome antonys statue on mount alban bled from every vein in its marble before the fight of actium others cured diseases as that of pelichus derided by lucian for the wiser among the heathen believed in sweating marble weeping wood and bleeding brassas i do of all our marks and dents made in stone by soft substances this saints knee and that saints finger and tothers head the original is heathen thus the footprints of hercules were shown on a rock in scythia castor and pollux fighting on white horses for rome against the latians left the prints of their hoofs on a rock at regillum a temple was built to them on the spot and the marks were to be seen in tullys day you may see near venice a great stone cut nearly in half by st georges sword this he neer had done but for the old roman who cut the whetstone in two with his razor qui bavium non odit amet tua carmina mavi kissing of images and the popes toe is eastern paganism the egyptians had it of the assyrians the greeks of the egyptians the romans of the greeks and we of the romans whose pontifex maximus had his toe kissed under the empire the druids kissed the high priests toe a thousand years bc the mussulmans who like you profess to abhor heathenism kiss the stone of the caaba a pagan practice the priests of baal kissed their idols so tully tells us of a fair image of hercules at agrigentum whose chin was worn by kissing the lower parts of the statue we call peter are jupiter the toe is sore worn but not all by christian mouths the heathen vulgar laid their lips there first for many a year and ours have but followed them as monkeys their masters and that is why down with the poor heathen pereant qui ante nos nostra fecerint our infant baptism is persian with the font and the signing of the childs brow our throwing three handfuls of earth on the coffin and saying dust to dust is egyptian our incense is oriental roman pagan and the early fathers of the church regarded it with superstitious horror and died for refusing to handle it our holy water is pagan and all its uses see here is a pagan aspersorium could you tell it from one of ours it stood in the same part of their temples and was used in ordinary worship as ours and in extraordinary purifications they called it aqua lustralis their vulgar like ours thought drops of it falling on the body would wash out sin and their men of sense like ours smiled or sighed at such credulity what saith ovid of this folly which hath outlived him ah nimium faciles qui tristia crimina coedis fluminea tolli posse putetis aqua thou seest the heathen were not all fools no more are we not all fra colonna uttered all this with such volubility that his hearers could not edge in a word of remonstrance and not being interrupted in praising his favourites he recovered his good humour without any diminution of his volubility we celebrate the miraculous conception of the virgin on the nd of february the old romans celebrated the miraculous conception of juno on the nd of february our feast of all saints is on the nd november the festum dei mortis was on the nd november our candlemas is also an old roman feast neither the date nor the ceremony altered one tittle the patrician ladies carried candles about the city that night as our signoras do now at the gate of san croce our courtesans keep a feast on the th august ask them why the little noodles cannot tell you on that very spot stood the temple of venus her building is gone but her rite remains did we discover purgatory on the contrary all we really know about it is from two treatises of plato the gorgias and the phaedo and the sixth book of virgils aeneid i take it from a holier source st gregory said jerome sternly like enough replied colonna drily but st gregory was not so nice he took it from virgil some souls saith gregory are purged by fire others by water others by air says virgil aliae panduntur inanes suspensae ad ventous aliis sub gurgite vasto infectum eluitur scelus aut exuritur igni but peradventure you think pope gregory i lived before virgil and virgil versified him but the doctrine is eastern and as much older than plato as plato than gregory our prayers for the dead came from asia with aeneas ovid tells that when he prayed for the soul of anchises the custom was strange in italy hunc morem aeneas pietatis idoneus auctor attulit in terras juste latine tuas the biblicae sortes which i have seen consulted on the altar are a parody on the sortes virgilianae our numerous altars in one church are heathen the jews who are monotheists have but one altar in a church but the pagans had many being polytheists in the temple of pathian venus were a hundred of them centum que sabaeo thure calent arae our altars and our hundred lights around st peters tomb are pagan centum aras posuit vigilemque sacraverat ignem we invent nothing not even numerically our very devil is the god pan horns and hoofs and all but blackened for we cannot draw we can but daub the figures of antiquity with a little sorry paint or soot our moses hath stolen the horns of ammon our wolfgang the hook of saturn and janus bore the keys of heaven before st peter all our really old italian bronzes of the virgin and child are venuses and cupids so is the wooden statue that stands hard by this house of pope joan and the child she is said to have brought forth there in the middle of a procession idiots are newborn children thirteen years old and that boy is not a day younger cupid cupid cupid and since you accuse me of credulity know that to my mind that papess is full as mythological born of froth and every way unreal as the goddess who passes for her in the next street or as the saints you call st baccho and st quirina or st oracte which is a duncelike corruption of mount soracte or st amphibolus an english saint which is a duncelike corruption of the cloak worn by their st alban or as the spanish saint st viar which words on his tombstone written thus s viar prove him no saint but a good old nameless heathen and praefectus viarum or overseer of roads would he were back to earth and paganizing of our christian roads or as our st veronica of benasco which veronica is a duncelike corruption of the vera icon which this saint brought into the church i wish it may not be as unreal as the donor or as the eleven thousand virgins of cologne who were but a couple clement interrupted him to inquire what he meant i have spoken with those have seen their bones what of eleven thousand virgins all collected in one place and at one time do but bethink thee clement not one of the great eastern cities of antiquity could collect eleven thousand pagan virgins at one time far less a puny western city eleven thousand christian virgins in a little wee paynim city quod cunque ostendis mihi sic incredulus odi the simple sooth is this the martyrs were two the breton princess herself falsely called british and her maid onesimilla which is a greek name onesima diminished this some fool did mispronounce undecim mille eleven thousand loose tongue found credulous ears and so one fool made many eleven thousand of them an you will and you charge me with credulity jerome and bid me read the lives of the saints well i have read them and many a dear old pagan acquaintance i found there the best fictions in the book are oriental and are known to have been current in persia and arabia eight hundred years and more before the dates the church assigns to them as facts as for the true western figments they lack the oriental plausibility think you i am credulous enough to believe that st ida joined a decapitated head to its body that cuthberts carcass directed his bearers where to go and where to stop that a city was eaten up of rats to punish one hatto for comparing the poor to mice that angels have a little horn in their foreheads and that this was seen and recorded at the time by st veronica of benasco who never existed and hath left us this information and a miraculous handkercher for my part i think the holiest woman the world ere saw must have an existence ere she can have a handkercher or an eye to take unicorns for angels think you i believe that a brace of lions turned sextons and helped anthony bury paul of thebes that patrick a scotch saint stuck a goats beard on all the descendants of one that offended him that certain thieves having stolen the convent ram and denying it st pol de leon bade the ram bear witness and straight the mutton bleated in the thiefs belly would you have me give up the skilful figments of antiquity for such old wives fables as these the ancients lied about animals too but then they lied logically we unreasonably do but compare ephis and his lion or better still androcles and his lion with anthony and his two lions both the pagan lions do what lions never did but at the least they act in character a lion with a bone in his throat or a thorn in his foot could not do better than be civil to a man but anthonys lions are asses in a lions skin what leonine motive could they have in turning sextons a lions business is to make corpses not inter them he added with a sigh our lies are as inferior to the lies of the ancients as our statues and for the same reason we do not study nature as they did we are imitatores servum pecus believe you the lives of the saints that paul the theban was the first hermit and anthony the first caenobite why pythagoras was an eremite and under ground for seven years and his daughter was an abbess monks and hermits were in the east long before moses and neither old greece nor rome was ever without them as for st francis and his snowballs he did but mimic diogenes who naked embraced statues on which snow had fallen the folly without the poetry ape of an apefor diogenes was but a mimic therein of the brahmins and indian gymnosophists natheless the children of this francis bid fair to pelt us out of the church with their snowballs tell me now clement what habit is lovelier than the vestments of our priests well we owe them all to numa pompilius except the girdle and the stole which are judaical as for the amice and the albe they retain the very names they bore in numas day the pelt worn by the canons comes from primeval paganism tis a relic of those rude times when the sacrificing priest wore the skins of the beasts with the fur outward strip off thy black gown jerome thy girdle and cowl for they come to us all three from the pagan ladies let thy hair grow like absoloms jerome for the tonsure is as pagan as the muses take care what thou sayest said jerome sternly we know the very year in which the church did first ordain it but not invent it jerome the brahmins wore it a few thousands years ere that from them it came through the assyrians to the priests of isis in egypt and afterwards of serapis at athens the late pope the saints be good to him once told me the tonsure was forbidden by god to the levites in the pentateuch if so this was because of the egyptian priests wearing it i trust to his holiness i am no biblical scholar the latin of thy namesake jerome is a barrier i cannot overleap dixit ad me dominus dens dixi ad dominum deum no thank you holy jerome i can stand a good deal but i cannot stand thy latin nay give me the new testament tis not the greek of xenophon but tis greek and there be heathen sayings in it too for st paul was not so spiteful against them as thou when the heathen said a good thing that suited his matter by jupiter he just took it and mixed it to all eternity with the inspired text come forth clement come forth said jerome rising and thou profane monk know that but for the powerful house that upholds thee thy accursed heresy should go no farther for i would have thee burned at the stake and he strode out white with indignation colonnas reception of this threat did credit to him as an enthusiast he ran and hallooed joyfully after jerome and that is pagan burning of mens bodies for the opinions of their souls is a purely pagan customas pagan as incense holy water a hundred altars in one church the tonsure the cardinals or flamens hat the word pope the here jerome slammed the door but ere they could get clear of the house a jalosy was flung open and the paynim monk came out head and shoulders and overhung the street shouting affecti suppliciis chrisitiani genus hominum novas superstitionis ac maleficae and having delivered this parting blow he felt a great triumphant joy and strode exultant to and fro and not attending with his usual care to the fair way for his room could only be threaded by little paths wriggling among the antiquities tripped over the beak of an egyptian stork and rolled upon a regiment of armenian gods which he found tough in argument though small in stature you will go no more to that heretical monk said jerome to clement clement sighed shall we leave him and not try to correct him make allowance for heat of discourse he was nettled his words are worse than his acts oh tis a pure and charitable soul so are all archheretics satan does not tempt them like other men rather he makes them more moral to give their teaching weight fra colonna cannot be corrected his family is allpowerful in rome pray we the saints he blasphemes to enlighten him twill not be the first time they have returned good for evil meantime thou art forbidden to consort with him from this day go alone through the city confess and absolve sinners exorcise demons comfort the sick terrify the impenitent preach wherever men are gathered and occasion serves and hold no converse with the fra colonna clement bowed his head then the prior at jeromes request had the young friar watched and one day the spy returned with the news that brother clement had passed by the fra colonnas lodging and had stopped a little while in the street and then gone on but with his hand to his eyes and slowly this report jerome took to the prior the prior asked his opinion and also anselms who was then taking leave of him on his return to juliers jerome humph he obeyed but with regret ay with childish repining anselm he shed a natural tear at turning his back on a friend and a benefactor but he obeyed now anselm was one of your gentle irresistibles he had at times a mild ascendant even over jerome worthy brother anselm said jerome clement is weak to the very bone he will disappoint thee he will do nothing great either for the church or for our holy order yet he is an orator and hath drunken of the spirit of st dominic fly him then with a string that same day it was announced to clement that he was to go to england immediately with brother jerome clement folded his hands on his breast and bowed his head in calm submission chapter lxxiii the hearth a catherine is not an unmixed good in a strange house the governing power is strong in her she has scarce crossed the threshold ere the utensils seem to brighten the hearth to sweep itself the windows to let in more light and the soul of an enormous cricket to animate the dwellingplace but this cricket is a busy body and that is a tremendous character it has no discrimination it sets everything to rights and everybody now many things are the better for being set to rights but everything is not everything is the one thing that wont stand being set to rights except in that calm and cool retreat the grave catherine altered the position of every chair and table in margarets house and perhaps for the better but she must go farther and upset the live furniture when margarets time was close at hand catherine treacherously invited the aid of denys and martin and on the poor simpleminded fellows asking her earnestly what service they could be she told them they might make themselves comparatively useful by going for a little walk so far so good but she intimated further that should the promenade extend into the middle of next week all the better this was not ingratiating the subsequent conduct of the strong under the yoke of the weak might have propitiated a shebear with three cubs one sickly they generally slipped out of the house at daybreak and stole in like thieves at night and if by any chance they were at home they went about like cats on a wall tipped with broken glass and wearing awestruck visages and a general air of subjugation and depression but all would not do their very presence was illtimed and jarred upon catherines nerves did instinct whisper a pair of depopulators had no business in a house with multipliers twain the breastplate is no armour against a female tongue and catherine ran infinite pins and needles of speech into them in a word when margaret came down stairs she found the kitchen swept of heroes martin old and stiff had retreated no farther than the street and with the honours of war for he had carried off his baggage a stool and sat on it in the air margaret saw he was out in the sun but was not aware he was a fixture in that luminary she asked for denys good kind denys he will be right pleased to see me about again catherine wiping a bowl with now superfluous vigour told her denys was gone to his friends in burgundy and high time hasnt been anigh them this three years by all accounts what gone without bidding me farewell said margaret uplifting two tender eyes like fullblown violets catherine reddened for this new view of the matter set her conscience pricking her but she gave a little toss and said oh you were asleep at the time and i would not have you wakened poor denys said margaret and the dew gathered visibly on the open violets catherine saw out of the corner of her eye and without taking a bit of open notice slipped off and lavished hospitality and tenderness on the surviving depopulator it was sudden and martin old and stiff in more ways than one no thank you dame i have got used to out o doors and i love not changing and changing i meddle wi nobody here and nobody meddles wi me oh you nasty cross old wretch screamed catherine passing in a moment from treacle to sharpest vinegar and she flounced back into the house on calm reflection she had a little cry then she half reconciled herself to her conduct by vowing to be so kind margaret should never miss her plagues of soldiers but feeling still a little uneasy she dispersed all regrets by a process at once simple and sovereign she took and washed the child from head to foot she washed him in tepid water and heroes and their wrongs became as dust in an oceanof soap and water while this celestial ceremony proceeded margaret could not keep quiet she hovered round the fortunate performer she must have an apparent hand in it if not a real she put her finger into the waterto pave the way for her boy i suppose for she could not have deceived herself so far as to think catherine would allow her to settle the temperature during the ablution she kneeled down opposite the little gerard and prattled to him with amazing fluency taking care however not to articulate like grownup people for how could a cherub understand their ridiculous pronunciation i wish you could wash out that said she fixing her eyes on the little boys hand what what have you not noticed on his little finger granny looked and there was a little brown mole eh but this is wonderful she cried nature my lass yare strong and meddlesome to boot hast noticed such a mark on some one else tell the truth girl what on him nay mother not i well then he has and on the very spot and you never noticed that much but dear heart i forgot you hant known him from child to man as i have i have had him hundreds o times on my knees the same as this and washed him from top to toe in lukewarm water and she swelled with conscious superiority and margaret looked meekly up to her as a woman beyond competition catherine looked down from her dizzy height and moralized she differed from other busybodies in this that she now and then reflected not deeply or of course i should take care not to print it it is strange said she how things come round and about life is but a whirligig leastways we poor women our lives are all cut upon one pattern wasnt i for washing out my gerards mole in his young days oh fie heres a foul blot quo i and scrubbed away at it i did till i made the poor wight cry so then i thought twas time to give over and now says you to me mother says you do try and wash you out o my gerards finger says you think ont wash it out cried margaret i wouldnt for all the world why it is the sweetest bit in his little darling body ill kiss it morn and night till he that owned it first comes back to us three oh bless you my jewel of gold and silver for being marked like your own daddy to comfort me and she kissed little gerards little mole but she could not stop there she presently had him sprawling on her lap and kissed his back all over again and again and seemed to worry him as wolf a lamb catherine looking on and smiling she had seen a good many of these savage onslaughts in her day and this little sketch indicates the tenor of margarets life for several months one or two small things occurred to her during that time which must be told but i reserve them since one string will serve for many glass beads but while her boys father was passing through those fearful tempests of the soul ending in the dead monastic calm her life might fairly be summed in one great blissful wordmaternity you who know what lies in that word enlarge my little sketch and see the young mother nursing and washing and dressing and undressing and crowing and gambolling with her firstborn then swifter than lightning dart your eye into italy and see the cold cloister and the monks passing like ghosts eyes down hands meekly crossed over bosoms dead to earthly feelings one of these cowled ghosts is he whose return full of love and youth and joy that radiant young mother awaits in the valley of grindelwald the traveller has on one side the perpendicular alps all rock ice and everlasting snow towering above the clouds and piercing to the sky on his other hand little everyday slopes but green as emeralds and studded with cows and pretty cots and life whereas those lofty neighbours stand leafless lifeless inhuman sublime elsewhere sweet commonplaces of nature are apt to pass unnoticed but fronting the grim alps they soothe and even gently strike the mind by contrast with their tremendous opposites such in their way are the two halves of this story rightly looked at on the italian side rugged adventure strong passion blasphemy vice penitence pure ice holy snow soaring direct at heaven on the dutch side all on a humble scale and womanish but ever green and as a pathway parts the ice towers of grindelwald aspiring to the sky from its little sunny braes so here is but a page between the cloister and the hearth chapter lxxiv the cloister the new pope favoured the dominican order the convent received a message from the vatican requiring a capable friar to teach at the university of basle now clement was the very monk for this well versed in languages and in his worldly days had attended the lectures of guarini the younger his visit to england was therefore postponed though not resigned and meantime he was sent to basle but not being wanted there for three months he was to preach on the road he passed out of the northern gate with his eyes lowered and the whole man wrapped in pious contemplation oh if we could paint a mind and its story what a walking fresco was this barefooted friar hopeful happy love bereavement despair impiety vice suicide remorse religious despondency penitence death to the world resignation and all in twelve short months and now the traveller was on foot again but all was changed no perilous adventures now the very thieves and robbers bowed to the ground before him and instead of robbing him forced stolen money on him and begged his prayers this journey therefore furnished few picturesque incidents i have however some readers to think of who care little for melodrama and expect a quiet peep at what passes inside a man to such students things undramatic are often vocal denoting the progress of a mind the first sunday of clements journey was marked by this he prayed for the soul of margaret he had never done so before not that her eternal welfare was not dearer to him than anything on earth it was his humility the terrible impieties that burst from him on the news of her death horrified my welldisposed readers but not as on reflection they horrified him who had uttered them for a long time during his novitiate he was oppressed with religious despair he thought he must have committed that sin against the holy spirit which dooms the soul for ever by degrees that dark cloud cleared away anselmo juvante but deep selfabasement remained he felt his own salvation insecure and moreover thought it would be mocking heaven should he the deeply stained pray for a soul so innocent comparatively as margarets so he used to coax good anselm and another kindly monk to pray for her they did not refuse nor do it by halves in general the good old monks and there were good bad and indifferent in every convent had a pure and tender affection for their younger brethren which in truth was not of this world clement then having preached on sunday morning in a small italian town and being mightily carried onward was greatly encouraged and that day a balmy sense of gods forgiveness and love descended on him and he prayed for the welfare of margarets soul and from that hour this became his daily habit and the one purified tie that by memory connected his heart with earth for his family were to him as if they had never been the church would not share with earth nor could even the church cure the great love without annihilating the smaller ones during most of this journey clement rarely felt any spring of life within him but when he was in the pulpit the other exceptions were when he happened to relieve some fellowcreature a young man was tarantula bitten or perhaps like many more fancied it fancy or reality he had been for two days without sleep and in most extraordinary convulsions leaping twisting and beating the walls the village musicians had only excited him worse with their music exhaustion and death followed the disease when it gained such a head clement passed by and learned what was the matter he sent for a psaltery and tried the patient with soothing melodies but if the other tunes maddened him clements seemed to crush him he groaned and moaned under them and grovelled on the floor at last the friar observed that at intervals his lips kept going he applied his ear and found the patient was whispering a tune and a very singular one that had no existence he learned this tune and played it the patients face brightened amazingly he marched about the room on the light fantastic toe enjoying it and when clements fingers ached nearly off with playing it he had the satisfaction of seeing the young man sink complacently to sleep to this lullaby the strange creation of his own mind for it seems he was no musician and never composed a tune before or after this sleep saved his life and clement after teaching the tune to another in case it should be wanted again went forward with his heart a little warmer on another occasion he found a mob haling a decently dressed man along who struggled and vociferated but in a strange language this person had walked into their town erect and sprightly waving a mulberry branch over his head thereupon the natives first gazed stupidly not believing their eyes then pounced on him and dragged him before the podesta clement went with them but on the way drew quietly near the prisoner and spoke to him in italian no answer in french german dutch no assets then the man tried clement in tolerable latin but with a sharpish accent he said he was an englishman and oppressed with the heat of italy had taken a bough off the nearest tree to save his head in my country anybody is welcome to what grows on the highway confound the fools i am ready to pay for it but here is all italy up in arms about a twig and a handful of leaves the pigheaded podesta would have sent the dogged islander to prison but clement mediated and with some difficulty made the prisoner comprehend that silkworms and by consequence mulberry leaves were sacred being under the wing of the sovereign and his source of income and urged on the podesta that ignorance of his mulberry laws was natural in a distant country where the very tree perhaps was unknown the opinionative islander turned the still vibrating scale by pulling out a long purse and repeating his original theory that the whole question was mercantile quid damni said he dic et cito solvam the podesta snuffed the gold fined him a ducat for the duke about the value of the whole tree and pouched the coin the englishman shook off his ire the moment he was liberated and laughed heartily at the whole thing but was very grateful to clement you are too good for this hole of a country father said he come to england that is the only place in the world i was an uneasy fool to leave it and wander among mulberries and their idiots i am a kentish squire and educated at cambridge university my name it is rolfe my place betshanger the man and the house are both at your service come over and stay till domesday we sit down forty to dinner every day at betshanger one more or one less at the board will not be seen you shall end your days with me and my heirs if you will come now what an englishman says he means and he gave him a great hearty grip of the hand to confirm it i will visit thee some day my son said clement but not to weary thy hospitality the englishman then begged clement to shrive him i know not what will become of my soul said he i live like a heathen since i left england clement consented gladly and soon the islander was on his knees to him by the roadside confessing the last months sins finding him so pious a son of the church clement let him know he was really coming to england he then asked him whether it was true that country was overrun with lollards and wickliffites the other coloured up a little there be black sheep in every land said he then after some reflection he said gravely holy father hear the truth about these heretics none are better disposed towards holy church than we english but we are ourselves and by ourselves we love our own ways and above all our own tongue the norman could conquer our billhooks but not our tongues and hard they tried it for many a long year by law and proclamation our good foreign priests utter god to plain english folk in latin or in some french or italian lingo like the bleating of a sheep then come the fox wickliff and his crew and read him out of his own book in plain english that all mens hearts warm to who can withstand this god forgive me i believe the english would turn deaf ears to st peter himself spoke he not to them in the tongue their mothers sowed in their ears and their hearts along with mothers kisses he added hastily i say not this for myself i am cambridge bred and good words come not amiss to me in latin but for the people in general clavis ad corda anglorum est lingua materna my son said clement blessed be the hour i met thee for thy words are sober and wise but alas how shall i learn your english tongue no book have i i would give you my book of hours father tis in english and latin cheek by jowl but then what would become of my poor soul wanting my hours in a strange land stay you are a holy man and i am an honest one let us make a bargain you to pray for me every day for two months and i to give you my book of hours here it is what say you to that and his eyes sparkled and he was all on fire with mercantility clement smiled gently at this trait and quietly detached a ms from his girdle and showed him that it was in latin and italian see my son said he heaven hath foreseen our several needs and given us the means to satisfy them let us change books and my dear son i will give thee my poor prayers and welcome not sell them thee i love not religious bargains the islander was delighted so shall i learn the italian tongue without risk to my eternal weal near is my purse but nearer is my soul he forced money on clement in vain the friar told him it was contrary to his vow to carry more of that than was barely necessary lay it out for the good of the church and of my soul said the islander i ask you not to keep it but take it you must and shall and he grasped clements hand warmly again and clement kissed him on the brow and blessed him and they went each his way about a mile from where they parted clement found two tired wayfarers lying in the deep shade of a great chestnuttree one of a thick grove the road skirted near the men was a little cart and in it a printingpress rude and clumsy as a vinepress a jaded mule was harnessed to the cart and so clement stood face to face with his old enemy and as he eyed it and the honest blueeyed faces of the wearied craftsmen he looked back as on a dream at the bitterness he had once felt towards this machine he looked kindly down on them and said softly sweynheim the men started to their feet pannartz they scuttled into the wood and were seen no more clement was amazed and stood puzzling himself presently a face peeped from behind a tree clement addressed it what fear ye a quavering voice replied say rather by what magic you a stranger can call us by our names i never clapt eyes on you till now o superstition i know ye as all good workmen are knownby your works come hither and i will tell ye they advanced gingerly from different sides each regulating his advance by the others my children said clement i saw a lactantius in rome printed by sweynheim and pannartz disciples of fust dye hear that pannartz our work has gotten to rome already by your blue eyes and flaxen hair i wist ye were germans and the printingpress spoke for itself who then should ye be but fusts disciples pannartz and sweynheim the honest germans were now astonished that they had suspected magic in so simple a matter the good father hath his wits about him that is all said pannartz ay said sweynheim and with those wits would he could tell us how to get this tired beast to the next town yea said sweynheim and where to find money to pay for his meat and ours when we get there i will try said clement free the mule of the cart and of all harness but the bare halter this was done and the animal immediately lay down and rolled on his back in the dust like a kitten whilst he was thus employed clement assured them he would rise up a new mule his creator hath taught him this art to refresh himself which the nobler horse knoweth not now with regard to money know that a worthy englishman hath entrusted me with a certain sum to bestow in charity to whom can i better give a strangers money than to strangers take it then and be kind to some englishman or other stranger in his need and may all nations learn to love one another one day the tears stood in the honest workmens eyes they took the money with heartfelt thanks it is your nation we are bound to thank and bless good father if we but knew it my nation is the church clement was then for bidding them farewell but the honest fellows implored him to wait a little they had no silver nor gold but they had something they could give their benefactor they took the press out of the cart and while clement fed the mule they hustled about now on the white hot road now in the deep cool shade now half in and half out and presently printed a quarto sheet of eight pages which was already set up they had not type enough to print two sheets at a time when after the slower preliminaries the printed sheet was pulled all in a moment clement was amazed in turn what are all these words really fast upon the paper said he is it verily certain they will not go as swiftly as they came and you took me for a magician tis augustine de civitate dei my sons you carry here the very wings of knowledge oh never abuse this great craft print no ill books they would fly abroad countless as locusts and lay waste mens souls the workmen said they would sooner put their hands under the screw than so abuse their goodly craft and so they parted there is nothing but meeting and parting in this world at a town in tuscany the holy friar had a sudden and strange recontre with the past he fell in with one of those motley assemblages of patricians and plebeians piety and profligacy a company of pilgrims a subject too well painted by others for me to go and daub they were in an immense barn belonging to the inn clement dusty and wearied and no lover of idle gossip sat in a corner studying the englishmans hours and making them out as much by his own dutch as by the latin version presently a servant brought a bucket half full of water and put it down at his feet a female servant followed with two towels and then a woman came forward and crossing herself kneeled down without a word at the bucketside removed her sleeves entirely and motioned to him to put his feet into the water it was some lady of rank doing penance she wore a mask scarce an inch broad but effectual moreover she handled the friars feet more delicately than those do who are born to such offices these penances were not uncommon and clement though he had little faith in this form of contrition received the services of the incognita as a matter of course but presently she sighed deeply and with her heartfelt sigh and her head bent low over her menial office she seemed so bowed with penitence that he pitied her and said calmly but gently can i aught for your souls weal my daughter she shook her head with a faint sob nought holy father nought only to hear the sin of her who is most unworthy to touch thy holy feet tis part of my penance to tell sinless men how vile i am speak my daughter father said the lady bending lower and lower these hands of mine look white but they are stained with bloodthe blood of the man i loved alas you withdraw your foot ah me what shall i do all holy things shrink from me culpa mea culpa mea said clement eagerly my daughter it was an unworthy movement of earthly weakness for which i shall do penance judge not the church by her feebler servants not her foot but her bosom is offered to thee repenting truly take courage then and purge thy conscience of its load on this the lady in a trembling whisper and hurriedly and cringing a little as if she feared the church would strike her bodily for what she had done made this confession he was a stranger and baseborn but beautiful as spring and wise beyond his years i loved him i had not the prudence to conceal my love nobles courted me i neer thought one of humble birth could reject me i showed him my heart oh shame of my sex he drew back yet he admired me but innocently he loved another and he was constant i resorted to a womans wiles they availed not i borrowed the wickedness of men and threatened his life and to tell his true lover he died false to her ah you shrink your foot trembles am i not a monster then he wept and prayed to me for mercy then my good angel helped me i bade him leave rome gerard gerard why did you not obey me i thought he was gone but two months after this i met him never shall i forget it i was descending the tiber in my galley when he came up it with a gay company and at his side a woman beautiful as an angel but bold and bad that woman claimed me aloud for her rival traitor and hypocrite he had exposed me to her and to all the loose tongues in rome in terror and revenge i hireda bravo when he was gone on his bloody errand i wavered too late the dagger i had hired struck he never came back to his lodgings he was dead alas perhaps he was not so much to blame none have ever cast his name in my teeth his poor body is not found or i should kiss its wounds and slay myself upon it all around his very name seems silent as the grave to which this murderous hand hath sent him clements eye was drawn by her movement he recognized her shapely arm and soft white hand and oh he was so young to die a poor thoughtless boy that had fallen a victim to that bad womans arts and she had made him tell her everything monster of cruelty what penance can avail me oh holy father what shall i do clements lips moved in prayer but he was silent he could not see his duty clear then she took his feet and began to dry them she rested his foot upon her soft arm and pressed it with the towel so gently she seemed incapable of hurting a fly yet her lips had just told another story and a true one while clement was still praying for wisdom a tear fell upon his foot it decided him my daughter said he i myself have been a great sinner you father i quite as great a sinner as thou though not in the same way the devil has gins and snares as well as traps but penitence softened my impious heart and then gratitude remoulded it therefore seeing you penitent i hope you can be grateful to him who has been more merciful to you than you have to your fellowcreature daughter the church sends you comfort comfort to me ah never unless it can raise my victim from the dead take this crucifix in thy hand fix thine eyes on it and listen to me was all the reply yes father but let me thoroughly dry your feet first tis ill sitting in wet feet and you are the holiest man of all whose feet i have washed i know it by your voice woman i am not as for my feet they can wait their turn obey thou me yes father said the lady humbly but with a womans evasive pertinacity she wreathed one towel swiftly round the foot she was drying and placed his other foot on the dry napkin then obeyed his command and as she bowed over the crucifix the low solemn tones of the friar fell upon her ear and his words soon made her whole body quiver with various emotion in quick succession my daughter he you murderedin intentwas one gerard a hollander he loved a creature as men should love none but their redeemer and his church heaven chastised him a letter came to rome she was dead poor gerard poor margaret moaned the penitent clements voice faltered at this a moment but soon by a strong effort he recovered all his calmness his feeble nature yielded body and soul to the blow he was stricken down with fever he revived only to rebel against heaven he said there is no god poor poor gerard poor gerard thou feeble foolish woman nay wicked impious gerard he plunged into vice and soiled his eternal jewel those you met him with were his daily companions but know rash creature that the seeming woman you took to be his leman was but a boy dressed in womans habits to flout the others a fair boy called andrea what that andrea said to thee i know not but be sure neither he nor any layman knows thy folly this gerard rebel against heaven was no traitor to thee unworthy the lady moaned like one in bodily agony and the crucifix began to tremble in her trembling hands courage said clement comfort is at hand from crime he fell into despair and bent on destroying his soul he stood one night by tiber resolved on suicide he saw one watching him it was a bravo holy saints he begged the bravo to despatch him he offered him all his money to slay him body and soul the bravo would not then this desperate sinner not softened even by that refusal flung himself into tiber ah and the assassin saved his life thou hadst chosen for the task lodovico husband of teresa whom this gerard had saved at sea her and her infant child he lives he lives he lives i am faint the friar took the crucifix from her hands fearing it might fall a shower of tears relieved her the friar gave her time then continued calmly ay he lives thanks to thee and thy wickedness guided to his eternal good by an almighty and allmerciful hand thou art his greatest earthly benefactor where is he where where what is that to thee only to see him alive to beg him on my knees forgive me i swear to you i will never presume again tohow could i he knows all oh shame father does he know all then never will i meet his eye i should sink into the earth but i would repair my crime i would watch his life unseen he shall rise in the world whence i so nearly thrust him poor soul the caesare my family are allpowerful in rome and i am near their head my daughter said clement coldly he you call gerard needs nothing man can do for him saved by a miracle from double death he has left the world and taken refuge from sin and folly in the bosom of the church a priest a priest and a friar a friar then you are not his confessor yet you know all that gentle voice she raised her head slowly and peered at him through her mask the next moment she uttered a faint shriek and lay with her brow upon his bare feet chapter lxxv clement sighed he began to doubt whether he had taken the wisest course with a creature so passionate but young as he was he had already learned many lessons of ecclesiastical wisdom for one thing he had been taught to pause ie in certain difficulties neither to do nor to say anything until the matter should clear itself a little he therefore held his peace and prayed for wisdom all he did was gently to withdraw his foot but his penitent flung her arms round it with a piteous cry and held it convulsively and wept over it and now the agony of shame as well as penitence she was in showed itself by the bright red that crept over her very throat as she lay quivering at his feet my daughter said clement gently take courage torment thyself no more about this gerard who is not as for me i am brother clement whom heaven hath sent to thee this day to comfort thee and help thee save thy soul thou last made me thy confessor i claim then thine obedience oh yes sobbed the penitent leave this pilgrimage and instant return to rome penitence abroad is little worth there where we live lie the temptations we must defeat or perish not fly in search of others more showy but less lethal easy to wash the feet of strangers masked ourselves hard to be merely meek and charitable with those about us ill never never lay finger on her again nay i speak not of servants only but of dependents kinsmen friends this be thy penance the last thing at night and the first thing after matins call to mind thy sin and god his goodness and so be humble and gentle to the faults of those around thee the world it courts the rich but seek thou the poor not beggars these for the most are neither honest nor truly poor but rather find out those who blush to seek thee yet need thee sore giving to them shalt lend to heaven marry a good son of the church me i will never marry thou wilt marry within the year i do entreat and command thee to marry one that feareth god for thou art very clay mated ill thou shalt be naught but wedding a worthy husband thou mayest dei gratia live a pious princess ay and die a saint i thou he then desired her to rise and go about the good work he had set her she rose to her knees and removing her mask cast an eloquent look upon him then lowered her eyes meekly i will obey you as i would an angel how happy i am yet unhappy for oh my heart tells me i shall never look on you again i will not go till i have dried your feet it needs not i have excused thee this bootless penance tis no penance to me ah you do not forgive me if you will not let me dry your poor feet so be it then said clement resignedly and thought to himself levius quid foemina but these weak creatures that gravitate towards the small as heavenly bodies towards the great have yet their own flashes of angelic intelligence when the princess had dried the friars feet she looked at him with tears in her beautiful eyes and murmured with singular tenderness and goodness i will have masses said for her soul may i she added timidly this brought a faint blush into the monks cheek and moistened his cold blue eye it came so suddenly from one he was just rating so low it is a gracious thought he said do as thou wilt often such acts fall back on the doer like blessed dew i am thy confessor not hers thine is the soul i must now do my all to save or woe be to my own my daughter my dear daughter i see good and ill angels fighting for thy soul this day ay this moment oh fight thou on thine own side dost thou remember all i bade thee remember said the princess sweet saint each syllable of thine is graved in my heart but one word more then pray much to christ and little to his saints i will and that is the best word i have light to say to thee so part we on it thou to the place becomes thee best thy fathers house i to my holy mothers work adieu faltered the princess adieu thou that i have loved too well hated too ill known and revered too late forgiving angel adieufor ever the monk caught her words though but faltered in a sigh for ever he cried aloud with sudden ardour christians live for ever and love for ever but they never part for ever they part as part the earth and sun to meet more brightly in a little while you and i part here for life and what is our life one line in the great story of the church whose son and daughter we are one handful in the sand of time one drop in the ocean of for ever adieufor the little moment called a life we part in trouble we shall meet in peace we part creatures of clay we shall meet immortal spirits we part in a world of sin and sorrow we shall meet where all is purity and love divine where no ill passions are but christ is and his saints around him clad in white there in the turning of an hourglass in the breaking of a bubble in the passing of a cloud she and thou and i shall meet again and sit at the feet of angels and archangels apostles and saints and beam like them with joy unspeakable in the light of the shadow of god upon his throne for everand everand ever and so they parted the monk erect his eyes turned heavenwards and glowing with the sacred fire of zeal the princess slowly retiring and turning more than once to cast a lingering glance of awe and tender regret on that inspired figure she went home subdued and purified clement in due course reached basle and entered on his duties teaching in the university and preaching in the town and neighbourhood he led a life that can be comprised in two words deep study and mortification my reader has already a peep into his soul at basle he advanced in holy zeal and knowledge the brethren of his order began to see in him a descendant of the saints and martyrs chapter lxxvi the hearth when little gerard was nearly three months old a messenger came hot from tergou for catherine now just you go back said she and tell them i cant come and i wont they have got kate so he departed and catherine continued her sentence there child i must go they are all at sixes and sevens this is the third time of asking and tomorrow my man would come himself and take me home by the ear with a flea int she then recapitulated her experiences of infants and instructed margaret what to do in each coming emergency and pressed money upon her margaret declined it with thanks catherine insisted and turned angry margaret made excuses all so reasonable that catherine rejected them with calm contempt to her mind they lacked femininity come out with your heart said she and you and me parting and mayhap shall never see one anothers face again oh mother say not so alack girl i have seen it so often twill come into my mind now at each parting when i was your age i never had such a thought nay we were all to live for ever then so out wi it well then motheri would rather not have told youyour cornelis must say to me so you are come to share with us eh mistress those were his words i told him i would be very sorry beshrew his ill tongue what signifies it he will never know most likely he would sooner or later but whether or no i will take no grudged bounty from any family unless i saw my child starving andheaven only knows what i might do nay mother give me but thy lovei do prize that above silver and they grudge me not that by all i can findfor not a stiver of money will i take out of your house you are a foolish lass why were it me id take it just to spite him no you would not you and i are apples off one tree catherine yielded with a good grace and when the actual parting came embraces and tears burst forth on both sides when she was gone the child cried a good deal and all attempts to pacify him failing margaret suspected a pin and searching between his clothes and his skin found a gold angel incommoding his backbone there now gerard said she to the babe i thought granny gave in rather sudden she took the coin and wrapped it in a piece of linen and laid it at the bottom of her box bidding the infant observe she could be at times as resolute as granny herself catherine told eli of margarets foolish pride and how she had baffled it eli said margaret was right and she was wrong catherine tossed her head eli pondered margaret was not without domestic anxieties she had still two men to feed and could not work so hard as she had done she had enough to do to keep the house and the child and cook for them all but she had a little money laid by and she used to tell her child his father would be home to help them before it was spent and with these bright hopes and that treasury of bliss her boy she spent some happy months time wore on and no gerard came and stranger still no news of him then her mind was disquieted and contrary to her nature which was practical she was often lost in sad reverie and sighed in silence and while her heart was troubled her money was melting and so it was that one day she found the cupboard empty and looked in her dependents faces and at the sight of them her bosom was all pity and she appealed to the baby whether she could let grandfather and poor old martin want a meal and went and took out catherines angel as she unfolded the linen a tear of gentle mortification fell on it she sent martin out to change it while he was gone a frenchman came with one of the dealers in illuminated work who had offered her so poor a price he told her he was employed by his sovereign to collect masterpieces for her book of hours then she showed him the two best things she had and he was charmed with one of them viz the flowers and raspberries and creeping things which margaret van eyck had shaded he offered her an unheardof price nay flout not my need good stranger said she three mouths there be in this house and none to fill them but me curious arithmetic left out no id out thee not fair mistress my princess charged me strictly seek the best craftsmen but i will no hard bargains make them content with me and me with them the next minute margaret was on her knees kissing little gerard in the cradle and showering four gold pieces on him again and again and relating the whole occurrence to him in very broken dutch and oh what a good princess wasnt she we will pray for her wont we my lambkin when we are old enough martin came in furious they will not change it i trow they think i stole it i am beholden to thee said margaret hastily and almost snatched it from martin and wrapped it up again and restored it to its hidingplace ere these unexpected funds were spent she got to her ironing and starching again in the midst of which martin sickened and died after an illness of nine days nearly all her money went to bury him decently he was gone and there was an empty chair by her fireside for he had preferred the hearth to the sun as soon as the busy body was gone margaret would not allow anybody to sit in this chair now yet whenever she let her eye dwell too long on it vacant it was sure to cost her a tear and now there was nobody to carry her linen home to do it herself she must leave little gerard in charge of a neighbour but she dared not trust such a treasure to mortal and besides she could not bear him out of her sight for hours and hours so she set inquiries on foot for a boy to carry her basket on saturday and monday a plump freshcoloured youth called luke peterson who looked fifteen but was eighteen came in and blushing and twiddling his bonnet asked her if a man would not serve her turn as well as a boy before he spoke she was saying to herself this boy will just do but she took the cue and said nay but a man will maybe seek more than i can well pay not i said luke warmly why mistress margaret i am your neighbour and i do very well at the coopering i can carry your basket for you before or after my days work and welcome you have no need to pay me anything tisnt as if we were strangers ye know why master luke i know your face for that matter but i cannot call to mind that ever a word passed between us oh yes you did mistress margaret what have you forgotten one day you were trying to carry your baby and eke your pitcher full o water and quo i give me the baby to carry nay says you ill give you the pitcher and keep the bairn myself and i carried the pitcher home and you took it from me at this door and you said to me i am muckle obliged to you young man with such a sweet voice not like the folk in this street speak to a body i do mind now master luke and methinks it was the least i could say well mistress margaret if you will say as much every time i carry your basket i care not how often i bear it nor how far nay nay said margaret colouring faintly i would not put upon good nature you are young master luke and kindly say i give you your supper on saturday night when you bring the linen home and your dawnmete o monday would that make us anyways even as you please only say not i sought a couple o diets for such a trifle as yon with chubbyfaced lukes timely assistance and the health and strength which heaven gave this poor young woman to balance her many ills the house went pretty smoothly awhile but the heart became more and more troubled by gerards long and now most mysterious silence and then that mental torturer suspense began to tear her heavy heart with his hot pincers till she cried often and vehemently oh that i could know the worst whilst she was in this state one day she heard a heavy step mount the stair she started and trembled that is no step that i know ill tidings the door opened and an unexpected visitor eli came in looking grave and kind margaret eyed him in silence and with increasing agitation girl said he the skipper is come back one word gasped margaret is he alive surely i hope so no one has seen him dead then they must have seen him alive no girl neither dead nor alive hath he been seen this many months in rome my daughter kate thinks he is gone to some other city she bade me tell you her thought ay like enough said margaret gloomily like enough my poor babe the old man in a faintish voice asked her for a morsel to eat he had come fasting the poor thing pitied him with the surface of her agitated mind and cooked a meal for him trembling and scarce knowing what she was about ere he went he laid his hand upon her head and said be he alive or be he dead i look on thee as my daughter can i do nought for thee this day bethink thee now ay old man pray for him and for me eli sighed and went sadly and heavily down the stairs she listened half stupidly to his retiring footsteps till they ceased then she sank moaning down by the cradle and drew little gerard tight to her bosom oh my poor fatherless boy my fatherless boy chapter lxxvii not long after this as the little family at tergou sat at dinner luke peterson burst in on them covered with dust good people mistress catherine is wanted instantly at rotterdam my name is catherine young man kate it will be margaret ay dame she said to me good luke hie thee to tergou and ask for eli the hosier and pray his wife catherine to come to me for god his love i didnt wait for daylight holy saints he has come home kate nay she would sure have said so what on earth can it be and she heaped conjecture on conjecture mayhap the young man can tell us hazarded kate timidly that i can said luke why her babe is adying and she was so wrapped up in it catherine started up what is his trouble nay i know not but it has been peaking and pining worse and worse this while a furtive glance of satisfaction passed between cornelis and sybrandt luckily for them catherine did not see it her face was turned towards her husband now eli cried she furiously if you say a word against it you and i shall quarrel after all these years who gainsays thee foolish woman quarrel with your own shadow while i go borrow peters mule for ye bless thee my good man bless thee didst never yet fail me at a pinch now eat your dinners who can while i go and make ready she took luke back with her in the cart and on the way questioned and crossquestioned him severely and seductively by turns till she had turned his mind inside out what there was of it margaret met her at the door pale and agitated and threw her arms round her neck and looked imploringly in her face come he is alive thank god said catherine after scanning her eagerly she looked at the failing child and then at the poor holloweyed mother alternately lucky you sent for me said she the child is poisoned poisoned by whom by you you have been fretting nay indeed mother how can i help fretting dont tell me margaret a nursing mother has no business to fret she must turn her mind away from her grief to the comfort that lies in her lap know you not that the child pines if the mother vexes herself this comes of your reading and writing those idle crafts befit a man but they keep all useful knowledge out of a woman the child must be weaned oh you cruel woman cried margaret vehemently i am sorry i sent for you would you rob me of the only bit of comfort i have in the world anursing my gerard i forget i am the most unhappy creature beneath the sun that you do not was the retort or he would not be the way he is mother said margaret imploringly tis hard replied catherine relenting but bethink thee would it not be harder to look down and see his lovely wee face alooking up at you out of a little coffin oh jesu and how could you face your other troubles with your heart aye full and your lap empty oh mother i consent to anything only save my boy that is a good lass trust to me i do stand by and see clearer than thou unfortunately there was another consent to be gainedthe babes and he was more refractory than his mother there said margaret trying to affect regret at his misbehaviour he loves me too well but catherine was a match for them both as she came along she had observed a healthy young woman sitting outside her own door with an infant hard by she went and told her the case and would she nurse the pining child for the nonce till she had matters ready to wean him the young woman consented with a smile and popped her child into the cradle and came into margarets house she dropped a curtsey and catherine put the child into her hands she examined and pitied it and purred over it and proceeded to nurse it just as if it had been her own margaret who had been paralyzed at her assurance cast a rueful look at catherine and burst out crying the visitor looked up what is to do wife ye told me not the mother was unwilling she is not she is only a fool never heed her and you margaret i am ashamed of you you are a cruel hardhearted woman sobbed margaret them as take in hand to guide the weak need be hardish and you will excuse me but you are not my flesh and blood and your boy is after giving this blunt speech time to sink she added come now she is robbing her own to save yours and you can think of nothing better than bursting out ablubbering in the womans face out fie for shame nay wife said the nurse thank heaven i have enough for my own and for hers to boot and prithee wyte not on her maybe the troubles o life ha soured her own milk and her heart into the bargain said the remorseless catherine margaret looked her full in the face and down went her eyes i know i ought to be very grateful to you sobbed margaret to the nurse then turned her head and leaned away over the chair not to witness the intolerable sight of another nursing her gerard and gerard drawing no distinction between this new mother and her the banished one the nurse replied you are very welcome my poor woman and so are you mistress catherine which are my townswoman and know it not what are ye from tergou all the better but i cannot call your face to mind oh you know not me my husband and me we are very humble folk by you but true eli and his wife are known of all the town and respected so i am at your call dame and at yours wife and yours my pretty poppet night or day theres a woman of the right old sort said catherine as the door closed upon her i hate her i hate her i hate her said margaret with wonderful fervour catherine only laughed at this outburst that is right said she better say it as set sly and think it it is very natural after all come here is your bundle o comfort take and hate that if ye can and she put the child in her lap no no said margaret turning her head half way from him she could not for her life turn the other half he is not my child now he is hers i know not why she left him here for my part it was very good of her not to take him to her house cradle and all oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ah well one comfort he is not dead this gives me light some other woman has got him away from me like father like son oh oh oh oh oh catherine was sorry for her and let her cry in peace and after that when she wanted joans aid she used to take gerard out to give him a little fresh air margaret never objected nor expressed the least incredulity but on their return was always in tears this connivance was shortlived she was now altogether as eager to wean little gerard it was done and he recovered health and vigour and another trouble fell upon him directly teething but here catherines experience was invaluable and now in the midst of her grief and anxiety about the father margaret had moments of bliss watching the sons tiny teeth come through teeth mother i call them not teeth but pearls of pearls and each pearl that peeped and sparkled on his red gums was to her the greatest feat nature had ever achieved her companion partook the illusion and had we told them standing corn was equally admirable margaret would have changed to a reproachful gazelle and catherine turned us out of doors so each pearls arrival was announced with a shriek of triumph by whichever of them was the fortunate discoverer catherine gossiped with joan and learned that she was the wife of jorian ketel of tergou who had been servant to ghysbrecht van swieten but fallen out of favour and come back to rotterdam his native place his friends had got him the place of sexton to the parish and what with that and carpentering he did pretty well catherine told joan in return whose child it was she had nursed and all about margaret and gerard and the deep anxiety his silence had plunged them in ay said joan the world is full of trouble one day she said to catherine its my belief my man knows more about your gerard than anybody in these parts but he has got to be closer than ever of late drop in some day just afore sunset and set him talking and for our ladys sake say not i set you on the only hiding he ever gave me was for babbling his business and i do not want another gramercy i married a man for the comfort of the thing not to be hided catherine dropped in jorian was ready enough to tell her how he had befriended her son and perhaps saved his life but this was no news to catherine and the moment she began to crossquestion him as to whether he could guess why her lost boy neither came nor wrote he cast a grim look at his wife who received it with a calm air of stolid candour and innocent unconsciousness and his answers became short and sullen what should he know more than another and so on he added after a pause think you the burgomaster takes such as me into his secrets oh then the burgomaster knows something said catherine sharply likely who else should ill ask him i would and tell him you say he knows that is right dame go make him mine enemy that is what a poor fellow always gets if he says a word to you women and jorian from that moment shrunk in and became impenetrable as a hedgehog and almost as prickly his conduct caused both the poor women agonies of mind alarm and irritated curiosity ghysbrecht was for some cause gerards mortal enemy had stopped his marriage imprisoned him hunted him and here was his late servant who when off his guard had hinted that this enemy had the clue to gerards silence after sifting jorians every word and look all remained dark and mysterious then catherine told margaret to go herself to him you are young you are fair you will maybe get more out of him than i could the conjecture was a reasonable one margaret went with her child in her arms and tapped timidly at jorians door just before sunset come in said a sturdy voice she entered and there sat jorian by the fireside at sight of her he rose snorted and burst out of the house is that for me wife inquired margaret turning very red you must excuse him replied joan rather coldly he lays it to your door that he is a poor man instead of a rich one it is something about a piece of parchment there was one amissing and he got nought from the burgomaster all along of that one alas gerard took it likely but my man says you should not have let him you were pledged to him to keep them all safe and sooth to say i blame not my jorian for being wroth tis hard for a poor man to be so near fortune and lose it by those he has befriended however i tell him another story says i folk that are out o trouble like you and me didnt ought to be too hard on folk that are in trouble and she has plenty going already what is all your hurry mistress oh it is not for me to drive the goodman out of his own house well let me kiss the bairn afore ye go he is not in fault anyway poor innocent upon this cruel rebuff margaret came to a resolution which she did not confide even to catherine after six weeks stay that good woman returned home on the childs birthday which occurred soon after margaret did no work but put on her sunday clothes and took her boy in her arms and went to the church and prayed there long and fervently for gerards safe return that same day and hour father clement celebrated a mass and prayed for margarets departed soul in the minster church at basle chapter lxxviii some blackguard or other i think it was sybrandt said a lie is not like a blow with a curtal axe true for we can predict in some degree the consequences of a stroke with any material weapon but a lie has no bounds at all the nature of the thing is to ramify beyond human calculation often in the everyday world a lie has cost a life or laid waste two or three and so in this story what tremendous consequences of that one heartless falsehood yet the tellers reaped little from it the brothers who invented it merely to have one claimant the less for their fathers property saw little gerard take their brothers place in their mothers heart nay more one day eli openly proclaimed that gerard being lost and probably dead he had provided by will for little gerard and also for margaret his poor sons widow at this the look that passed between the black sheep was a caution to traitors cornelis had it on his lips to say gerard was most likely alive but he saw his mother looking at him and checked himself in time ghysbrecht van swieten the other partner in that lie was now a failing man he saw the period fast approaching when all his wealth would drop from his body and his misdeeds cling to his soul too intelligent to deceive himself entirely he had never been free from gusts of remorse in taking gerards letter to margaret he had compounded i cannot give up land and money said his giant avarice i will cause her no unnecessary pain said his dwarf conscience so after first tampering with the seal and finding there was not a syllable about the deed he took it to her with his own hand and made a merit of it to himself a setoff and on a scale not uncommon where the selfaccuser is the judge the birth of margarets child surprised and shocked him and put his treacherous act in a new light should his letter take effect he should cause the dishonour of her who was the daughter of one friend the granddaughter of another and whose land he was keeping from her too these thoughts preying on him at that period of life when the strength of body decays and the memory of old friends revives filled him with gloomy horrors yet he was afraid to confess for the cure was an honest man and would have made him disgorge and with him avarice was an ingrained habit penitence only a sentiment matters were thus when one day returning from the town hall to his own house he found a woman waiting for him in the vestibule with a child in her arms she was veiled and so concluding she had something to be ashamed of he addressed her magisterially on this she let down her veil and looked him full in the face it was margaret brandt her sudden appearance and manner startled him and he could not conceal his confusion where is my gerard cried she her bosom heaving is he alive for aught i know stammered ghysbrecht i hope so for your sake prithee come into this room the servants not a step said margaret and she took him by the shoulder and held him with all the energy of an excited woman you know the secret of that which is breaking my heart why does not my gerard come nor send a line this many months answer me or all the town is like to hear me let alone thy servants my misery is too great to be sported with in vain he persisted he knew nothing about gerard she told him those who had sent her to him told her another tale you do know why he neither comes nor sends said she firmly at this ghysbrecht turned paler and paler but he summoned all his dignity and said would you believe those two knaves against a man of worship what two knaves said she keenly he stammered said ye not there i am a poor old broken man whose memory is shaken and you come here and confuse me so i know not what i say ay sir your memory is shaken or sure you would not be my enemy my father saved you from the plague when none other would come anigh you and was ever your friend my grandfather floris helped you in your early poverty and loved you man and boy three generations of us you have seen and here is the fourth of us this is your old friend peters grandchild and your old friend floris his greatgrandchild look down on his innocent face and think of theirs woman you torture me sighed ghysbrecht and sank upon a bench but she saw her advantage and kneeled before him and put the boy on his knees this fatherless babe is poor margaret brandts that never did you ill and comes of a race that loved you nay look at his face twill melt thee more than any word of mine saints of heaven what can a poor desolate girl and her babe have done to wipe out all memory of thine own young days when thou wert guiltless as he is that now looks up in thy face and implores thee to give him back his father and with her arms under the child she held him up higher and higher smiling under the old mans eyes he cast a wild look of anguish on the child and another on the kneeling mother and started up shrieking avaunt ye pair of adders the stung soul gave the old limbs a momentary vigour and he walked rapidly wringing his hands and clutching at his white hair forget those days i forget all else oh woman woman sleeping or waking i see but the faces of the dead i hear but the voices of the dead and i shall soon be among the dead there there what is done is done i am in hell i am in hell and unnatural force ended in prostration he staggered and but for margaret would have fallen with her one disengaged arm she supported him as well as she could and cried for help a couple of servants came running and carried him away in a state bordering on syncope the last margaret saw of him was his old furrowed face white and helpless as his hair that hung down over the servants elbow heaven forgive me she said i doubt i have killed the poor old man then this attempt to penetrate the torturing mystery left it as dark or darker than before for when she came to ponder every word her suspicion was confirmed that ghysbrecht did know something about gerard and who were the two knaves he thought had done a good deed and told me oh my gerard my poor deserted babe you and i are wading in deep waters the visit to tergou took more money than she could well afford and a customer ran away in her debt she was once more compelled to unfold catherines angel but strange to say as she came down stairs with it in her hand she found some loose silver on the table with a written line for gerard his wife she fell with a cry of surprise on the writing and soon it rose into a cry of joy he is alive he sends me this by some friendly hand she kissed the writing again and again and put it in her bosom time rolled on and no news of gerard and about every two months a small sum in silver found its way into the house sometimes it lay on the table once it was flung in through the bedroom window in a purse once it was at the bottom of lukes basket he had stopped at the publichouse to talk to a friend the giver or his agent was never detected catherine disowned it margaret van eyck swore she had no hand in it so did eli and margaret whenever it came used to say to little gerard oh my poor deserted child you and i are wading in deep waters she applied at least half this modest but useful supply to dressing the little gerard beyond his station in life if it does come from gerard he shall see his boy neat all the mothers in the street began to sneer especially such as had brats out at elbows the months rolled on and dead sickness of heart succeeded to these keener torments she returned to her first thought gerard must be dead she should never see her boys father again nor her marriage lines this last grief which had been somewhat allayed by eli and catherine recognizing her betrothal now revived in full force others would not look so favourably on her story and often she moaned over her boys illegitimacy is it not enough for us to be bereaved must we be dishonoured too oh that we had neer been born a change took place in peter brandt his mind clouded for nearly two years seemed now to be clearing he had intervals of intelligence and then he and margaret used to talk of gerard till he wandered again but one day returning after an absence of some hours margaret found him conversing with catherine in a way he had never done since his paralytic stroke eh girl why must you be out said she but indeed i have told him all and we have been acrying together over thy troubles margaret stood silent looking joyfully from one to the other peter smiled on her and said come let me bless thee she kneeled at his feet and he blessed her most eloquently he told her she had been all her life the lovingest truest and most obedient daughter heaven ever sent to a poor old widowed man may thy son be to thee what thou hast been to me after this he dozed then the females whispered together and catherine saidall our talk een now was of gerard it lies heavy on his mind his poor head must often have listened to us when it seemed quite dark margaret he is a very understanding man he thought of many things he may be in prison says he or forced to go fighting for some king or sent to constantinople to copy books there or gone into the church after all he had a bent that way ah mother whispered margaret in reply he doth but deceive himself as we do ere she could finish the sentence a strange interruption occurred a loud voice cried out i see him i see him and the old man with dilating eyes seemed to be looking right through the wall of the house in a boat on a great river coming this way sore disfigured but i knew him gone gone all dark and he sank back and asked feebly where was margaret dear father i am by thy side oh mother mother what is this i cannot see thee and but a moment agone i saw all round the world ay ay well i am ready is this thy hand bless thee my child bless thee weep not the tree is ripe the old physician read the signs aright these calm words were his last the next moment he drooped his head and gently placidly drifted away from earth like an infant sinking to rest the torch had flashed up before going out chapter lxxix she who had wept for poor old martin was not likely to bear this blow so stoically as the death of the old is apt to be borne in vain catherine tried to console her with commonplaces in vain told her it was a happy release for him and that as he himself had said the tree was ripe but her worst failure was when she urged that there were now but two mouths to feed and one care the less such cares are all the joys i have said margaret they fill my desolate heart which now seems void as well as waste oh empty chair my bosom it aches to see thee poor old man how could i love him by halves i that did use to sit and look at him and think but for me thou wouldst die of hunger he so wise so learned erst was got to be helpless as my own sweet babe and i loved him as if he had been my child instead of my father oh empty chair oh empty heart welladay welladay and the pious tears would not be denied then catherine held her peace and hung her head and one day she made this confession i speak to thee out o my head and not out o my bosom thou dost well to be deaf to me were i in thy place i should mourn the old man all one as thou dost then margaret embraced her and this bit of true sympathy did her a little good the commonplaces did none then catherines bowels yearned over her and she said my poor girl you were not born to live alone i have got to look on you as my own daughter waste not thine youth upon my son gerard either he is dead or he is a traitor it cuts my heart to say it but who can help seeing it thy father is gone and i cannot always be aside thee and here is an honest lad that loves thee well this many a day id take him and comfort together heaven hath sent us these creatures to torment us and comfort us and all we are just nothing in the world without em then seeing margaret look utterly perplexed she went on to say why sure you are not so blind as not to see it what who who but this luke peterson what our luke the boy that carries my basket nay he is over nineteen and a fine healthy lad and i have made inquiries for you and they all do say he is a capable workman and never touches a drop and that is much in a rotterdam lad which they are mostly half man half sponge margaret smiled for the first time this many days luke loves dried puddings dearly said she and i make them to his mind tis them he comes acourting here then she suddenly turned red but if i thought he came after your sons wife that is or ought to be id soon put him to the door nay nay for heavens sake let me not make mischief poor lad why girl fancy will not be bridled bless you i wormed it out of him near a twelvemonth agone oh mother and you let him well i thought of you i said to myself if he is fool enough to be her slave for nothing all the better for her a lone woman is lost without a man about her to fetch and carry her little matters but now my mind is changed and i think the best use you can put him to is to marry him so then his own mother is against him and would wed me to the first comer an gerard thou hast but me i will not believe thee dead till i see thy tomb nor false till i see thee with another lover in thine hand foolish boy i shall neer be civil to him again afflicted with the busybodys protection luke peterson met a cold reception in the house where he had hitherto found a gentle and kind one and byandby finding himself very little spoken to at all and then sharply and irritably the great soft fellow fell to whimpering and asked margaret plump if he had done anything to offend her nothing i am to blame i am curst if you will take my counsel you will keep out of my way awhile it is all along of me luke said the busybody you mistress catherine why what have i done for you to set her against me nay i meant all for the best i told her i saw you were looking towards her through a wedding ring but she wont hear of it there was no need to tell her that wife she knows i am courting her this twelvemonth not i said margaret or i should never have opened the street door to you why i come here every saturday night and that is how the lads in rotterdam do court if we sup with a lass o saturdays that wooing oh that is rotterdam is it then next time you come let it be thursday or friday for my part i thought you came after my puddings boy i like your puddings well enough you make them better than mother does but i like you still better than the puddings said luke tenderly then you have seen the last of them how dare you talk so to another mans wife and him far away she ended gently but very firmly you need not trouble yourself to come here any more luke i can carry my basket myself oh very well said luke and after sitting silent and stupid for a little while he rose and said sadly to catherine dame i daresay i have got the sack and went out but the next saturday catherine found him seated on the doorstep blubbering he told her he had got used to come there and every other place seemed strange she went in and told margaret and margaret sighed and said poor luke he might come in for her if he could know his place and treat her like a married wife on this being communicated to luke he hesitated pshaw said catherine promises are piecrusts promise her all the world sooner than sit outside like a fool when a word will carry you inside now you humour her in everything and then if poor gerard come not home and claim her you will be sure to have herin time a lone woman is aye to be tired out thou foolish boy chapter lxxx the cloister brother clement had taught and preached in basle more than a twelvemonth when one day jerome stood before him dusty with a triumphant glance in his eye give the glory to god brother clement thou canst now wend to england with me i am ready brother jerome and expecting thee these many months have in the intervals of teaching and devotion studied the english tongue somewhat closely twas well thought of said jerome he then told him he had but delayed till he could obtain extraordinary powers from the pope to collect money for the churchs use in england and to hear confession in all the secular monasteries so now gird up thy loins and let us go forth and deal a good blow for the church and against the franciscans the two friars went preaching down the rhine for england in the larger places they both preached at the smaller they often divided and took different sides of the river and met again at some appointed spot both were able orators but in different styles jeromes was noble and impressive but a little contracted in religious topics and a trifle monotonous in delivery compared with clements though in truth not so compared with most preachers clements was full of variety and often remarkably colloquial in its general flow tender and gently winning it curled round the reason and the heart but it always rose with the rising thought and so at times clement soared as far above jerome as his level speaking was below him indeed in these noble heats he was all that we hue read of inspired prophet or heathen orator vehemens ut procella excitatus ut torrens incensus ut fulmen tonabat fulgurabat et rapidis eloquentiae fiuctibus cuncta proruebat et perturbabat i would give literal specimens but for five objections it is difficult time is short i have done it elsewhere an able imitator has since done it better and similarity a virtue in peas is a vice in books but not to evade the matter entirely clement used secretly to try and learn the recent events and the besetting sin of each town he was to preach in but jerome the unbending scorned to go out of his way for any peoples vices at one great town some leagues from the rhine they mounted the same pulpit in turn jerome preached against vanity in dress a favourite theme of his he was eloquent and satirical and the people listened with complacency it was a vice that they were little given to clement preached against drunkenness it was a besetting sin and sacred from preaching in these parts for the clergy themselves were infected with it and popular prejudice protected it clement dealt it merciless blows out of holy writ and worldly experience a crime itself it was the nursing mother of most crimes especially theft and murder he reminded them of a parricide that had lately been committed in their town by all honest man in liquor and also how a band of drunkards had roasted one of their own comrades alive at a neighbouring village your last prince said he is reported to have died of apoplexy but well you know he died of drink and of your aldermen one perished miserably last month dead drunk suffocated in a puddle your childrens backs go bare that you may fill your bellies with that which makes you the worst of beasts silly as calves yet fierce as boars and drives your families to need and your souls to hell i tell ye your town ay and your very nation would sink to the bottom of mankind did your women drink as you do and how long will they be temperate and contrary to nature resist the example of their husbands and fathers vice neer yet stood still ye must amend yourselves or see them come down to your mark already in bohemia they drink along with the men how shows a drunken woman would you love to see your wives drunken your mothers drunken at this there was a shout of horror for mediaeval audiences had not learned to sit mumchance at a moving sermon ah that comes home to you cried the friar what madmen think you it doth not more shock the allpure god to see a man his noblest work turned to a drunken beast than it can shock you creatures of sin and unreason to see a woman turned into a thing no better nor worse than yourselves he ended with two pictures a drunkards house and family and a sober mans both so true and dramatic in all their details that the wives fell all to ohing and ahing and eh but that is a true word this discourse caused quite all uproar the hearers formed knots the men were indignant so the women flattered them and took their part openly against the preacher a married man had a right to a drop he needed it working for all the family and for their part they did not care to change their men for milksops the double faces that very evening a hand of men caught near a hundred of them round brother clement filling his wallet with the best and offering him the very roses off their heads and kissing his frock and blessing him for taking in hand to mend their sots jerome thought this sermon too earthly drunkenness is not heresy clement that a whole sermon should be preached against it as they went on he found to his surprise that clements sermons sank into his hearers deeper than his own made them listen think cry and sometimes even amend their ways he hath the art of sinking to their peg thought jerome yet he can soar high enough at times upon the whole it puzzled jerome who had a secret sense of superiority to his tenderer brother and after about two hundred miles of it it got to displease him as well as puzzle him but he tried to check this sentiment as petty and unworthy souls differ like locks said he and preachers must differ like keys or the fewer should the church open for god to pass in and certes this novice hath the key to these northern souls being himself a northern man and so they came slowly down the rhine sometimes drifting a few miles down the stream but in general walking by the banks preaching and teaching and confessing sinners in the towns and villages and they reached the town of dusseldorf there was the little quay where gerard and denys had taken boat up the rhine the friars landed on it there were the streets there was the silver lion nothing had changed but he who walked through it barefoot with his heart calm and cold his hands across his breast and his eyes bent meekly on the ground a true son of dominic and holy church chapter lxxxi the hearth eli said catherine answer me one question like a man and ill ask no more today what is wormwood eli looked a little helpless at this sudden demand upon his faculties but soon recovered enough to say it was something that tasted main bitter that is a fair answer my man but not the one i look for then answer it yourself and shall wormwood isto have two in the house adoing nought but waiting for thy shoes and mine eli groaned the shaft struck home methinks waiting for their best friends coffin that and nothing to do are enow to make them worse than nature meant why not set them up somewhere to give em a chance eli said he was willing but afraid they would drink and gamble their very shelves away nay said catherine dost take me for a simpleton of course i mean to watch them at starting and drive them wi a loose rein as the saying is where did you think of not here to divide our own custom not likely i say rotterdam against the world then i could start them oh selfdeception the true motive of all this was to get near little gerard after many discussions and eager promises of amendment on these terms from cornelis and sybrandt catherine went to rotterdam shophunting and took kate with her for a change they soon found one and in a good street but it was sadly out of order however they got it cheaper for that and instantly set about brushing it up fitting proper shelves for the business and making the dwellinghouse habitable luke peterson was always asking margaret what he could do for her the answer used to be in a sad tone nothing luke nothing what you that are so clever can you think of nothing for me to do for you nothing luke nothing but at last she varied the reply thus if you could make something to help my sweet sister kate about the slave of love consented joyfully and soon made kate a little cart and cushioned it and yoked himself into it and at eventide drew her out of the town and along the pleasant boulevard with margaret and catherine walking beside it looked a happier party than it was kate for one enjoyed it keenly for little gerard was put in her lap and she doted on him and it was like a cherub carried by a little angel or a rosebud lying in the cup of a lily so the vulgar jeered and asked luke how a thistle tasted and if his mistress could not afford one with four legs etc luke did not mind these jeers but kate minded them for him thou hast made the cart for me good luke said she twas much i did ill to let thee draw me too we can afford to pay some poor soul for that i love my rides and to carry little gerard but id liever ride no more than thou be mocked fort much i care for their tongues said luke if i did care id knock their heads together i shall draw you till my mistress says give over luke if you obey kate you will oblige me then i will obey kate an honourable exception to popular humour was jorian ketels wife that is strength well laid out to draw the weak and her prayers will be your guerdon she is not long for this world she smileth in pain these were the words of joan singleminded luke answered that he did not want the poor lasss prayers he did it to please his mistress margaret after that luke often pressed margaret to give him something to dowithout success but one day as if tired with his importuning she turned on him and said with a look and accent i should in vain try to convey find me my boys father chapter lxxxii mistress they all say he is dead not so they feed me still with hopes ay to your face but behind your back they all say he is dead at this revelation margarets tears began to flow luke whimpered for company he had the body of a man but the heart of a girl prithee weep not so sweet mistress said he id bring him back to life an i could rather than see thee weed so sore margaret said she thought she was weeping because they were so doubletongued with her she recovered herself and laying her hand on his shoulder said solemnly luke he is not dead dying men are known to have a strange sight and listen luke my poor father when he was adying and i simple fool was so happy thinking he was going to get well altogether he said to mother and mehe was sitting in that very chair where you are now and mother was as might be here and i was yonder making a sleevesaid he i see him i see him just so not like a failing man at all but all o fire sore disfiguredon a great rivercoming this way ah luke if you were a woman and had the feeling for me you think you have you would pity me and find him for me take a thought the father of my child alack i would if i knew how said luke but how can i nay of course you cannot i am mad to think it but oh if any one really cared for me they would that is all i know luke reflected in silence for some time the old folk all say dying men can see more than living wights let me think for my mind cannot gallop like thine on a great river well the maas is a great river he pondered on coming this way then if it twas the maas he would have been here by this time so tis not the maas the rhine is a great river greater than the maas and very long i think it will be the rhine and so do i luke for denys bade him come down the rhine but even if it is he may turn off before he comes anigh his birthplace he does not pine for me as i for him that is clear luke do you not think he has deserted me she wanted him to contradict her but he said it looks very like it what a fool he must be what do we know objected margaret imploringly let me think again said luke i cannot gallop the result of this meditation was this he knew a station about sixty miles up the rhine where all the public boats put in and he would go to that station and try and cut the truant off to be sure he did not even know him by sight but as each boat came in he would mingle with the passengers and ask if one gerard was there and mistress if you were to give me a bit of a letter to him for with us being strangers mayhap a wont believe a word i say good kind thoughtful luke i will how i have undervalued thee but give me till suppertime to get it writ at supper she put a letter into his hand with a blush it was a long letter tied round with silk after the fashion of the day and sealed over the knot luke weighed it in his hand with a shade of discontent and said to her very gravely say your father was not dreaming and say i have the luck to fall in with this man and say he should turn out a better bit of stuff than i think him and come home to you then and therewhat is to become o me margaret coloured to her very brow oh luke heaven will reward thee and i shall fall on my knees and bless thee and i shall love thee all my days sweet luke as a mother does her son i am so old by thee trouble ages the heart thou shalt not go tis not fair of me love maketh us to be all self humph said luke and if resumed he in the same grave way yon scapegrace shall read thy letter and hear me tell him how thou pinest for him and yet being a traitor or a mere idiot will not turn to thee what shall become of me then must i die a bachelor and thou fare lonely to thy grave neither maid wife nor widow margaret panted with fear and emotion at this terrible piece of good sense and the plain question which followed it but at last she faltered out if which our lady be merciful to me and forbidoh well mistress if he should read my letter and hear thy wordsand sweet luke be just and tell him what a lovely babe he hath fatherless fatherless oh luke can he be so cruel i trow not but if then he will give thee up my marriage lines and i shall be an honest woman and a wretched one and my boy will not be a bastard and of course then we could both go into any honest mans house that would be troubled with us and even for thy goodness this day i willi willneer be so ungrateful as go past thy door to another mans ay but will you come in at mine answer me that oh ask me not some day perhaps when my wounds leave bleeding alas ill try if i dont fling myself and my child into the maas do not go luke do not think of going tis all madness from first to last but luke was as slow to forego an idea as to form one his reply showed how fast love was making a man of him well said he madness is something anyway and i am tired of doing nothing for thee and i am no great talker tomorrow at peep of day i start but hold i have no money my mother she takes care of all mine and i neer see it again then margaret took out catherines gold angel which had escaped so often and gave it to luke and he set out on his mad errand it did not however seem so mad to him as to us it was a superstitious age and luke acted on the dying mans dream or vision or illusion or whatever it was much as we should act on respectable information but catherine was downright angry when she heard of it to send the poor lad on such a wildgoose chase but you are like a many more girls and mark my words by the time you have worn that luke fairly out and made him as sick of you as a dog you will turn as fond on him as a cow on a calf and too late will be the cry the cloister the two friars reached holland from the south just twelve hours after luke started up the rhine thus wildgoose chase or not the parties were nearing each other and rapidly too for jerome unable to preach in low dutch now began to push on towards the coast anxious to get to england as soon as possible and having the stream with them the friars would in point of fact have missed luke by passing him in full stream below his station but for the incident which i am about to relate about twenty miles above the station luke was making for clement landed to preach in a large village and towards the end of his sermon he noticed a grey nun weeping he spoke to her kindly and asked her what was her grief nay said she tis not for myself flow these tears tis for my lost friend thy words reminded me of what she was and what she is poor wretch but you are a dominican and i am a franciscan nun it matters little my sister if we are both christians and if i can aid thee in aught the nun looked in his face and said these are strange words but methinks they are good and thy lips are oh most eloquent i will tell thee our grief she then let him know that a young nun the darling of the convent and her bosom friend had been lured away from her vows and after various gradations of sin was actually living in a small inn as chambermaid in reality as a decoy and was known to be selling her favours to the wealthier customers she added anywhere else we might by kindly violence force her away from perdition but this innkeeper was the servant of the fierce baron on the height there and hath his ear still and he would burn our convent to the ground were we to take her by force moreover souls will not be saved by brute force said clement while they were talking jerome came up and clement persuaded him to lie at the convent that night but when in the morning clement told him he had had a long talk with the abbess and that she was very sad and he had promised her to try and win back her nun jerome objected and said it was not their business and was a waste of time clement however was no longer a mere pupil he stood firm and at last they agreed that jerome should go forward and secure their passage in the next ship for england and clement be allowed time to make his wellmeant but idle experiment about ten oclock that day a figure in a horsemans cloak and great boots to match and a large flapping felt hat stood like a statue near the auberge where was the apostate nun mary the friar thus disguised was at that moment truly wretched these ardent natures undertake wonders but are dashed when they come hand to hand with the sickening difficulties but then as their hearts are steel though their nerves are anything but iron they turn not back but panting and dispirited struggle on to the last clement hesitated long at the door prayed for help and wisdom and at last entered the inn and sat down faint at heart and with his body in a cold perspiration but inside he was another man he called lustily for a cup of wine it was brought him by the landlord he paid for it with money the convent had supplied him and made a show of drinking it landlord said he i hear there is a fair chambermaid in thine house ay stranger the buxomest in holland but she gives not her company to all comers only to good customers friar clement dangled a massive gold chain in the landlords sight he laughed and shouted here janet here is a lover for thee would bind thee in chains of gold and a tall lad into the bargain i promise thee then i am in double luck said a female voice send him hither clement rose shuddered and passed into the room where janet was seated playing with a piece of work and laying it down every minute to sing a mutilated fragment of a song for in her mode of life she had not the patience to carry anything out after a few words of greeting the disguised visitor asked her if they could not be more private somewhere why not said she and she rose and smiled and went tripping before him he followed groaning inwardly and sore perplexed there said she have no fear nobody ever comes here but such as pay for the privilege clement looked round the room and prayed silently for wisdom then he went softly and closed the windowshutters carefully what on earth is that for said janet in some uneasiness sweetheart whispered the visitor with a mysterious air it is that god may not see us madman said janet think you a wooden shutter can keep out his eye nay i know not perchance he has too much on hand to notice us but i would not the saints and angels should see us would you my poor soul hope not to escape their sight the only way is not to think of them for if you do it poisons your cup for two pins id run and leave thee art pleasant company in sooth after all girl so that men see us not what signify god and the saints seeing us feel this chain tis virgin gold i shall cut two of these heavy links off for thee ah now thy discourse is to the point and she handled the chain greedily why tis as massy as the chain round the virgins neck at the conv she did not finish the word whisht whisht whisht tis it and thou shalt have thy share but betray me not monster cried janet drawing back from him with repugnance what rob the blessed virgin of her chain and give it to an you are none cried clement exultingly or you had not recked for thatmary ah ah ah thy patron saint whose chain this is sends me to greet thee she ran screaming to the window and began to undo the shutters her fingers trembled and clement had time to debarass himself of his boots and his hat before the light streamed in upon him he then let his cloak quietly fall and stood before her a dominican friar calm and majestic as a statue and held his crucifix towering over her with a loving sad and solemn look that somehow relieved her of the physical part of fear but crushed her with religious terror and remorse she crouched and cowered against the wall mary said he gently one word are you happy as happy as i shall be in hell and they are not happy at the convent they weep for you for me day and night above all the sister ursula poor ursula and the strayed nun began to weep herself at the thought of her friend the angels weep still more wilt not dry all their tears in earth and heaven and save thyself ay would i could but it is too late satan avaunt cried the monk sternly tis thy favourite temptation and thou mary listen not to the enemy of man belying god and whispering despair i who come to save thee have been a far greater sinner than thou come mary sin thou seest is not so sweet en in this world as holiness and eternity is at the door how can they ever receive me again tis their worthiness thou doubtest now but in truth they pine for thee twas in pity of their tears that i a dominican undertook this task and broke the rule of my order by entering an inn and broke it again by donning these lay vestments but all is well done and quit for a light penance if thou wilt let us rescue thy soul from this den of wolves and bring thee back to thy vows the nun gazed at him with tears in her eyes and thou a dominican hast done this for a daughter of st francis why the franciscans and dominicans hate one another ay my daughter but francis and dominic love one another the recreant nun seemed struck and affected by this answer clement now reminded her how shocked she had been that the virgin should be robbed of her chain but see now said he the convent and the virgin too think ten times more of their poor nun than of golden chains for they freely trusted their chain to me a stranger that peradventure the sight of it might touch their lost mary and remind her of their love finally he showed her with such terrible simplicity the end of her present course and on the other hand so revived her dormant memories and better feelings that she kneeled sobbing at his feet and owned she had never known happiness nor peace since she betrayed her vows and said she would go back if he would go with her but alone she dared not could not even if she reached the gate she could never enter how could she face the abbess and the sisters he told her he would go with her as joyfully as the shepherd bears a strayed lamb to the fold but when he urged her to go at once up sprung a crop of those prodigiously petty difficulties that entangle her sex like silken nets liker iron cobwebs he quietly swept them aside but how can i walk beside thee in this habit i have brought the gown and cowl of thy holy order hide thy bravery with them and leave thy shoes as i leave these pointing to his horsemans boots she collected her jewels and ornaments what are these for inquired clement to present to the convent father their source is too impure but objected the penitent it would be a sin to leave them here they can be sold to feed the poor mary fix thine eye on this crucifix and trample those devilish baubles beneath thy feet she hesitated but soon threw them down and trampled on them now open the window and fling them out on that dunghill tis well done so pass the wages of sin from thy hands its glittering yoke from thy neck its pollution from thy soul away daughter of st francis we tarry in this vile place too long she followed him but they were not clear yet at first the landlord was so astounded at seeing a black friar and a grey nun pass through his kitchen from the inside that he gaped and muttered why what mummery is this but he soon comprehended the matter and whipped in between the fugitives and the door what ho reuben carl gavin here is a false friar spiriting away our janet the men came running in with threatening looks the friar rushed at them crucifix in hand forbear he cried in a stentorian voice she is a holy nun returning to her vows the hand that touches her cowl or her robe to stay her it shall wither his body shall lie unburied cursed by rome and his soul shall roast in eternal fire they shrank back as if a flame had met them and thoumiserable panderer he did not end the sentence in words but seized the man by the neck and strong as a lion in his moments of hot excitement hurled him furiously from the door and sent him all across the room pitching head foremost on to the stone floor then tore the door open and carried the screaming nun out into the road hush poor trembler he gasped they dare not molest thee on the highroad away the landlord lay terrified half stunned and bleeding and mary though she often looked back apprehensively saw no more of him on the road he bade her observe his impetuosity hitherto said he we have spoken of thy faults now for mine my choler is ungovernable furious it is by the grace of god i am not a murderer i repent the next moment but a moment too late is all too late mary had the churls laid finger on thee i should have scattered their brains with my crucifix oh i know myself go to and tremble at myself there lurketh a wild beast beneath this black gown of mine alas father said mary were you other than you are i had been lost to take me from that place needed a man wary as a fox yet bold as a lion clement reflected this much is certain god chooseth well his fleshly instruments and with imperfect hearts doeth his perfect work glory be to god when they were near the convent mary suddenly stopped and seized the friars arm and began to cry he looked at her kindly and told her she had nothing to fear it would be the happiest day she had ever spent he then made her sit down and compose herself till he should return he entered the convent and desired to see the abbess my sister give the glory to god mary is at the gate the astonishment and delight of the abbess were unbounded she yielded at once to clements earnest request that the road of penitence might be smoothed at first to this unstable wanderer and after some opposition she entered heartily into his views as to her actual reception to give time for their little preparations clement went slowly back and seating himself by mary soothed her and heard her confession the abbess has granted me that you shall propose your own penance it shall be none the lighter said she i trow not said he but that is future today is given to joy alone he then led her round the building to the abbesss postern as they went they heard musical instruments and singing tis a feastday said mary and i come to mar it hardly said clement smiling seeing that you are the queen of the fete i father what mean you what mary have you never heard that there is more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth than over ninetynine just persons which need no repentance now this convent is not heaven nor the nuns angels yet are there among then some angelic spirits and these sing and exult at thy return but here methinks comes one of them for i see her hand trembles at the keyhole the postern was flung open and in a moment sister ursula clung sobbing and kissing round her friends neck the abbess followed more sedately but little less moved clement bade them farewell they entreated him to stay but he told them with much regret he could not he had already tried his good brother jeromes patience and must hasten to the river and perhaps sail for england tomorrow so mary returned to the fold and clement strode briskly on towards the rhine and england this was the man for whom margarets boy lay in wait with her letter the hearth and that letter was one of those simple touching appeals only her sex can write to those who have used them cruelly and they love them she began by telling him of the birth of the little boy and the comfort he had been to her in all the distress of mind his long and strange silence had caused her she described the little gerard minutely not forgetting the mole on his little finger know you any one that hath the like on his if you only saw him you could not choose but be proud of him all the mothers in the street do envy me but i the wives for thou comest not to us my own gerard some say thou art dead but if thou wert dead how could i be alive others say that thou whom i love so truly art false but this will i believe from no lips but thine my father loved thee well and as he lay adying he thought he saw thee on a great river with thy face turned towards thy margaret but sore disfigured ist so perchance have cruel men scarred thy sweet face or hast thou lost one of thy precious limbs why then thou hast the more need of me and i shall love thee not worse alas thinkest thou a womans love is light as a mans but better than i did when i shed those few drops from my arm not worth the tears thou didst shed for them mindest thou tis not so very long agone dear gerard the letter continued in this strain and concluded without a word of reproach or doubt as to his faith and affection not that she was free from most distressing doubts but they were not certainties and to show them might turn the scale and frighten him away from her with fear of being scolded and of this letter she made soft luke the bearer so she was not an angel after all luke mingled with the passengers of two boats and could hear nothing of gerard eliassoen nor did this surprise him he was more surprised when at the third attempt a black friar said to him somewhat severely and what would you with him you call gerard eliassoen why father if he is alive i have got a letter for him humph said jerome i am sorry for it however the flesh is weak well my son he you seek will be here by the next boat or the next boat after and if he chooses to answer to that nameafter all i am not the keeper of his conscience good father one plain word for heavens sake this gerard eliassoen of tergouis he alive humph why certes he that went by that name is alive well then that is settled said luke drily but the next moment he found it necessary to run out of sight and blubber oh why did the lord make any women said he to himself i was content with the world till i fell in love here his little finger is more to her than my whole body and he is not dead and here i have got to give him this he looked at the letter and dashed it on the ground but he picked it up again with a spiteful snatch and went to the landlord with tears in his eyes and begged for work the landlord declined said he had his own people oh i seek not your money said luke i only want some work to keep me from breaking my heart about another mans lass good lad good lad exploded the landlord and found him lots of barrels to mendon these terms and he coopered with fury in the interval of the boats coming down the rhine chapter lxxxiii the hearth waiting an earnest letter seldom leaves the mind in statu quo margaret in hers vented her energy and her faith in her dying fathers vision or illusion and when this was done and luke gone she wondered at her credulity and her conscience pricked her about luke and catherine came and scolded her and she paid the price of false hopes and elevation of spirits by falling into deeper despondency she was found in this state by a staunch friend she had lately made joan ketel this good woman came in radiant with an idea margaret i know the cure for thine ill the hermit of gouda a wondrous holy man why he can tell what is coming when he is in the mood ay i have heard of him said margaret hopelessly joan with some difficulty persuaded her to walk out as far as gouda and consult the hermit they took some butter and eggs in a basket and went to his cave what had made the pair such fast friends jorian some six weeks ago fell ill of a bowel disease it began with raging pain and when this went off leaving him weak an awkward symptom succeeded nothing either liquid or solid would stay in his stomach a minute the doctor said he must die if this goes on many hours therefore boil thou now a chicken with a golden angel in the water and let him sup that alas gilt chicken broth shared the fate of the humbler viands its predecessors then the cure steeped the thumb of st sergius in beef broth same result then joan ran weeping to margaret to borrow some linen to make his shroud let me see him said margaret she came in and felt his pulse ah said she i doubt they have not gone to the root open the window art stifling him now change all his linen alack woman what for why foul more linen for a dying man objected the mediaeval wife do as thou art bid said margaret dully and left the room joan somehow found herself doing as she was bid margaret returned with her apron full of a flowering herb she made a decoction and took it to the bedside and before giving it to the patient took a spoonful herself and smacked her lips hypocritically that is fair said he with a feeble attempt at humour why tis sweet and now tis bitter she engaged him in conversation as soon as he had taken it this bittersweet stayed by him seeing which she built on it as cards are built mixed a very little schiedam in the third spoonful and a little beaten yoke of egg in the seventh and so with the patience of her sex she coaxed his body out of deaths grasp and finally nature being patted on the back instead of kicked under the bed set jorian ketel on his legs again but the doctress made them both swear never to tell a soul her guilty deed they would put me in prison away from my child the simple that saved jorian was called sweet feverfew she gathered it in his own garden her eagle eye had seen it growing out of the window margaret and joan then reached the hermits cave and placed their present on the little platform margaret then applied her mouth to the aperture made for that purpose and said holy hermit we bring thee butter and eggs of the best and i a poor deserted girl wife yet no wife and mother of the sweetest babe come to pray thee tell me whether he is quick or dead true to his vows or false a faint voice issued from the cave trouble me not with the things of earth but send me a holy friar i am dying alas cried margaret is it een so poor soul then let us in to help thee saints forbid thine is a womans voice send me a holy friar they went back as they came joan could not help saying are women imps o darkness then that they must not come anigh a dying bed but margaret was too deeply dejected to say anything joan applied rough consolation but she was not listened to till she said and jorian will speak out ere long he is just on the boil he is very grateful to thee believe it seeing is believing replied margaret with quiet bitterness not but what he thinks you might have saved him with something more out o the common than yon a man of my inches to be cured wi feverfew says he why if there is a sorry herb says he why i was thinking o pulling all mine up says he i up and told him remedies were none the better for being farfetched you and feverfew cured him when the grand medicines came up faster than they went down so says i you may go down on your four bones to feverfew but indeed he is grateful at bottom you are all his thought and all his chat but he sees gerards folk coming around ye and good friends and he said only last night well he made me vow not to tell ye prithee tell me well he said an if i tell what little i know it wont bring him back and it will set them all by the ears i wish i had more headpiece said he i am sore perplexed but least said is soonest mended yon is his favourite word he comes back tot from a mile off margaret shook her head ay we are wading in deep waters my poor babe and me it was saturday night and no luke poor luke said margaret it was very good of him to go on such an errand he is one out of a hundred replied catherine warmly mother do you think he would be kind to little gerard i am sure he would so do you be kinder to him when he comes back will ye now ay the cloister brother clement directed by the nuns avoided a bend in the river and striding lustily forward reached a station some miles nearer the coast than that where luke lay in wait for gerard eliassoen and the next morning he started early and was in rotterdam at noon he made at once for the port not to keep jerome waiting he observed several monks of his order on the quay he went to them but jerome was not amongst them he asked one of them whether jerome had arrived surely brother was the reply prithee where is he where why there said the monk pointing to a ship in full sail and clement now noticed that all the monks were looking seaward what gone without me oh jerome jerome cried he in a voice of anguish several of the friars turned round and stared you must be brother clement said one of them at length and on this they kissed him and greeted him with brotherly warmth and gave him a letter jerome had charged them with for him it was a hasty scrawl the writer told him coldly a ship was about to sail for england and he was loth to lose time he clement might follow if he pleased but he would do much better to stay behind and preach to his own country folk give the glory to god brother you have a wonderful power over dutch hearts but you are no match for those haughty islanders you are too tender know thou that on the way i met one who asked me for thee under the name thou didst bear in the world be on thy guard let not the world catch thee again by any silken net and remember solitude fasting and prayer are the sword spear and shield of the soul farewell clement was deeply shocked and mortified at this contemptuous desertion and this coldblooded missive he promised the good monks to sleep at the convent and to preach wherever the prior should appoint for jerome had raised him to the skies as a preacher and then withdrew abruptly for he was cut to the quick and wanted to be alone he asked himself was there some incurable fault in him repulsive to so true a son of dominic or was jerome himself devoid of that christian love which st paul had placed above faith itself shipwrecked with him and saved on the same fragment of the wreck his pupil his penitent his son in the church and now for four hundred miles his fellowtraveller in christ and to be shaken off like dirt the first opportunity with harsh and cold disdain why worldly hearts are no colder nor less trusty than this said he the only one that ever really loved me lies in a grave hard by fly me fly to england man born without a heart i will go and pray over a grave at sevenbergen three hours later he passed peters cottage a troop of noisy children were playing about the door and the house had been repaired and a new outhouse added he turned his head hastily away not to disturb a picture his memory treasured and went to the churchyard he sought among the tombstones for margarets he could not find it he could not believe they had grudged her a tombstone so searched the churchyard all over again oh poverty stern poverty poor soul thou wert like me no one was left that loved thee when gerard was gone he went into the church and after kissing the steps prayed long and earnestly for the soul of her whose restingplace he could not find coming out of the church he saw a very old man looking over the little churchyard gate he went towards him and asked him did he live in the place four score and twelve years man and boy and i come here every day of late holy father to take a peep this is where i look to bide ere long my son can you tell me where margaret lies margaret theres a many margarets here margaret brandt she was daughter to a learned physician as if i didnt know that said the old man pettishly but she doesnt lie here bless you they left this a longful while ago gone in a moment and the house empty what is she dead margaret a peter dead now only think ont like enow like enow they great towns do terribly disagree wi country folk what great towns my son well twas rotterdam they went to from here so i heard tell or was it amsterdam nay i trow twas rotterdam and gone there to die clement sighed twas not in her face now that i saw and i can mostly tell alack there was a blooming young flower to be cut off so soon and all old weed like me left standing still well well she was a may rose yon dear heart what a winsome smile she had and god bless thee my son said clement farewell and he hurried away he reached the convent at sunset and watched and prayed in the chapel for jerome and margaret till it was long past midnight and his soul had recovered its cold calm chapter lxxxiv the hearth the next day sunday after mass was a bustling day at catherines house in the hoog straet the shop was now quite ready and cornelis and sybrandt were to open it next day their names were above the door also their sign a white lamb sucking a gilt sheep eli had come and brought them some more goods from his store to give them a good start the hearts of the parents glowed at what they were doing and the pair themselves walked in the garden together and agreed they were sick of their old life and it was more pleasant to make money than waste it they vowed to stick to business like wax their mothers quick and ever watchful ear overheard this resolution through an open window and she told eli the family supper was to include margaret and her boy and be a kind of inaugural feast at which good trade advice was to flow from the elders and good wine to be drunk to the success of the converts to commerce from agriculture in its unremunerative formwild oats so margaret had come over to help her motherinlaw and also to shake off her own deep languor and both their faces were as red as the fire presently in came joan with a salad from jorians garden he cut it for you margaret you are all his chat i shall be jealous i told him you were to feast today but oh lass what a sermon in the new kerk preaching i never heard it till this day would i had been there then said margaret for i am dried up for want of dew from heaven why he preacheth again this afternoon but mayhap you are wanted here not she said catherine come away ye go if yare minded indeed said margaret methinks i should not be such a damper at table if i could come to t warm from a good sermon then you must be brisk observed joan see the folk are wending that way and as i live there goes the holy friar oh bless us and save us margaret the hermit we forgot and this active woman bounded out of the house and ran across the road and stopped the friar she returned as quickly there i was bent on seeing him nigh hand what said he to thee says he my daughter i will go to him ere sunset god willing the sweetest voice but oh my mistresses what thin cheeks for a young man and great eyes not far from your colour margaret i have a great mind to go hear him said margaret but my cap is not very clean and they will all be there in their snowwhite mutches there take my handkerchief out of the basket said catherine you cannot have the child i want him for my poor kate it is one of her ill days margaret replied by taking the boy upstairs she found kate in bed how art thou sweetheart nay i need not ask thou art in sore pain thou smilest so see i have brought thee one thou lovest two by my way of counting said kate with an angelic smile she had a spasm at that moment would have made some of us roar like bulls what in your lap said margaret answering a gesture of the suffering girl nay he is too heavy and thou in such pain i love him too dear to feel his weight was the reply margaret took this opportunity and made her toilet i am for the kerk said she to hear a beautiful preacher kate sighed and a minute ago kate i was all agog to go that is the way with me this month past up and down up and down like the waves of the zuyder zee id as lieve stay aside thee say the word nay said kate prithee go and bring me back every word welladay that i cannot go myself and the tears stood in the patients eyes this decided margaret and she kissed kate looked under her lashes at the boy and heaved a little sigh i trow i must not said she i never could kiss him a little and my father was dead against waking a child by day or night when tis thy pleasure to wake speak thy aunt kate the two new words thou hast gotten and she went out looking lovingly over her shoulder and shut the door inaudibly joan you will lend me a hand and peel these said catherine that i will dame and the cooking proceeded with silent vigour now joan them which help me cook and serve the meat they help me eat it thats a rule theres worse laws in holland than that your will is my pleasure mistress for my luke hath got his supper i the air he is digging today by good luck margaret came down eh woman yon is an ugly trade there she has just washed her face and gien her hair a turn and now who is like her rotterdam that for you and catherine snapped her fingers at the capital give us a buss hussy now mind eli wont wait supper for the duke wherefore loiter not after your kerk is over joan and she both followed her to the door and stood at it watching her a good way down the street for among homely housewives going out o doors is half an incident catherine commented on the launch there joan it is almost to me as if i had just started my own daughter for kerk and stood a looking after the which ive done it manys and manys the times joan lass she wont hear a word against our gerard and he be alive he has used her cruel that is why my bowels yearn for the poor wench im older and wiser than she and so ill wed her to yon simple luke and there an end whats one grandchild chapter lxxxv the cloister and the hearth the sermon had begun when margaret entered the great church of st laurens it was a huge edifice far from completed churches were not built in a year the side aisles were roofed but not the mid aisle nor the chancel the pillars and arches were pretty perfect and some of them whitewashed but only one window in the whole church was glazed the rest were at present great jagged openings in the outer walls but today all these uncouth imperfections made the church beautiful it was a glorious summer afternoon and the sunshine came broken into marvellous forms through those irregular openings and played bewitching pranks upon so many broken surfaces it streamed through the gaping walls and clove the dark cool side aisles with rivers of glory and dazzled and glowed on the white pillars beyond and nearly the whole central aisle was chequered with light and shade in broken outlines the shades seeming cooler and more soothing than ever shade was and the lights like patches of amber diamond animated with heavenly fire and above from west to east the blue sky vaulted the lofty aisle and seemed quite close the sunny caps of the women made a sea of white contrasting exquisitely with that vivid vault of blue for the mid aisle huge as it was was crammed yet quite still the words and the mellow gentle earnest voice of the preacher held them mute margaret stood spellbound at the beauty the devotion the great calm she got behind a pillar in the north aisle and there though she could hardly catch a word a sweet devotional langour crept over her at the loveliness of the place and the preachers musical voice and balmy oil seemed to trickle over the waves in her heart and smooth them so she leaned against the pillar with eyes half closed and all seemed soft and dreamy she felt it good to be there presently she saw a lady leave an excellent place opposite to get out of the sun which was indeed pouring on her head from the window margaret went round softly but swiftly and was fortunate enough to get the place she was now beside a pillar of the south aisle and not above fifty feet from the preacher she was at his side a little behind him but could hear every word her attention however was soon distracted by the shadow of a mans head and shoulders bobbing up and down so drolly she had some ado to keep from smiling yet it was nothing essentially droll it was the sexton digging she found that out in a moment by looking behind her through the window to whence the shadow came now as she was looking at jorian ketel digging suddenly a tone of the preachers voice fell upon her ear and her mind so distinctly it seemed literally to strike her and make her vibrate inside and out her hand went to her bosom so strange and sudden was the thrill then she turned round and looked at the preacher his back was turned and nothing visible but his tonsure she sighed that tonsure being all she saw contradicted the tone effectually yet she now leaned a little forward with downcast eyes hoping for that accent again it did not come but the whole voice grew strangely upon her it rose and fell as the preacher warmed and it seemed to waken faint echoes of a thousand happy memories she would not look to dispel the melancholy pleasure this voice gave her presently in the middle of an eloquent period the preacher stopped she almost sighed a soothing music had ended could the sermon be ended already no she looked round the people did not move a good many faces seemed now to turn her way she looked behind her sharply there was nothing there startled countenances near her now eyed the preacher she followed their looks and there in the pulpit was a face as of a staring corpse the friars eyes naturally large and made larger by the thinness of his cheeks were dilated to supernatural size and glaring her way out of a bloodless face she cringed and turned fearfully round for she thought there must be some terrible thing near her no there was nothing she was the outside figure of the listening crowd at this moment the church fell into commotion figures got up all over the building and craned forward agitated faces by hundreds gazed from the friar to margaret and from margaret to the friar the turning to and fro of so many caps made a loud rustle then came shrieks of nervous women and buzzing of men and margaret seeing so many eyes levelled at her shrank terrified behind the pillar with one scared hurried glance at the preacher momentary as that glance was it caught in that stricken face an expression that made her shiver she turned faint and sat down on a heap of chips the workmen had left and buried her face in her hands the sermon went on again she heard the sound of it but not the sense she tried to think but her mind was in a whirl thought would fix itself in no shape but this that on that prodigystricken face she had seen a look stamped and the recollection of that look now made her quiver from head to foot for that look was recognition the sermon after wavering some time ended in a strain of exalted nay feverish eloquence that went far to make the crowd forget the preachers strange pause and ghastly glare margaret mingled hastily with the crowd and went out of the church with them they went their ways home but she turned at the door and went into the churchyard to peters grave poor as she was she had given him a slab and a headstone she sat down on the slab and kissed it then threw her apron over her head that no one might distinguish her by her hair father she said thou hast often heard me say i am wading in deep waters but now i begin to think god only knows the bottom of them ill follow that friar round the world but ill see him at arms length and he shall tell me why he looked towards me like a dead man wakened and not a soul behind me oh father you often praised me here speak a word for me there for i am wading in deep waters her fathers tomb commanded a side view of the church door and on that tomb she sat with her face covered waylaying the holy preacher chapter lxxxvi the cloister and the hearth the cool church chequered with sunbeams and crowned with heavenly purple soothed and charmed father clement as it did margaret and more it carried his mind direct to the creator of all good and pure delights then his eye fell on the great aisle crammed with his country folk a thousand snowy caps filigreed with gold many a hundred leagues he had travelled but seen nothing like them except snow in the morning he had thundered but this sweet afternoon seemed out of tune with threats his bowels yearned over that multitude and he must tell them of gods love poor souls they heard almost as little of it from the pulpit then a days as the heathen used he told them the glad tidings of salvation the people hung upon his gentle earnest tongue he was not one of those preachers who keep gyrating in the pulpit like the weathercock on the steeple he moved the hearts of others more than his own body but on the other hand he did not entirely neglect those who were in bad places and presently warm with this theme that none of all that multitude might miss the joyful tidings of christs love he turned him towards the south aisle and there in a stream of sunshine from the window was the radiant face of margaret brandt he gazed at it without emotion it just benumbed him soul and body but soon the words died in his throat and he trembled as he glared at it there with her auburn hair bathed in sunbeams and glittering like the gloriola of a saint and her face glowing doubly with its own beauty and the sunshine it was set instood his dead love she was leaning very lightly against a white column she was listening with tender downcast lashes he had seen her listen so to him a hundred times there was no change in her this was the blooming margaret he had left only a shade riper and more lovely he started at her with monstrous eyes and bloodless cheeks the people died out of his sight he heard as in a dream a rustling and rising all over the church but could not take his prodigystricken eyes off that face all life and bloom and beauty and that wondrous auburn hair glistening gloriously in the sun he gazed thinking she must vanish she remained all in a moment she was looking at him full her own violet eyes at this he was beside himself and his lips parted to shriek out her name when she turned her head swiftly and soon after vanished but not without one more glance which though rapid as lightning encountered his and left her couching and quivering with her mind in a whirl and him panting and gripping the pulpit convulsively for this glance of hers though not recognition was the startled inquiring nameless indescribable look that precedes recognition he made a mighty effort and muttered something nobody could understand then feebly resumed his discourse and stammered and babbled on a while till by degrees forcing himself now she was out of sight to look on it as a vision from the other world he rose into a state of unnatural excitement and concluded in a style of eloquence that electrified the simple for it bordered on rhapsody the sermon ended he sat down on the pulpit stool terribly shaken but presently an idea very characteristic of the time took possession of him he had sought her grave at sevenbergen in vain she had now been permitted to appear to him and show him that she was buried here probably hard by that very pillar where her spirit had showed itself to him this idea once adopted soon settled on his mind with all the certainty of a fact and he felt he had only to speak to the sexton whom to his great disgust he had seen working during the sermon to learn the spot where she was laid the church was now quite empty he came down from the pulpit and stepped through an aperture in the south wall on to the grass and went up to the sexton he knew him in a moment but jorian never suspected the poor lad whose life he had saved in this holy friar the loss of his shapely beard had wonderfully altered the outline of his face this had changed him even more than his tonsure his short hair sprinkled with premature grey and his cheeks thinned and paled by fasts and vigils my son said friar clement softly if you keep any memory of those whom you lay in the earth prithee tell me is any christian buried inside the church near one of the pillars nay father said jorian here in the churchyard lie buried all that buried be why no matter prithee tell me then where lieth margaret brandt margaret brandt and jorian stared stupidly at the speaker she died about three years ago and was buried here oh that is another matter said jorian that was before my time the vicar could tell you likely if so be she was a gentlewoman or at the least rich enough to pay him his fee alas my son she was poor and paid a heavy penalty for it but born of decent folk her father peter was a learned physician she came hither from sevenbergento die when clement had uttered these words his head sunk upon his breast and he seemed to have no power nor wish to question jorian more i doubt even if he knew where he was he was lost in the past jorian put down his spade and standing upright in the grave set his arms akimbo and said sulkily are you making a fool of me holy sir or has some wag been making a fool of you and having relieved his mind thus he proceeded to dig again with a certain vigour that showed his somewhat irritable temper was ruffled clement gazed at him with a puzzled but gently reproachful eye for the tone was rude and the words unintelligible goodnatured though crusty jorian had not thrown up three spadefuls ere he became ashamed of it himself why what a base churl am i to speak thus to thee holy father and thou a standing there looking at me like a lamb aha i have it tis peter brandts grave you would fain see not margarets he does lie here hard by the west door there ill show you and he laid down his spade and put on his doublet and jerkin to go with the friar he did not know there was anybody sitting on peters tomb still less that she was watching for this holy friar pietro vanucci and andrea did not recognize him without his beard the fact is that the beard which has never known a razor grows in a very picturesque and characteristic form and becomes a feature in the face so that its removal may in some cases be an effectual disguise chapter lxxxvii while jorian was putting on his doublet and jerkin to go to peters tomb his tongue was not idle they used to call him a magician out sevenbergen way and they do say he gave em a touch of his trade at parting told em he saw margarets lad acoming down rhine in brave clothes and store o money but his face scarred by foreign glaive and not altogether so many arms and legs as a went away wi but dear heart nought came ont margaret is still wearying for her lad and peter he lies as quiet as his neighbours not but what she hath put a stone slab over him to keep him where he is as you shall see he put both hands on the edge of the grave and was about to raise himself out of it but the friar laid a trembling hand on his shoulder and said in a strange whisper how long since died peter brandt about two months why and his daughter buried him say you nay i buried him but she paid the fee and reared the stone thenbut he had just one daughter margaret no more leastways that he owned to then you think margaret isis alive think why i should be dead else riddle me that alas how can i you love her no more than reason being a married man and father of four more sturdy knaves like myself nay the answer is she saved my life scarce six weeks agone now had she been dead she couldnt ha kept me alive bless your heart i couldnt keep a thing on my stomach nor doctors couldnt make me my joan says tis time to buy thee a shroud i dare say so tis says i but try and borrow one first in comes my lady this margaret which she died three years ago by your way ont opens the windows makes em shift me where i lay and cures me in the twinkling of a bedpost but wi what there pinches the shoe with the scurviest herb and out of my own garden too with sweet feverfew a herb quotha tis a weed leastways it was a weed till it cured me but now wheneer i pass my hunch i doff bonnet and says i fly service tye why how now father you look wondrous pale and now you are red and now you are white why what is the matter what in heavens name is the matter the surprisethe joythe wonderthe fear gasped clement why what is it to thee art thou of kin to margaret brandt nay but i knew one that loved her well so well her death nigh killed him body and soul and yet thou sayest she lives and i believe thee jorian stared and after a considerable silence said very gravely father you have asked me many questions and i have answered them truly now for our ladys sake answer me but two did you in very sooth know one who loved this poor lass where clement was on the point of revealing himself but he remembered jeromes letter and shrank from being called by the name he had borne in the world i knew him in italy said he if you knew him you can tell me his name said jorian cautiously his name was gerard eliassoen oh but this is strange stay what made thee say margaret brandt was dead i was with gerard when a letter came from margaret van eyck the letter told him she he loved was dead and buried let me sit down for my strength fails me foul play foul play father said jorian i thank heaven for sending thee to me ay sit ye down ye do look like a ghost ye fast overmuch to be strong my mind misgives me methinks i hold the clue to this riddle and if i do there be two knaves in this town whose heads i would fain batter to pieces as i do this mould and he clenched his teeth and raised his long spade above his head and brought it furiously down upon the heap several times foul play you never said a truer word i your life and if you know where gerard is now lose no time but show him the trap they have laid for him mine is but a dull head but whiles the slow hound puzzles out the scentgo to and i do think you and i ha got hold of two ends o one stick and a main foul one jorian then after some of those useless preliminaries men of his class always deal in came to the point of the story he had been employed by the burgomaster of tergou to repair the floor of an upper room in his house and when it was almost done coming suddenly to fetch away his tools curiosity had been excited by some loud words below and he had lain down on his stomach and heard the burgomaster talking about a letter which cornelis and sybrandt were minded to convey into the place of one that a certain hans memling was taking to gerard and it seems their will was good but their stomach was small so to give them courage the old man showed them a drawer full of silver and if they did the trick they should each put a hand in and have all the silver they could hold int well father continued jorian i thought not much ont at the time except for the bargain itself that kept me awake mostly all night think ont next morning at peep of day who should i see but my masters cornelis and sybrandt come out of their house each with a black eye oho says i what yon hans hath put his mark on ye well now i hope that is all you have got for your pains didnt they make for the burgomasters house i to my hidingplace at this part of jorians revelation the monks nostril dilated and his restless eye showed the suspense he was in well father continued jorian the burgomaster brought them into that same room he had a letter in his hand but i am no scholar however i have got as many eyes in my head as the pope hath and i saw the drawer opened and those two knaves put in each a hand and draw it out full and saints in glory how they tried to hold more and more and more o yon stuff and sybrandt he had daubed his hand in something sticky i think twas glue and he made shift to carry one or two pieces away a sticking to the back of his hand he he he tis a sin to laugh so you see luck was on the wrong side as usual they had done the trick but how they did it that methinks will never be known till doomsday go to they left their immortal jewels in yon drawer well they got a handful of silver for them the devil had the worst o yon bargain there father that is off my mind often i longed to tell it some one but i durst not to the women or margaret would not have had a friend left in the world for those two blackhearted villains are the favourites tis always so have not the old folk just taken a brave new shop for them in this very town in the hoog straet there may you see their sign a gilt sheep and a lambkin a brace of wolves sucking their dam would be nigher the mark and there the whole family feast this day oh tis a fine world what not a word holy father you sit there like stone and have not even a curse to bestow on them the stonyhearted miscreants what was it not enough the poor lad was all alone in a strange land must his own flesh and blood go and lie away the one blessing his enemies had left him and then think of her pining and pining all these years and sitting at the window looking adown the street for gerard and so constant so tender and true my wife says she is sure no woman ever loved a man truer than she loves the lad those villains have parted from her and the day never passes but she weeps salt tears for him and when i think that but for those two greedy lying knaves yon winsome lad whose life i saved might be by her side this day the happiest he in holland and the sweet lass that saved my life might be sitting with her cheek upon her sweethearts shoulder the happiest she in holland in place of the saddest oh i thirst for their blood the nasty sneaking lying cogging cowardly heartless bowellesshow now the monk started wildly up livid with fury and despair and rushed headlong from the place with both hands clenched and raised on high so terrible was this inarticulate burst of fury that jorians puny ire died out at sight of it and he stood looking dismayed after the human tempest he had launched while thus absorbed he felt his arm grasped by a small tremulous hand it was margaret brandt he started her coming there just then seemed so strange she had waited long on peters tombstone but the friar did not come so she went into the church to see if he was there still she could not find him presently going up the south aisle the gigantic shadow of a friar came rapidly along the floor and part of a pillar and seemed to pass through her she was near screaming but in a moment remembered jorians shadow had come in so from the churchyard and tried to clamber out the nearest way she did so but with some difficulty and by that time clement was just disappearing down the street yet so expressive at times is the body as well as the face she could see he was greatly agitated jorian and she looked at one another and at the wild figure of the distant friar well said she to jorian trembling well said he you startled me how come you here of all people is this a time for idle chat what said he to you he has been speaking to you deny it not girl as i stand here he asked me whereabout you were buried in this churchyard ah i told him nowhere thank heaven you were alive and saving other folk from the churchyard well well the long and the short is he knew thy gerard in italy and a letter came saying you were dead and it broke thy poor lads heart let me see who was the letter written by oh by the demoiselle van eyck that was his way of it but i up and told him nay twas neither demoiselle nor dame that penned yon lie but ghysbrecht van swieten and those foul knaves cornelis and sybrandt these changed the true letter for one of their own i told him as how i saw the whole villainy done through a chink and now if i have not been and told you oh cruel cruel but he lives the fear of fears is gone thank god ay lass and as for thine enemies i have given them a dig for yon friar is friendly to gerard and he is gone to elis house methinks for i told him where to find gerards enemies and thine and wow but he will give them their lesson if ever a man was mad with rage its yon he turned black and white and parted like a stone from a sling girl there was thunder in his eye and silence on his lips made me cold a did oh jorian what have you done cried margaret quick quick help me thither for the power is gone all out of my body you know him not as i do oh if you had seen the blow he gave ghysbrecht and heard the frightful crash come save him from worse mischief the water is deep enow but not bloody yet come her accents were so full of agony that jorian sprang out of the grave and came with her huddling on his jerkin as he went but as they hurried along he asked her what on earth she meant i talk of this friar and you answer me of gerard man see you not this is gerard this gerard what mean ye i mean yon friar is my boys father i have waited for him long jorian well he is come to me at last and thank god for it oh my poor child quicker jorian quicker why thou art mad as he stay by st bavon yon was gerards face twas nought like it yet somehowtwas it come on come on let me see the end of this the end how many of us will live to see that they hurried along in breathless silence till they reached hoog straet then jorian tried to reassure her you are making your own trouble said he who says he has gone thither more likely to the convent to weep and pray poor soul oh cursed cursed villains did not you tell him where those villains bide ay that i did then quicker oh jorian quicker i see the house thank god and all the saints i shall be in time to calm him i know what ill say to him heaven forgive me poor catherine tis of her i think she has been a mother to me the shop was a corner house with two doors one in the main street for customers and a housedoor round the corner margaret and jorian were now within twenty yards of the shop when they heard a roar inside like as of some wild animal and the friar burst out white and raging and went tearing down the street margaret screamed and sank fainting on jorians arm jorian shouted after him stay madman know thy friends but he was deaf and went headlong shaking his clenched fists high high in the air help me in good jorian moaned margaret turning suddenly calm let me know the worst and die he supported her trembling limbs into the house it seemed unnaturally still not a sound jorians own heart beat fast a door was before him unlatched he pushed it softly with his left hand and margaret and he stood on the threshold what they saw there you shall soon know chapter lxxxviii it was suppertime elis family were collected round the board margaret only was missing to catherines surprise eli said he would wait a bit for her why i told her you would not wait for the duke she is not the duke she is a poor good lass that hath waited not minutes but years for a graceless son of mine you can put the meat on the board all the same then we can fall to without farther loss o time when she does come the smoking dishes smelt so savoury that eli gave way she will come if we begin said he they always do come sit ye down mistress joan yare not here for a slave i trow but a guest there i hear a quick step off covers and fall to the covers were withdrawn and the knives brandished then burst into the room not the expected margaret but a dominican friar livid with rage he was at the table in a moment in front of cornelis and sybrandt threw his tall body over the narrow table and with two hands hovering above their shrinking heads like eagles over a quarry he cursed them by name soul and body in this world and the next it was an age eloquent in curses and this curse was so full so minute so blighting blasting withering and tremendous that i am afraid to put all the words on paper cursed be the lips he shrieked which spoke the lie that margaret was dead may they rot before the grave and kiss whitehot iron in hell thereafter doubly cursed be the hands that changed those letters and be they struck off by the hangmans knife and handle hell fire for ever thrice accursed be the cruel hearts that did conceive that damned lie to part true love for ever may they sicken and wither on earth joyless loveless hopeless and wither to dust before their time and burn in eternal fire he cursed the meat at their mouths and every atom of their bodies from their hair to the soles of their feet then turning from the cowering shuddering pair who had almost hid themselves beneath the table he tore a letter out of his bosom and flung it down before his father read that thou hard old man that didst imprison thy son read and see what monsters thou hast brought into the world the memory of my wrongs and hers dwell with you all for ever i will meet you again at the judgment day on earth ye will never see me more and in a moment as he had come so he was gone leaving them stiff and cold and white as statues round the smoking board and this was the sight that greeted margarets eyes and jorianspale figures of men and women petrified around the untasted food as eastern poets feigned margaret glanced her eye round and gasped out oh joy all here no blood hath been shed oh you cruel cruel men i thank god he hath not slain you at sight of her catherine gave an eloquent scream then turned her head away but eli who had just cast his eye over the false letter and begun to understand it all seeing the other victim come in at that very moment with her wrongs reflected in her sweet pale face started to his feet in a transport of rage and shouted stand clear and let me get at the traitors ill hang for them and in a moment he whipped out his short sword and fell upon them fly screamed margaret fly they slipped howling under the table and crawled out the other side but ere they could get to the door the furious old man ran round and intercepted them catherine only screamed and wrung her hands your notables are generally useless at such a time and blood would certainly have flowed but margaret and jorian seized the fiery old mans arms and held them with all their might whilst the pair got clear of the house then they let him go and he went vainly raging after them out into the street they were a furlong off running like hares he hacked down the board on which their names were written and brought it indoors and flung it into the chimneyplace catherine was sitting rocking herself with her apron over her head joan had run to her husband margaret had her arms round catherines neck and pale and panting was yet making efforts to comfort her but it was not to be done oh my poor children she cried oh miserable mother tis a mercy kate was ill upstairs there i have lived to thank god for that she cried with a fresh burst of sobs it would have killed her he had better have stayed in italy as come home to curse his own flesh and blood and set us all by the ears oh hold your chat woman cried eli angrily you are still on the side of the illdoer you are cheap served your weakness made the rogues what they are i was for correcting them in their youth for sore ills sharp remedies but you still sided with their faults and undermined me and baffled wise severity and you margaret leave comforting her that ought rather to comfort you for what is her hurt to yours but she never had a grain of justice under her skin and never will so come thou to me that am thy father from this hour this was a command so she kissed catherine and went tottering to him and he put her on a chair beside him and she laid her feeble head on his honest breast but not a tear it was too deep for that poor lamb said he after a whilecome good folks said true eli in a broken voice to jorian and joan we are in a little trouble as you see but that is no reason you should starve for our ladys sake fall to and add not to my grief the reputation of a churl what the dickens added he with a sudden ghastly attempt at stoutheartedness the more knaves i have the luck to get shut of the more my need of true men and women to help me clear the dish and cheer mine eye with honest faces about me where else were gaps fall to i do entreat ye catherine sobbing backed his request poor simple antique hospitable souls jorian whose appetite especially since his illness was very keen was for acting on this hospitable invitation but joan whispered a word in his ear and he instantly drew back nay ill touch no meat that holy church hath cursed in sooth i forgot said eli apologetically my son who was reared at my table hath cursed my victuals that seems strange well what god wills man must bow to the supper was flung out into the yard jorian took his wife home and heavy sadness reigned in elis house that night meantime where was clement lying at full length upon the floor of the convent church with his lips upon the lowest step of the altar in an indescribable state of terror misery penitence and selfabasement through all which struggled gleams of joy that margaret was alive night fell and found him lying there weeping and praying and morning would have found him there too but he suddenly remembered that absorbed in his own wrongs and margarets he had committed another sin besides intemperate rage he had neglected a dying man he rose instantly groaning at his accumulated wickedness and set out to repair the omission the weather had changed it was raining hard and when he got clear of the town he heard the wolves baying they were on the foot but clement was himself again or nearly he thought little of danger or discomfort having a shameful omission of religious duty to repair he went stoutly forward through rain and darkness and as he went he often beat his breast and cried mea culpa mea culpa chapter lxxxix what that sensitive mind and tender conscience and loving heart and religious soul went through even in a few hours under a situation so sudden and tremendous is perhaps beyond the power of words to paint fancy yourself the man and then put yourself in his place were i to write a volume on it we should have to come to that at last i shall relate his next two overt acts they indicate his state of mind after the first fierce tempest of the soul had subsided after spending the night with the dying hermit in giving and receiving holy consolations he set out not for rotterdam but for tergou he went there to confront his fatal enemy the burgomaster and by means of that parchment whose history bytheby was itself a romance to make him disgorge and give margaret her own heated and dusty he stopped at the fountain and there began to eat his black bread and drink of the water but in the middle of his frugal meal a female servant came running and begged him to come and shrive her dying master he returned the bread to his wallet and followed her without a word she took himto the stadthouse he drew back with a little shudder when he saw her go in but he almost instantly recovered himself and followed her into the house and up the stairs and there in bed propped up by pillows lay his deadly enemy looking already like a corpse clement eyed him a moment from the door and thought of all the tower the wood the letter then he said in a low voice pax vobiscum he trembled a little while he said it the sick man welcomed him as eagerly as his weak state permitted thank heaven thou art come in time to absolve me from my sins father and pray for my soul thou and thy brethren my son said clement before absolution cometh confession in which act there must be no reservation as thou valuest thy souls weal bethink thee therefore wherein thou hast most offended god and the church while i offer up a prayer for wisdom to direct thee clement then kneeled and prayed and when he rose from his knees he said to ghysbrecht with apparent calmness my son confess thy sins ah father said the sick man they are many and great great then be thy penitence my son so shalt thou find gods mercy great ghysbrecht put his hands together and began to confess with every appearance of contrition he owned he had eaten meat in midlent he had often absented himself from mass on the lords day and saints days and had trifled with other religious observances which he enumerated with scrupulous fidelity when he had done the friar said quietly tis well my son these be faults now to thy crimes thou hadst done better to begin with them why father what crimes lie to my account if these be none am i confessing to thee or thou to me said clement somewhat severely forgive me father why surely i to you but i know not what you call crimes the seven deadly sins art thou clear of them heaven forefend i should be guilty of them i know them not by name many do them all that cannot name them begin with that one which leads to lying theft and murder i am quit of that one any way how call you it avarice my son avarice oh as to that i have been a saving man all my day but i have kept a good table and not altogether forgotten the poor but alas i am a great sinner mayhap the next will catch me what is the next we have not yet done with this one bethink thee the church is not to be trifled with alas am i in a condition to trifle with her now avarice avarice he looked puzzled and innocent hast thou ever robbed the fatherless inquired the friar me robbed the fatherless gasped ghysbrecht not that i mind once more my son i am forced to tell thee thou art trifling with the church miserable man another evasion and i leave thee and fiends will straightway gather round thy bed and tear thee down to the bottomless pit oh leave me not leave me not shrieked the terrified old man the church knows all i must have robbed the fatherless i will confess who shall i begin with my memory for names is shaken the defence was skilful but in this case failed hast thou forgotten floris brandt said clement stonily the sick man reared himself in bed in a pitiable state of terror how knew you that said he the church knows many things said clement coldly and by many ways that are dark to thee miserable impenitent you called her to your side hoping to deceive her you said i will not confess to the cure but to some friar who knows not my misdeeds so will i cheat the church on my deathbed and die as i have lived but god kinder to thee than thou art to thyself sent to thee one whom thou couldst not deceive he has tried thee he was patient with thee and warned thee not to trifle with holy church but all is in vain thou canst not confess for thou art impenitent as a stone die then as thou hast lived methinks i see the fiends crowding round the bed for their prey they wait but for me to go and i go he turned his back but ghysbrecht in extremity of terror caught him by the frock oh holy man mercy stay i will confess all all i robbed my friend floris alas would it had ended there for he lost little by me but i kept the land from peter his son and from margaret peters daughter yet i was always going to give it back but i couldnt i couldnt avarice my son avarice happy for thee tis not too late no i will leave it her by will she will not have long to wait for it now not above a month or two at farthest for which months possession thou wouldst damn thy soul for ever thou fool the sick man groaned and prayed the friar to be reasonable the friar firmly but gently and persuasively persisted and with infinite patience detached the dying mans gripe from anothers property there were times when his patience was tried and he was on the point of thrusting his hand into his bosom and producing the deed which he had brought for that purpose but after yesterdays outbreak he was on his guard against choler and to conclude he conquered his impatience he conquered a personal repugnance to the man so strong as to make his own flesh creep all the time he was struggling with this miser for his soul and at last without a word about the deed he won upon him to make full and prompt restitution how the restitution was made will be briefly related elsewhere also certain curious effects produced upon ghysbrecht by it and when and on what terms ghysbrecht and clement parted i promised to relate two acts of the latter indicative of his mind this is one the other is told in two words as soon as he was quite sure margaret had her own and was a rich woman he disappeared chapter xc it was the day after that terrible scene the little house in the hoog straet was like a grave and none more listless and dejected than catherine so busy and sprightly by nature after dinner her eyes red with weeping she went to the convent to try and soften gerard and lay the first stone at least of a reconciliation it was some time before she could make the porter understand whom she was seeking eventually she learned he had left late last night and was not expected back she went sighing with the news to margaret she found her sitting idle like one with whom life had lost its savour she had her boy clasped so tight in her arms as if he was all she had left and she feared some one would take him too catherine begged her to come to the hoog straet what for sighed margaret you cannot but say to yourselves she is the cause of all nay nay said catherine we are not so illhearted and eli is so fond on you you will maybe soften him oh if you think i can do any good ill come said margaret with a weary sigh they found eli and a carpenter putting up another name in place of cornelis and sybrandts and what should that name be but margaret brandts with all her affection for margaret this went through poor catherine like a knife the bane of one is anothers meat said she can he make me spend the money unjustly replied margaret coldly you are a good soul said catherine ay so best sith he is the strongest the next day giles dropped in and catherine told the story all in favour of the black sheep and invited his pity for them anathematized by their brother and turned on the wide world by their father but giless prejudices ran the other way he heard her out and told her bluntly the knaves had got off cheap they deserved to be hanged at margarets door into the bargain and dismissing them with contempt crowed with delight at the return of his favourite ill show him said he what tis to have a brother at court with a heart to serve a friend and a head to point the way bless thee giles murmured margaret softly thou wast ever his stanch friend dear giles said little kate but alack i know not what thou canst do for him now giles had left them and all was sad and silent again when a welldressed man opened the door softly and asked was margaret brandt here dye hear lass you are wanted said catherine briskly in her the gossip was indestructible well mother said margaret listlessly and here i am a shuffling of feet was heard at the door and a colourless feeble old man was assisted into the room it was ghysbrecht van swieten at sight of him catherine shrieked and threw her apron over her head and margaret shuddered violently and turned her head swiftly away not to see him a feeble voice issued from the strange visitors lips good people a dying man hath come to ask your forgiveness come to look on your work you mean said catherine taking down her apron and bursting out sobbing there there she is fainting look to her eli quick nay said margaret in a feeble voice the sight of him gave me a turn that is all prithee let him say his say and go for he is the murderer of me and mine alas said ghysbrecht i am too feeble to say it standing and no one biddeth me sit down eli who had followed him into the house interfered here and said half sullenly half apologetically well burgomaster tis not our wont to leave a visitor standing whiles we sit but man man you have wrought us too much ill and the honest fellows voice began to shake with anger he fought hard to contain because it was his own house then ghysbrecht found an advocate in one who seldom spoke in vain in that family it was little kate father mother said she my duty to you but this is not well death squares all accounts and see you not death in his face i shall not live long good friends and his time is shorter than mine eli made haste and set a chair for their dying enemy with his own hands ghysbrechts attendants put him into it go fetch the boxes said he they brought in two boxes and then retired leaving their master alone in the family he had so cruelly injured every eye was now bent on him except margarets he undid the boxes with unsteady fingers and brought out of one the titledeeds of a property at tergou this land and these houses belonged to floris brandt and do belong to thee of right his granddaughter these i did usurp for a debt long since defrayed with interest these i now restore their rightful owner with penitent tears in this other box are three hundred and forty golden angels being the rent and fines i have received from that land more than floris brandts debt to me i have kept it compt still meaning to be just one day but avarice withheld me pray good people against temptation i was not born dishonest yet you see well to be sure cried catherine and you the burgomaster hast whipt good store of thieves in thy day however said she on second thoughts tis better late than never what margaret art deaf the good man hath brought thee back thine own art a rich woman alack what a mountain o gold bid him keep land and gold and give me back my gerard that he stole from me with his treason said margaret with her head still averted alas said ghysbrecht would i could what i can i have done is it nought it cost me a sore struggle and i rose from my last bed to do it myself lest some mischance should come between her and her rights old man said margaret since thou whose idol is pelf hast done this god and the saints will as i hope forgive thee as for me i am neither saint nor angel but only a poor woman whose heart thou hast broken speak to him kate for i am like the dead kate meditated a little while and then her soft silvery voice fell like a soothing melody upon the air my poor sister hath a sorrow that riches cannot heal give her time ghysbrecht tis not in nature she should forgive thee all her boy is fatherless and she is neither maid wife nor widow and the blow fell but two days syne that laid her heart a bleeding a single heavy sob from margaret was the comment to these words therefore give her time and ere thou diest she will forgive thee all ay even to pleasure me that haply shall not be long behind thee ghysbrecht meantime we whose wounds be sore but not so deep as hers do pardon thee a penitent and a dying man and i for one will pray for thee from this hour go in peace their little oracle had spoken it was enough eli even invited him to break a manchet and drink a stoup of wine to give him heart for his journey but ghysbrecht declined and said what he had done was a cordial to him man seeth but a little way before him neighbour this land i clung so to it was a bed of nettles to me all the time tis gone and i feel happier and livelier like for the loss ont he called his men and they lifted him into the litter when he was gone catherine gloated over the money she had never seen so much together and was almost angry with margaret for sitting out there like an image and she dilated on the advantages of money and she teased margaret till at last she prevailed on her to come and look at it better let her be mother said kate how can she relish gold with a heart in her bosom liker lead but catherine persisted the result was margaret looked down at all her wealth with wondering eyes then suddenly wrung her hands and cried with piercing anguish too late too late and shook off her leaden despondency only to go into strong hysterics over the wealth that came too late to be shared with him she loved a little of this gold a portion of this land a year or two ago when it was as much her own as now and gerard would have never left her side for italy or any other place too late too late chapter xci not many days after this came the news that margaret van eyck was dead and buried by a will she had made a year before she left all her property after her funeral expenses and certain presents to reicht heynes to her dear daughter margaret brandt requesting her to keep reicht as long as unmarried by this will margaret inherited a furnished house and pictures and sketches that in the present day would be a fortune among the pictures was one she valued more than a gallery of others it represented a betrothal the solemnity of the ceremony was marked in the grave face of the man and the demure complacency of the woman she was painted almost entirely by margaret van eyck but the rest of the picture by jan the accessories were exquisitely finished and remain a marvel of skill to this day margaret brandt sent word to reicht to stay in the house till such time as she could find the heart to put foot in it and miss the face and voice that used to meet her there and to take special care of the picture in the little cubboord meaning the diptych the next thing was luke peterson came home and heard that gerard was a monk he was like to go mad with joy he came to margaret and saidheed mistress if he cannot marry you i can you said margaret why i have seen him but he is a friar he was my husband and my boys father long ere he was a friar and i have seen him ive seen him luke was thoroughly puzzled ill tell you what said he i have got a cousin a lawyer ill go and ask him whether you are married or single nay i shall ask my own heart not a lawyer so that is your regard for me to go making me the town talk oh fie that is done already without a word from me but not by such as seek my respect and if you do it never come nigh me again ay said luke with a sigh you are like a dove to all the rest but you are a hardhearted tyrant to me tis your own fault dear luke for wooing me that is what lets me from being as kind to you as i desire luke my bonny lad listen to me i am rich now i can make my friends happy though not myself look round the street look round the parish there is many a quean in it fairer than i twice told and not spoiled with weeping look high and take your choice speak you to the lass herself and ill speak to the mother they shall not say thee nay take my word fort i see what ye mean said luke turning very red but if i cant have your liking i will none o your money i was your servant when you were poor as i and poorer no if you would liever be a friars leman than an honest mans wife you are not the woman i took you for so part we withouten malice seek you your comfort on yon road where never a she did find it yet and for me ill live and die a bachelor good even mistress farewell dear luke and god forgive you for saying that to me for some days margaret dreaded almost as much as she desired the coming interview with gerard she said to herself i wonder not he keeps away a while for so should i however he would hear he was a father and the desire to see their boy would overcome everything and said the poor girl to herself if so be that meeting does not kill me i feel i shall be better after it than i am now but when day after day went by and he was not heard of a freezing suspicion began to crawl and creep towards her mind what if his absence was intentional what if he had gone to some coldblooded monks his fellows and they had told him never to see her more the convent had ere this shown itself as merciless to true lovers as the grave itself at this thought the very life seemed to die out of her and now for the first time deep indignation mingled at times with her grief and apprehension can he have ever loved me to run from me and his boy without a word why this poor luke thinks more of me than he does while her mind was in this state giles came roaring ive hit the clout our gerard is vicar of gouda a very brief sketch of the dwarfs court life will suffice to prepare the reader for his own account of this feat some months before he went to court his intelligence had budded he himself dated the change from a certain th of june when swinging by one hand along with the weeks washing on a tight rope in the drying ground something went crack inside his head and lo intellectual powers unchained at court his shrewdness and bluntness of speech coupled with his gigantic voice and his small stature made him a power without the last item i fear they would have conducted him to that unpopular gymnasium the gallows the young duchess of burgundy and marie the heiress apparent both petted him as great ladies have petted dwarfs in all ages and the court poet melted butter by the sixfoot rule and poured enough of it down his back to stew goliah in he even amplified versified and enfeebled certain rough and ready sentences dictated by giles the centipedal prolixity that resulted went to eli by letter thus entitled the high and puissant princess marie of bourgogne her lytel jantilman hys complaynt of y coort and praise of a rusticall lyfe versificated and empapyred by me the lytel jantilmans right lovynge and obsequious servitor etc but the dwarf reached his climax by a happy mixture of mind and muscle thus the day before a grand court joust he challenged the dukes giant to a trial of strength this challenge made the gravest grin and aroused expectation giles had a lofty pole planted ready and at the appointed hour went up it like a squirrel and by strength of arm made a right angle with his body and so remained then slid down so quickly that the high and puissant princess squeaked and hid her face in her hands not to see the demise of her pockethercules the giant effected only about ten feet then looked ruefully up and ruefully down and descended bathed in perspiration to argue the matter it was not the dwarfs greater strength but his smaller body the spectators received this excuse with loud derision there was the fact the dwarf was great at mounting a pole the giant only great at excuses in short giles had gauged their intellects with his own body no doubt come said he an ye go to that ill wrestle ye my lad if so be you will let me blindfold your eyne the giant smarting under defeat and thinking he could surely recover it by this means readily consented madam said giles see you yon blind samson at a signal from me he shall make me a low obeisance and unbonnet to me how may that be being blinded inquired a maid of honour ill wager on giles for one said the princess that is my affair when several wagers were laid pro and con giles hit the giant in the breadbasket he went double the obeisance and his bonnet fell off the company yelled with delight at this delicate stroke of wit and giles took to his heels the giant followed as soon as he could recover his breath and tear off his bandage but it was too late giles had prepared a little door in the wall through which he could pass but not a giant and had coloured it so artfully it looked like a wall this door he tore open and went headlong through leaving no vestige but this posy written very large upon the reverse of his trick door long limbs big body panting wit by wee and wise is bet and bit after this giles became a force he shall now speak for himself finding margaret unable to believe the good news and sceptical as to the affairs of holy church being administered by dwarfs he narrated as follows when the princess sent for me to her bedroom as of custom to keep her out of languor i came not mirthful nor full of country dicts as is my wont but dull as lead why what aileth thee quo she art sick at heart quo i alas he is in love quo she whereat five brazen hussies which they call them maids of honour did giggle loud not so mad as that said i seeing what i see at court of women folk there ladies quo the princess best let him a be tis a liberal mannikin and still giveth more than he taketh of saucy words in all sadness quo she what is the matter i told her i was meditating and what perplexed me was that other folk could now and then keep their word but princes never heyday says she thy shafts fly high this morn i told her ay for they hit the truth she said i was as keen as keen but it became not me to put riddles to her nor her to answer them stand aloof a bit mesdames said she and thou speak withouten fear for she saw i was in sad earnest i began to quake a bit for mind ye she can doff freedom and don dignity quicker than she can slip out of her dressinggown into kirtle of state but i made my voice so soft as honey wherefore smilest and i said madam one evening a matter of five years agone as ye sat with your mother the countess of charolois who is now in heaven worse luck you wi your lute and she wi her tapestry or the like do ye mind there came came into ye a fair youth with a letter from a painter body one margaret van eyck she said she thought she did was it not a tall youth exceeding comely ay madam said i he was my brother your brother said she and did eye me like all over what dost smile at so i told her all that passed between her and gerard and how she was for giving him a bishopric but the good countess said gently marie he is too young and with that they did both promise him a living yet said i he hath been a priest a long while and no living hence my bile alas said she tis not by my good will for all this thou hast said is sooth and more i do remember my dear mother said to me see thou to it if i be not here so then she cried out ay dear mother no word of thine shall ever fall to the ground i seeing her so ripe said quickly madam the vicar of gouda died last week for when ye seek favours of the great behoves ye know the very thing ye aim at then thy brother is vicar of gouda quo she so sure as i am heiress of burgundy and the netherlands nay thank me not good giles quo she but my good mother and i do thank thee for giving of me somewhat to do for her memory and doesnt she fall a weeping for her mother and doesnt that set me off asnivelling for my good brother that i love so dear and to think that a poor little elf like me could yet speak in the ear of princes and make my beautiful brother vicar of gouda eh lass it is a bonny place and a bonny manse and hawthorn in every bush at springtide and dogroses and eglantine in every summer hedge i know what the poor fool affects leave that to me the dwarf began his narrative strutting to and fro before margaret but he ended it in her arms for she could not contain herself but caught him and embraced him warmly oh giles she said blushing and kissing him i cannot keep my hands off thee thy body it is so little and thy heart so great thou art his true friend bless thee bless thee bless thee now we shall see him again we have not set eyes on him since that terrible day gramercy but that is strange said giles maybe he is ashamed of having cursed those two vagabones being our own flesh and blood worse luck think you that is why he hides said margaret eagerly ay if he is hiding at all however ill cry him by bellman nay that might much offend him what care i is gouda to go vicarless and the manse in nettles and to margarets secret satisfaction giles had the new vicar cried in rotterdam and the neighbouring towns he easily persuaded margaret that in a day or two gerard would be sure to hear and come to his benefice she went to look at his manse and thought how comfortable it might be made for him and how dearly she should love to do it but the days rolled on and gerard came neither to rotterdam nor gouda giles was mortified margaret indignant and very wretched she said to herself thinking me dead he comes home and now because i am alive he goes back to italy for that is where he has gone joan advised her to consult the hermit of gouda why sure he is dead by this time yon one belike but the cave is never long void gouda neer wants a hermit but margaret declined to go again to gouda on such an errand what can he know shut up in a cave less than i belike gerard hath gone back t italy he hates me for not being dead presently a tergovian came in with a word from catherine that ghysbrecht van swieten had seen gerard later than any one else on this margaret determined to go and see the house and goods that had been left her and take reicht heynes home to rotterdam and as may be supposed her steps took her first to ghysbrechts house she found him in his garden seated in a chair with wheels he greeted her with a feeble voice but cordially and when she asked him whether it was true he had seen gerard since the fifth of august he replied gerard no more but friar clement ay i saw him and blessed be the day he entered my house he then related in his own words his interview with clement he told her moreover that the friar had afterwards acknowledged he came to tergou with the missing deed in his bosom on purpose to make him disgorge her land but that finding him disposed towards penitence he had gone to work the other way was not this a saint who came to right thee but must needs save his enemys soul in the doing it to her question whether he had recognized him he said i neer suspected such a thing twas only when he had been three days with me that he revealed himself listen while i speak my shame and his praise i said to him the land is gone home and my stomach feels lighter but there is another fault that clingeth to me still then told i him of the letter i had writ at request of his brethren i whose place it was to check them said i yon letter was writ to part two lovers and the devil aiding it hath done the foul work land and houses i can give back but yon mischief is done for ever nay quoth he not for ever but for life repent it then while thou livest i shall said i but how can god forgive it i would not said i were i he yet will he certainly forgive it quoth he for he is ten times more forgiving than i am and i forgive thee i stared at him and then he said softly but quavering like ghysbrecht look at me closer i am gerard the son of eli and i looked and looked and at last lo it was gerard verily i had fallen at his feet with shame and contrition but he would not suffer me that became not mine years and his for a particular fault i say not i forgive thee without a struggle said he not being a saint but these three days thou hast spent in penitence i have worn under thy roof in prayer and i do forgive thee those were his very words margarets tears began to flow for it was in a broken and contrite voice the old man told her this unexpected trait in her gerard he continued and even with that he bade me farewell my work here is done now said he i had not the heart to stay him for let him forgive me ever so the sight of me must be wormwood to him he left me in peace and may a dying mans blessing wait on him go where he will oh girl when i think of his wrongs and thine and how he hath avenged himself by saving this stained soul of mine my heart is broken with remorse and these old eyes shed tears by night and day ghysbrecht said margaret weeping since he hath forgiven thee i forgive thee too what is done is done and thou hast let me know this day that which i had walked the world to hear but oh burgomaster thou art an understanding man now help a poor woman which hath forgiven thee her misery she then told him all that had befallen and said she they will not keep the living for him for ever he bids fair to lose that as well as break all our hearts call my servant cried the burgomaster with sudden vigour he sent him for a table and writing materials and dictated letters to the burgomasters in all the principal towns in holland and one to a prussian authority his friend his clerk and margaret wrote them and he signed them there said he the matter shall be despatched throughout holland by trusty couriers and as far as basle in switzerland and fear not but we will soon have the vicar of gouda to his village she went home animated with fresh hopes and accusing herself of ingratitude to gerard i value my wealth now said she she also made a resolution never to blame his conduct till she should hear from his own lips his reason not long after her return from tergou a fresh disaster befell catherine i must premise had secret interviews with the black sheep the very day after they were expelled and cornelis followed her to tergou and lived there on secret contributions but sybrandt chose to remain in rotterdam ere catherine left she asked margaret to lend her two gold angels for said she all mine are spent margaret was delighted to lend them or give them but the words were scarce out of her mouth ere she caught a look of regret and distress on kates face and she saw directly whither her money was going she gave catherine the money and went and shut herself up with her boy now this money was to last sybrandt till his mother could make some good excuse for visiting rotterdam again and then she would bring the idle dog some of her own industrious savings but sybrandt having gold in his pocket thought it inexhaustible and being now under no shadow of restraint led the life of a complete sot until one afternoon in a drunken frolic he climbed on the roof of the stable at the inn he was carousing in and proceeded to walk along it a feat he had performed many times when sober but now his unsteady brain made his legs unsteady and he rolled down the roof and fell with a loud thwack on to an horizontal paling where he hung a moment in a semicircle then toppled over and lay silent on the ground amidst roars of laughter from his boon companions when they came to pick him up he could not stand but fell down giggling at each attempt on this they went staggering and roaring down the street with him and carried him at great risk of another fall to the shop in the hoog straet for he had babbled his own shame all over the place as soon as he saw margaret he hiccupped out here is the doctor that cures all hurts a bonny lass he also bade her observe he bore her no malice for he was paying her a visit sore against his will wherefore prithee send away these drunkards and let you and me have tother glass to drown all unkindness all this time margaret was pale and red by turns at sight of her enemy and at his insolence but one of the men whispered what had happened and a streaky something in sybrandts face arrested her attention and he cannot stand up say you a couldnt just now try comrade be a man now i am a better man than thou roared sybrandt ill stand up and fight ye all for a crown he started to his feet and instantly rolled into his attendants arms with a piteous groan he then began to curse his boon companions and declare they had stolen away his legs he could feel nothing below the waist alas poor wretch said margaret she turned very gravely to the men and said leave him here and if you have brought him to this go on your knees for you have spoiled him for life he will never walk again his back is broken the drunken man caught these words and the foolish look of intoxication fled and a glare of anguish took its place the curse he groaned the curse margaret and reicht heynes carried him carefully and laid him on the softest bed i must do as he would do whispered margaret he was kind to ghysbrecht her opinion was verified sybrandts spine was fatally injured and he lay groaning and helpless fed and tended by her he had so deeply injured the news was sent to tergou and catherine came over it was a terrible blow to her moreover she accused herself as the cause oh false wife oh weak mother she cried i am rightly punished for my treason to my poor eli she sat for hours at a time by his bedside rocking herself in silence and was never quite herself again and the first grey hairs began to come in her poor head from that hour as for sybrandt all his cry was now for gerard he used to whine to margaret like a suffering hound oh sweet margaret oh bonny margaret for our ladys sake find gerard and bid him take his curse off me thou art gentle thou art good thou wilt entreat for me and he will refuse thee nought catherine shared his belief that gerard could cure him and joined her entreaties to his margaret hardly needed this the burgomaster and his agents having failed she employed her own and spent money like water and among these agents poor luke enrolled himself she met him one day looking very thin and spoke to him compassionately on this he began to blubber and say he was more miserable than ever he would like to be good friends again upon almost any terms dear heart said margaret sorrowfully why can you not say to yourself now i am her little brother and she is my old married sister worn down with care say so and i will indulge thee and pet thee and make thee happier than a prince well i will said luke savagely sooner than keep away from you altogether but above all give me something to do perchance i may have better luck this time get me my marriage lines said margaret turning sad and gloomy in a moment that is as much as to say get me him for where they are he is not so he may refuse to come nigh me but certes he will not deny a poor woman who loved him once her lines of betrothal how can she go without them into any honest mans house ill get them you if they are in holland said luke they are as like to be in rome replied margaret let us begin with holland observed luke prudently the slave of love was furnished with money by his soft tyrant and wandered hither and thither coopering and carpentering and looking for gerard i cant be worse if i find the vagabone said he and i may be a hantle better the months rolled on and sybrandt improved in spirit but not in body he was margarets pensioner for life and a longexpected sorrow fell upon poor catherine and left her still more bowed down and she lost her fine hearty bustling way and never went about the house singing now and her nerves were shaken and she lived in dread of some terrible misfortune falling on cornelis the curse was laid on him as well as sybrandt she prayed eli if she had been a faithful partner all these years to take cornelis into his house again and let her live awhile at rotterdam i have good daughters here said she but margaret is so tender and thoughtful and the little gerard he is my joy he grows liker his father every day and his prattle cheers my heavy heart and i do love children and eli sturdy but kindly consented sorrowfully and the people of gouda petitioned the duke for a vicar a real vicar ours cometh never nigh us said they this six months past our children they die unchristened and our folk unburied except by some chance comer giles influence baffled this just complaint once but a second petition was prepared and he gave margaret little hope that the present position could be maintained a single day so then margaret went sorrowfully to the pretty manse to see it for the last time ere it should pass for ever into strangers hands i think he would have been happy here she said and turned heartsick away on their return reicht heynes proposed to her to go and consult the hermit what said margaret joan has been at you she is the one for hermits ill go if tis but to show thee they know no more than we do and they went to the cave it was an excavation partly natural partly artificial in a bank of rock overgrown by brambles there was a rough stone door on hinges and a little window high up and two apertures through one of which the people announced their gifts to the hermit and put questions of all sorts to him and when he chose to answer his voice came dissonant and monstrous out at another small aperture on the face of the rock this line was cut felix qui in domino nixus ab orbe fugit margaret observed to her companion that this was new since she was here last ay said reicht like enough and looked up at it with awe writing even on paper she thought no trifle but on rock she whispered tis a far holier hermit than the last he used to come in the town now and then but this one neer shows his face to mortal man and that is holiness ay sure then what a saint a dormouse must be out fie mistress would ye even a beast to a man come reicht said margaret my poor father taught me overmuch so i will een sit here and look at the manse once more go thou forward and question thy solitary and tell me whether ye get nought or nonsense out of him for twill be one as reicht drew near the cave a number of birds flew out of it she gave a little scream and pointed to the cave to show margaret they had come thence on this margaret felt sure there was no human being in the cave and gave the matter no further attention she fell into a deep reverie while looking at the little manse she was startled from it by reichts hand upon her shoulder and a faint voice saying let us go home you got no answer at all reicht said margaret calmly no margaret said reicht despondently and they returned home perhaps after all margaret had nourished some faint secret hope in her heart though her reason had rejected it for she certainly went home more dejectedly just as they entered rotterdam reicht said stay oh margaret i am ill at deceit but tis death to utter ill news to thee i love thee so dear speak out sweetheart said margaret i have gone through so much i am almost past feeling any fresh trouble margaret the hermit did speak to me what a hermit there among all those birds ay and doth not that show him a holy man i gods name what said he to thee reicht alas margaret i told him thy story and i prayed him for our ladys sake tell me where thy gerard is and i waited long for an answer and presently a voice came like a trumpet pray for the soul of gerard the son of eli ah oh woe is me that i have this to tell thee sweet margaret bethink thee thou hast thy boy to live for yet let me get home said margaret faintly passing down the brede kirk straet they saw joan at the door reicht said to her eh woman she has been to your hermit and heard no good news come in said joan eager for a gossip margaret would not go in but she sat down disconsolate on the lowest step but one of the little external staircase that led into joans house and let the other two gossip their fill at the top of it oh said joan what yon hermit says is sure to be sooth he is that holy i am told that the very birds consort with him what does that prove said margaret deprecatingly i have seen my gerard tame the birds in winter till they would eat from his hand a look of pity at this parallel passed between the other two but they were both too fond of her to say what they thought joan proceeded to relate all the marvellous tales she had heard of this hermits sanctity how he never came out but at night and prayed among the wolves and they never molested him and now he bade the people not bring him so much food to pamper his body but to bring him candles the candles are to burn before his saint whispered reicht solemnly ay lass and to read his holy books wi a neighbour o mine saw his hand come out and the birds sat thereon and pecked crumbs she went for to kiss it but the holy man whippit it away in a trice they cant abide a woman to touch en or even look at em saints cant what like was his hand wife did you ask her what is my tongue for else why dear heart all one as yourn by the same token a had a thumb and four fingers look ye there now but a deal whiter nor yourn and mine ay ay and main skinny alas what could ye expect why a live upon air and prayer and candles ah well continued joan poor thing i whiles think tis best for her to know the worst and now she hath gotten a voice from heaven or almost as good and behoves her pray for his soul one thing she is not so poor now as she was and never fell riches to a better hand and she is only come into her own for that matter so she can pay the priest to say masses for him and that is a great comfort in the midst of their gossip margaret in whose ears it was all buzzing though she seemed lost in thought got softly up and crept away with her eyes on the ground and her brows bent she hath forgotten i am with her said reicht heynes ruefully she had her gossip out with joan and then went home she found margaret seated cutting out a pelisse of grey cloth and a cape to match little gerard was standing at her side inside her left arm eyeing the work and making it more difficult by wriggling about and fingering the arm with which she held the cloth steady to all which she submitted with imperturbable patience and complacency fancy a male workman so entangled impeded worried ots that mammy a pelisse my pet ots a plisse a great frock and this is the cape tot ots it for to keep his body from the cold and the cape is for his shoulders or to go over his head like the country folk tis for a hermit ots a ermit a holy man that lives in a cave all by himself in de dark ay whiles oh in the morning reicht was sent to the hermit with the pelisse and a pound of thick candles as she was going out of the door margaret said to her said you whose son gerard was nay not i think girl how could he call him gerard son of eli if you had not told him reicht persisted she had never mentioned him but as plain gerard but margaret told her flatly she did not believe her at which reicht was affronted and went out with a little toss of the head however she determined to question the hermit again and did not doubt he would be more liberal in his communication when he saw his nice new pelisse and the candles she had not been gone long when giles came in with ill news the living of gouda would be kept vacant no longer margaret was greatly distressed at this oh giles said she ask for another month they will give thee another month maybe he returned in an hour to tell her he could not get a month they have given me a week said he and what is a week drowning bodies catch at strawen was her reply a week a little week reicht came back from her errand out of spirits her oracle had declined all further communication so at least its obstinate silence might fairly be interpreted the next day margaret put reicht in charge of the shop and disappeared all day so the next day and so the next nor would she tell any one where she had been perhaps she was ashamed the fact is she spent all those days on one little spot of ground when they thought her dreaming she was applying to every word that fell from joan and reicht the whole powers of a far acuter mind than either of them possessed she went to work on a scale that never occurred to either of them she was determined to see the hermit and question him face to face not through a wall she found that by making a circuit she could get above the cave and look down without being seen by the solitary but when she came to do it she found an impenetrable mass of brambles after tearing her clothes and her hands and feet so that she was soon covered with blood the resolute patient girl took out her scissors and steadily snipped and cut till she made a narrow path through the enemy but so slow was the work that she had to leave it half done the next day she had her scissors fresh ground and brought a sharp knife as well and gently silently cut her way to the roof of the cave there she made an ambush of some of the cut brambles so that the passersby might not see her and couched with watchful eye till the hermit should come out she heard him move underneath her but he never left his cell she began to think it was true that he only came out at night the next day she came early and brought a jerkin she was making for little gerard and there she sat all day working and watching with dogged patience at four oclock the birds began to feed and a great many of the smaller kinds came fluttering round the cave and one or two went in but most of them taking a preliminary seat on the bushes suddenly discovered margaret and went off with an agitated flirt of their little wings and although they sailed about in the air they would not enter the cave presently to encourage them the hermit all unconscious of the cause of their tremors put out a thin white hand with a few crumbs in it margaret laid down her work softly and gliding her body forward like a snake looked down at it from above it was but a few feet from her it was as the woman described it a thin white hand presently the other hand came out with a piece of bread and the two hands together broke it and scattered the crumbs but that other hand had hardly been out two seconds ere the violet eyes that were watching above dilated and the gentle bosom heaved and the whole frame quivered like a leaf in the wind what her swift eye had seen i leave the reader to guess she suppressed the scream that rose to her lips but the effort cost her dear soon the left hand of the hermit began to swim indistinctly before her gloating eyes and with a deep sigh her head drooped and she lay like a broken lily she was in a deep swoon to which perhaps her long fast today and the agitation and sleeplessness of many preceding days contributed and there lay beauty intelligence and constancy pale and silent and little that hermit guessed who was so near him the little birds hopped on her now and one nearly entangled his little feet in her rich auburn hair she came back to her troubles the sun was set she was very cold she cried a little but i think it was partly from the remains of physical weakness and then she went home praying god and the saints to enlighten her and teach her what to do for the best when she got home she was pale and hysterical and would say nothing in answer to all their questions but her favourite word we are wading in deep waters the night seemed to have done wonders for her she came to catherine who was sitting sighing by the fireside and kissed her and said mother what would you like best in the world eh dear replied catherine despondently i know nought that would make me smile now i have parted from too many that were dear to me gerard lost again as soon as found kate in heaven and sybrandt down for life poor mother mother dear gouda manse is to be furnished and cleaned and made ready all in a hurry see here be ten gold angels make them go far good mother for i have taen over many already from my boy for a set of useless loons that were aye going to find him for me catherine and reicht stared at her a moment in silence and then out burst a flood of questions to none of which would she give a reply nay said she i have lain on my bed and thought and thought and thought whiles you were all sleeping and methinks i have got the clue to all i love you dear mother but ill trust no womans tongue if i fail this time ill have none to blame but margaret brandt a resolute woman is a very resolute thing and there was a deep dogged determination in margarets voice and brow that at once convinced catherine it would be idle to put any more questions at that time she and reicht lost themselves in conjectures and catherine whispered reicht bide quiet then twill leak out a shrewd piece of advice founded on general observation within an hour catherine was on the road to gouda in a cart with two stout girls to help her and quite a siege artillery of mops and pails and brushes she came back with heightened colour and something of the old sparkle in her eye and kissed margaret with a silent warmth that spoke volumes and at five in the morning was off again to gouda that night as reicht was in her first sleep a hand gently pressed her shoulder and she awoke and was going to scream whisht said margaret and put her finger to her lips she then whispered rise softly don thy habits and come with me when she came down margaret begged her to loose dragon and bring him along now dragon was a great mastiff who had guarded margaret van eyck and reicht two lone women for some years and was devotedly attached to the latter margaret and reicht went out with dragon walking majestically behind them they came back long after midnight and retired to rest catherine never knew margaret read her friends she saw the sturdy faithful frisian could hold her tongue and catherine could not yet i am not sure she would have trusted even reicht had her nerve equalled her spirit but with all her daring and resolution she was a tender timid woman a little afraid of the dark very afraid of being alone in it and desperately afraid of wolves now dragon could kill a wolf in a brace of shakes but then dragon would not go with her but only with reicht so altogether she made one confidante the next night they made another moonlight reconnaissance and as i think with some result for not the next night it rained that night and extinguished their courage but the next after they took with them a companion the last in the world reicht heynes would have thought of yet she gave her warm approval as soon as she was told he was to go with them imagine how these stealthy assailants trembled and panted when the moment of action came imagine if you can the tumult in margarets breast the thrilling hopes chasing and chased by sickening fears the strange and perhaps unparalleled mixture of tender familiarity and distant awe with which a lovely and highspirited but tender adoring woman wife in the eye of the law and no wife in the eye of the church trembling blushing paling glowing shivering stole at night noiseless as the dew upon the hermit of gouda and the stars above seemed never so bright and calm chapter xcii yes the hermit of gouda was the vicar of gouda and knew it not so absolute was his seclusion my reader is aware that the moment the frenzy of his passion passed he was seized with remorse for having been betrayed into it but perhaps only those who have risen as high in religious spirit as he had and suddenly fallen can realize the terror at himself that took possession of him he felt like one whom selfconfidence had betrayed to the very edge of a precipice ah good jerome he cried how much better you knew me than i knew myself how bitter yet wholesome was your admonition accustomed to search his own heart he saw at once that the true cause of his fury was margaret i love her then better than god said he despairingly better than the church from such a love what can spring to me or to her he shuddered at the thought let the strong battle temptation tis for the weak to flee and who is weaker than i have shown myself what is my penitence my religion a pack of cards built by degrees into a fairseeming structure and lo one breath of earthly love and it lies in the dust i must begin again and on a surer foundation he resolved to leave holland at once and spend years of his life in some distant convent before returning to it by that time the temptations of earthly passion would be doubly baffled and older and a better monk he should be more master of his earthly affections and margaret seeing herself abandoned would marry and love another the very anguish this last thought cost him showed the selfsearcher and selfdenier that he was on the path of religious duty but in leaving her for his immortal good and hers he was not to neglect her temporal weal indeed the sweet thought he could make her comfortable for life and rich in this worlds goods which she was not bound to despise sustained him in the bitter struggle it cost him to turn his back on her without one kind word or look oh what will she think of me he groaned shall i not seem to her of all creatures the most heartless inhuman but so best ay better she should hate me miserable that i am heaven is merciful and giveth my broken heart this comfort i can make that villain restore her own and she shall never lose another true lover by poverty another ah me ah me god and the saints to mine aid how he fared on this errand has been related but first as you may perhaps remember he went at night to shrive the hermit of gouda he found him dying and never left him till he had closed his eyes and buried him beneath the floor of the little oratory attached to his cell it was the peaceful end of a stormy life the hermit had been a soldier and even now carried a steel corselet next his skin saying he was now christs soldier as he had been satans when clement had shriven him and prayed by him he in his turn sought counsel of one who was dying in so pious a frame the hermit advised him to be his successor in this peaceful retreat his had been a hard fight against the world the flesh and the devil and he had never thoroughly baffled them till he retired into the citadel of solitude these words and the hermits pious and peaceful death which speedily followed and set as it were the seal of immortal truth on them made a deep impression upon clement nor in his case had they any prejudice to combat the solitary recluse was still profoundly revered in the church whether immured as an anchorite or anchoress in some cave or cell belonging to a monastery or hidden in the more savage but laxer seclusion of the independent hermitage and clement knew more about the hermits of the church than most divines at his time of life he had read much thereon at the monastery near tergou had devoured their lives with wonder and delight in the manuscripts of the vatican and conversed earnestly about them with the mendicant friars of several nations before printing these friars were the great circulators of those local annals and biographies which accumulated in the convents of every land then his teacher jerome had been three years an anchorite on the heights of camaldoli where for more than four centuries the thebaid had been revived and jerome cold and curt on most religious themes was warm with enthusiasm on this one he had pored over the annals of st john baptists abbey round about which the hermits caves were scattered and told him the names of many a noble and many a famous warrior who had ended his days there a hermit and of many a bishop and archbishop who had passed from the see to the hermitage or from the hermitage to the see among the former the archbishop of ravenna among the latter pope victor the ninth he told him too with grim delight of their multifarious austerities and how each hermit set himself to find where he was weakest and attacked himself without mercy or remission till there even there he was strongest and how seven times in the twentyfour hours in thunder rain or snow by daylight twilight moonlight or torchlight the solitaries flocked from distant points over rugged precipitous ways to worship in the convent church at matins at prime tierce sexte nones vespers and compline he even under eager questioning described to him the persons of famous anchorites he had sung the psalter and prayed with there the only intercourse their vows allowed except with special permission moncata duke of moncata and cardova and hidalgo of spain who in the flower of his youth had retired thither from the pomps vanities and pleasures of the world father john baptist of novara who had led armies to battle but was now a private soldier of christ cornelius samuel and sylvanus this last when the great duchess de medici obtained the popes leave hitherto refused to visit camaldoli went down and met her at the first wooden cross and there surrounded as she was with courtiers and flatterers remonstrated with her and persuaded her and warned her not to profane that holy mountain where no woman for so many centuries had placed her foot and she awed by the place and the man retreated with all her captains soldiers courtiers and pages from that one hoary hermit at basle clement found fresh materials especially with respect to german and english anchorites and he had even prepared a catena eremitarum from the year of our lord when paul of thebes commenced his ninety years of solitude down to the year he called them angelorum amici et animalium ie friends of angels and animals thus though in those days he never thought to be a recluse the road was paved so to speak and when the dying hermit of gouda blessed the citadel of solitude where he had fought the good fight and won it and invited him to take up the breastplate of faith that now fell off his own shrunken body clement said within himself heaven itself led my foot hither to this end it struck him too as no small coincidence that his patron st bavon was a hermit and an austere one a cuirassier of the solitary cell as soon as he was reconciled to ghysbrecht van swieten he went eagerly to his abode praying heaven it might not have been already occupied in these three days the fear was not vain these famous dens never wanted a human tenant long he found the rude stone door ajar then he made sure he was too late he opened the door and went softly in no the cell was vacant and there were the hermits great ivory crucifix his pens ink seeds and memento mori a skull his cilice of hair and another of bristles his wellworn sheepskin pelisse and hood his hammer chisel and psaltery etc men and women had passed that way but none had ventured to intrude far less to steal faith and simplicity had guarded that keyless door more securely than the houses of the laity were defended by their gates like a modern gaol and think iron bars at every window and the gentry by moat bastion chevaux de frise and portcullis as soon as clement was fairly in the cell there was a loud flap and a flutter and down came a great brown owl from a corner and whirled out of the window driving the air cold on clements face he started and shuddered was this seeming owl something diabolical trying to deter him from his souls good on second thoughts might it not be some good spirit the hermit had employed to keep the cell for him perhaps the hermit himself finally he concluded that it was just an owl and that he would try and make friends with it he kneeled down and inaugurated his new life with prayer clement had not only an earthly passion to quell the power of which made him tremble for his eternal weal but he had a penance to do for having given way to ire his besetting sin and cursed his own brothers he looked round this roomy cell furnished with so many comforts and compared it with the pictures in his mind of the hideous place eremus in eremo a desert in a desert where holy jerome hermit and the plutarch of hermits had wrestled with sickness temptation and despair four mortal years and with the inaccessible and thorny niche a hole in a precipice where the boy hermit benedict buried himself and lived three years on the pittance the good monk romanus could spare him from his scanty commons and subdivided that mouthful with his friend a raven and the hollow tree of his patron st bavon and the earthly purgatory at fribourg where lived a nameless saint in a horrid cavern his eyes chilled with perpetual gloom and his ears stunned with an eternal waterfall and the pillar on which st simeon stylita existed fortyfive years and the destina or stone box of st dunstan where like hilarion in his bulrush hive sepulchro potius quam domu he could scarce sit stand or lie and the living tombs sealed with lead of thais and christina and other recluses and the damp dungeon of st alred these and scores more of the dismal dens in which true hermits had worn out their wasted bodies on the rock and the rock under their sleeping bodies and their praying knees all came into his mind and he said to himself this sweet retreat is for safety of the soul but what for penance jesu aid me against faults to come and for the fault i rue face of man i will not see for a twelvemonth and a day he had famous precedents in his eye even for this last and unusual severity in fact the original hermit of this very cell was clearly under the same vow hence the two apertures through which he was spoken to and replied adopting in other respects the uniform rule of hermits and anchorites he divided his day into the seven offices ignoring the petty accidents of light and dark creations both of him to whom he prayed so unceasingly he learned the psalter by heart and in all the intervals of devotion not occupied by broken slumbers he worked hard with his hands no article of the hermits rule was more strict or more ancient than this and here his selfimposed penance embarrassed him for what work could he do without being seen that should benefit his neighbours for the hermit was to labour for himself in those cases only where his subsistence depended on it now clements modest needs were amply supplied by the villagers on moonlight nights he would steal out like a thief and dig some poor mans garden on the outskirts of the village he made baskets and dropped them slily at humble doors and since he could do nothing for the bodies of those who passed by his cell in daytime he went out in the dead of the night with his hammer and his chisel and carved moral and religious sentences all down the road upon the sandstone rocks who knows said he often a chance shaft strikes home oh sore heart comfort thou the poor and bereaved with holy words of solace in their native tongue for he said well tis clavis ad corda plebis also he remembered the learned colonna had told him of the written mountains in the east where kings had inscribed their victories what said clement are they so wise those eastern monarchs to engrave their warlike glory upon the rock making a blood bubble endure so long as earth and shall i leave the rocks about me silent on the king of glory at whose word they were and at whose breath they shall be dust nay but these stones shall speak to weary wayfarers of eternal peace and of the lamb whose frail and afflicted yet happy servant worketh them among now at this time the inspired words that have consoled the poor and the afflicted for so many ages were not yet printed in dutch so that these sentences of gold from the holy evangelists came like fresh oracles from heaven or like the dew on parched flowers and the poor hermits written rocks softened a heart or two and sent the heavy laden singing on their way these holy oracles that seemed to spring up around him like magic his prudent answers through his window to such as sought ghostly counsel and above all his invisibility soon gained him a prodigious reputation this was not diminished by the medical advice they now and then extorted from him sore against his will by tears and entreaties for if the patients got well they gave the holy hermit the credit and if not they laid all the blame on the devil i think he killed nobody for his remedies were womanish and weak sage and wormwood sion hyssop borage spikenard dogstongue our ladys mantle feverfew and faith and all in small quantities except the last then his abstinence sure sign of a saint the eggs and milk they brought him at first he refused with horror know ye not the hermits rule is bread or herbs and water eggs they are birds in disguise for when the bird dieth then the egg rotteth as for milk it is little better than white blood and when they brought him too much bread he refused it then they used to press it on him nay holy father give the overplus to the poor you who go among the poor can do that better is bread a thing to fling haphazard from an hermits window and to those who persisted after this to live on charity

heart he was bent on destroying he had suffered and survived the pang of bereavement and the mind cannot quite repeat such anguish then he had built up a habit of looking on her as dead after that strange scene in the church and churchyard of st laurens that habit might be compared to a structure riven by a thunderbolt it was shattered but stones enough stood to found a similar habit on to look on her as dead to him and by severe subdivision of his time and thoughts by unceasing prayers and manual labour he did in about three months succeed in benumbing the earthly half of his heart but lo within a day or two of this first symptom of mental peace returning slowly there descended upon his mind a horrible despondency words cannot utter it for words never yet painted a likeness of despair voices seemed to whisper in his ear kill thyself kill kill kill and he longed to obey the voices for life was intolerable he wrestled with his dark enemy with prayers and tears he prayed god but to vary his temptation oh let mine enemy have power to scourge me with redhot whips to tear me leagues and leagues over rugged places by the hair of my head as he has served many a holy hermit that yet baffled him at last to fly on me like a raging lion to gnaw me with a serpents fangs any pain any terror but this horrible gloom of the soul that shuts me from all light of thee and of the saints and now a freezing thought crossed him what if the triumphs of the powers of darkness over christian souls in desert places had been suppressed and only their defeats recorded or at least in full for dark hints were scattered about antiquity that now first began to grin at him with terrible meaning they wandered in the desert and perished by serpents said an ancient father of hermits that went into solitude and were seen no more and another at a more recent epoch wrote vertuntur ad melancholiam they turn to gloomy madness these two statements were they not one for the ancient fathers never spoke with regret of the death of the body no the hermits so lost were perished souls and the serpents were diabolical thoughts the natural brood of solitude st jerome went into the desert with three companions one fled in the first year two died how the single one that lasted was a gigantic soul with an iron body the cotemporary who related this made no comment expressed no wonder what then if here was a glimpse of the true proportion in every age and many souls had always been lost in solitude for one gigantic mind and iron body that survived this terrible ordeal the darkened recluse now cast his despairing eyes over antiquity to see what weapons the christian arsenal contained that might befriend him the greatest of all was prayer alas it was a part of his malady to be unable to pray with true fervour the very system of mechanical supplication he had for months carried out so severely by rule had rather checked than fostered his power of originating true prayer he prayed louder than ever but the heart hung back cold and gloomy and let the words go up alone poor wingless prayers he cried you will not get halfway to heaven a fiend of this complexion had been driven out of king saul by music clement took up the hermits psaltery and with much trouble mended the strings and tuned it no he could not play it his soul was so out of tune the sounds jarred on it and made him almost mad ah wretched me he cried saul had a saint to play to him he was not alone with the spirits of darkness but here is no sweet bard of israel to play to me i lonely with crushed heart on which a black fiend sitteth mountain high must make the music to uplift that heart to heaven it may not be and he grovelled on the earth weeping and tearing his hair vertebatur ad melancholiam it requires nowadays a strong effort of the imagination to realize the effect on poor people who had never seen them before of such sentences as this blessed are the poor etc the primitive writer was so interpreted by others besides clement and in particular by peter of blois a divine of the twelfth century whose comment is noteworthy as he himself was a fortyyear hermit chapter xciii one day as he lay there sighing and groaning prayerless tuneless hopeless a thought flashed into his mind what he had done for the poor and the wayfarer he would do for himself he would fill his den of despair with the name of god and the magic words of holy writ and the pious prayerful consolations of the church then like christian at apollyons feet he reached his hand suddenly out and caught not his sword for he had none but peaceful labours humbler weapon his chisel and worked with it as if his soul depended on his arm they say that michael angelo in the next generation used to carve statues not like our timid sculptors by modelling the work in clay and then setting a mechanic to chisel it but would seize the block conceive the image and at once with mallet and steel make the marble chips fly like mad about him and the mass sprout into form even so clement drew no lines to guide his hand he went to his memory for the gracious words and then dashed at his work and eagerly graved them in the soft stone between working and fighting he begged his visitors for candle ends and rancid oil anything is good enough for me he said if twill but burn so at night the cave glowed afar off like a blacksmiths forge through the window and the gaping chinks of the rude stone door and the rustics beholding crossed themselves and suspected deviltries and within the holy talismans one after another came upon the walls and the sparks and the chips flew day and night night and day as the soldier of solitude and of the church plied with sighs and groans his bloodless weapon between working and fighting kyrie

who for thee was all nailed unto the cross for do but call to mind the sufferings of christ and there is nought on earth too hard to endure with composure soothed a little a very little by the sweet and pious words he was raising all round him and weighed down with watching and working night and day clement one morning sank prostrate with fatigue and a deep sleep overpowered him for many hours awaking quietly he heard a little cheep he opened his eyes and lo upon his breviary which was on a low stool near his feet ruffling all his feathers with a single pull and smoothing them as suddenly and cocking his bill this way and that with a vast display of cunning purely imaginary perched a robin redbreast clement held his breath he half closed his eyes lest they should frighten the airy guest down came robin on the floor when there he went through his pantomime of astuteness and then pim pim pim with three stiff little hops like a ball of worsted on vertical wires he was on the hermits bare foot on this eminence he swelled and contracted again with ebb and flow of feathers but clement lost this for he quite closed his eyes and scarce drew his breath in fear of frightening and losing his visitor he was content to feel the minute claw on his foot he could but just feel it and that by help of knowing it was there presently a little flirt with two little wings and the feathered busybody was on the breviary again then clement determined to try and feed this pretty little fidget without frightening it away but it was very difficult he had a piece of bread within reach but how get at it i think he was five minutes creeping his hand up to that bread and when there he must not move his arm he slily got a crumb between a finger and thumb and shot it as boys do marbles keeping the hand quite still cockrobin saw it fall near him and did sagacity but moved not when another followed and then another he popped down and caught up one of the crumbs but not quite understanding this mystery fled with it for more security to an eminence to wit the hermits knee and so the game proceeded till a much larger fragment than usual rolled along here was a prize cockrobin pounced on it bore it aloft and fled so swiftly into the world with it the cave resounded with the buffeted air now bless thee sweet bird sighed the stricken solitary thy wings are music and thou a feathered ray camedst to light my darkened soul and from that to his orisons and then to his tools with a little bit of courage and this was his days work veni creator spiritus mentes tuorem visita imple superna gratia quae tu creasti pectora accende lumen sensibus mentes tuorum visita infirma nostri corporis virtute firmans perpeti and so the days rolled on and the weather got colder and clements heart got warmer and despondency was rolling away and byandby somehow or another it was gone he had outlived it it had come like a cloud and it went like one and presently all was reversed his cell seemed illuminated with joy his work pleased him his prayers were full of unction his psalms of praise hosts of little birds followed their crimson leader and flying from snow and a parish full of cains made friends one after another with abel fast friends and one keen frosty night as he sang the praises of god to his tuneful psaltery and his hollow cave rang forth the holy psalmody upon the night as if that cave itself was tubals surrounding shell or davids harp he heard a clear whine not unmelodious it became louder and less in tune he peeped through the chinks of his rude door and there sat a great red wolf moaning melodiously with his nose high in the air clement was rejoiced my sins are going he cried and the creatures of god are owning me one after another and in a burst of enthusiasm he struck up the laud praise him all ye creatures of his let everything that hath breath praise the lord and all the time he sang the wolf bayed at intervals but above all he seemed now to be drawing nearer to that celestial intercourse which was the sign and the bliss of the true hermit for he had dreams about the saints and angels so vivid they were more like visions he saw bright figures clad in woven snow they bent on him eyes lovelier than those of the antelopes he had seen at rome and fanned him with broad wings hued like the rainbow and their gentle voices bade him speed upon his course he had not long enjoyed this felicity when his dreams began to take another and a strange complexion he wandered with fra colonna over the relics of antique nations and the friar was lame and had a staff and this staff he waved over the mighty ruins and were they egyptian greek or roman straightway the temples and palaces whose wrecks they were rose again like an exhalation and were thronged with the famous dead songsters that might have eclipsed both apollo and his rival poured forth their lays women godlike in form and draped like minerva swam round the marble courts in voluptuous but easy and graceful dances here sculptors carved away amidst admiring pupils and forms of supernatural beauty grew out of parian marble in a quarter of an hour and grave philosophers conversed on high and subtle matters with youth listening reverently it was a long time ago and still beneath all this wonderful panorama a sort of suspicion or expectation lurked in the dreamers mind this is a prologue a flourish there is something behind something that means me no good something mysterious awful and one night that the wizard colonna had transcended himself he pointed with his stick and there was a swallowing up of many great ancient cities and the pair stood on a vast sandy plain with a huge crimson sun sinking to rest there were great palmtrees and there were bulrush hives scarce a mans height dotted all about to the sandy horizon and the crimson sun these are the anchorites of the theban desert said colonna calmly followers not of christ and his apostles and the great fathers but of the greek pupils of the egyptian pupils of the brachmans and gymnosophists and clement thought that he burned to go and embrace the holy men and tell them his troubles and seek their advice but he was tied by the feet somehow and could not move and the crimson sun sank and it got dusk and the hives scarce visible and colonnas figure became shadowy and shapeless but his eyes glowed ten times brighter and this thing all eyes spoke and said nay let them be a pack of fools i see how dismal it all is then with a sudden sprightliness but i hear one of them has a manuscript of petronius on papyrus i go to buy it farewell for ever for ever for ever and it was pitch dark and a light came at clements back like a gentle stroke a glorious roseate light it warmed as well as brightened it loosened his feet from the ground he turned round and there her face irradiated with sunshine and her hair glittering like the gloriola of a saint was margaret brandt she blushed and smiled and cast a look of ineffable tenderness on him gerard she murmured be whose thou wilt by day but at night be mine even as she spoke the agitation of seeing her so suddenly awakened him and he found himself lying trembling from head to foot that radiant figure and mellow voice seemed to have struck his nightly keynote awake he could pray and praise and worship god he was master of his thoughts but if he closed his eyes in sleep margaret or satan in her shape beset him a seeming angel of light he might dream of a thousand different things wide as the poles asunder ere he woke the imperial figure was sure to come and extinguish all the rest in a moment stellas exortus uti aetherius sol for she came glowing with two beauties never before united an angels radiance and a womans blushes angels cannot blush so he knew it was a fiend he was alarmed but not so much surprised as at the demons last artifice from anthony to nicholas of the rock scarce hermit that had not been thus beset sometimes with gay voluptuous visions sometimes with lovely phantoms warm tangible and womanly without demons within nor always baffled even by the saints witness that angel form with a devils heart that came hanging its lovely head like a bruised flower to st macarius with a feigned tale and wept and wept and wept and beguiled him first of his tears and then of half his virtue but with the examples of satanic power and craft had come down copious records of the hermits triumphs and the weapons by which they had conquered domandum est corpus the body must be tamed this had been their watchword for twelve hundred years it was a tremendous warcry for they called the earthly affections as well as appetites body and crushed the whole heart through the suffering and mortified flesh clement then said to himself that the great enemy of man had retired but to spring with more effect and had allowed him a few days of true purity and joy only to put him off his guard against the soft blandishments he was pouring over the soul that had survived the buffeting of his black wings he applied himself to tame the body he shortened his sleep lengthened his prayers and increased his severe temperance to abstinence hitherto following the ordinary rule he had eaten only at sunset now he ate but once in fortyeight hours drinking a little water every day on this the visions became more distinct then he flew to a famous antidote to the grand febrifuge of anchoritescold water he found the deepest part of the stream that ran by his cell it rose not far off at a holy well and clearing the bottom of the large stones made a hole where he could stand in water to the chin and fortified by so many examples he sprang from his rude bed upon the next diabolical assault and entered the icy water it made him gasp and almost shriek with the cold it froze his marrow i shall die he cried i shall die but better this than fire eternal and the next day he was so stiff in all his joints he could not move and he seemed one great ache and even in sleep he felt that his very bones were like so many raging teeth till the phantom he dreaded came and gave one pitying smile and all the pain was gone then feeling that to go into the icy water again enfeebled by fasts as he was might perhaps carry the guilt of suicide he scourged himself till the blood ran and so lay down smarting and when exhaustion began to blunt the smart down to a throb that moment the present was away and the past came smiling back he sat with margaret at the dukes feast the minstrels played divinely and the purple fountains gushed youth and love reigned in each heart and perfumed the very air then the scene shifted and they stood at the altar together man and wife and no interruption this time and they wandered hand in hand and told each other their horrible dreams as for him he had dreamed she was dead and he was a monk and really the dream had been so vivid and so full of particulars that only his eyesight could even now convince him it was only a dream and they were really one and this new keynote once struck every tune ran upon it awake he was clement the hermit risen from unearthly visions of the night as dangerous as they were sweet asleep he was gerard eliassoen the happy husband of the loveliest and best and truest girl in holland all the happier that he had been for some time the sport of hideous dreams in which he had lost her his constant fasts coupled with other austerities and the deep mental anxiety of a man fighting with a supernatural foe had now reduced him nearly to a skeleton but still on those aching bones hung flesh unsubdued and quivering with an earthly passion so however he thought or why had ill spirits such power over him his opinion was confirmed when one day he detected himself sinking to sleep actually with a feeling of complacency because now margaret would come and he should feel no more pain and the unreal would be real and the real unreal for an hour on this he rose hastily with a cry of dismay and stripping to the skin climbed up to the brambles above his cave and flung himself on them and rolled on them writhing with the pain then he came into his den a mass of gore and lay moaning for hours till out of sheer exhaustion he fell into a deep and dreamless sleep he awoke to bodily pain and mental exultation he had broken the fatal spell yes it was broken another and another day passed and her image molested him no more but he caught himself sighing at his victory the birds got tamer and tamer they perched upon his hand two of them let him gild their little claws eating but once in two days he had more to give them his tranquility was not to last long a womans voice came in from the outside told him his own story in a very few words and asked him to tell her where gerard was to be found he was so astounded he could only say with an instinct of selfdefence pray for the soul of gerard the son of eli meaning that he was dead to the world and he sat wondering when the woman was gone he determined after an inward battle to risk being seen and he peeped after her to see who it could be but he took so many precautions and she ran so quickly back to her friend that the road was clear satan said he directly and that night back came his visions of earthly love and happiness so vividly he could count every auburn hair in margarets head and see the pupils of her eyes then he began to despair and said i must leave this country here i am bound fast in memorys chain and began to dread his cell he said a breath from hell hath infected it and robbed even these holy words of their virtue and unconsciously imitating st jerome a victim of earthly hallucinations as overpowering and coarser he took his warmest covering out into the wood hard by and there flung down under a tree that torn and wrinkled leather bag of bones which a little ago might have served a sculptor for apollo whether the fever of his imagination intermitted as a master mind of our day has shown that all things intermit or that this really broke some subtle link i know not but his sleep was dreamless he awoke nearly frozen but warm with joy within i shall yet be a true hermit dei gratia said he the next day some good soul left on his little platform a new lambswool pelisse and cape warm soft and ample he had a moments misgiving on account of its delicious softness and warmth but that passed it was the right skin and a mark that heaven approved his present course it restored warmth to his bones after he came in from his short rest and now at one moment he saw victory before him if he could but live to it at another he said to himself tis but another lull be on thy guard clement and this thought agitated his nerves and kept him in continual awe he was like a soldier within the enemys lines one night a beautiful clear frosty night he came back to his cell after a short rest the stars were wonderful heaven seemed a thousand times larger as well as brighter than earth and to look with a thousand eyes instead of one oh wonderful he cried that there should be men who do crimes by night and others scarce less mad who live for this little world and not for that great and glorious one which nightly to all eyes not blinded by custom reveals its glowing glories thank god i am a hermit and in this mood he came to his cell door he paused at it it was closed why methought i left it open said he the wind there is not a breath of wind what means this he stood with his hand upon the rugged door he looked through one of the great chinks for it was much smaller in places than the aperture it pretended to close and saw his little oil wick burning just where he had left it how is it with me he sighed when i start and tremble at nothing either i did shut it or the fiend hath shut it after me to disturb my happy soul retro sathanas and he entered his cave rapidly and began with somewhat nervous expedition to light one of his largest tapers while he was lighting it there was a soft sigh in the cave he started and dropped the candle just as it was lighting and it went out he stooped for it hurriedly and lighted it listening intently when it was lighted he shaded it with his hand from behind and threw the faint light all round the cell in the farthest corner the outline of the wall seemed broken he took a step towards the place with his heart beating the candle at the same time getting brighter he saw it was the figure of a woman another step with his knees knocking together it was margaret brandt beat down satan under our feet up hearts o god our refuge and strength o lamb of god that takest away the sins of the world have mercy upon me o holy trinity one god have mercy upon us from the assaults of demonsfrom the wrath to come from everlasting damnation deliver us o lord see the english collect st michael and all angels of whom may we seek succour but of thee o lord who for our sins art justly displeased and that torrent of prayer the following verse dr dickson author of fallacies of the faculty etc it is related of a mediaeval hermit that being offered a garment made of cats skins he rejected it saying i have heard of a lamb of god but i never heard of a cat of god chapter xciv her attitude was one to excite pity rather than terror in eyes not blinded by a preconceived notion her bosom was fluttering like a bird and the red and white coming and going in her cheeks and she had her hand against the wall by the instinct of timid things she trembled so and the marvellous mixed gaze of love and pious awe and pity and tender memories those purple eyes cast on the emaciated and glaring hermit was an event in nature aha he cried thou art come at last in flesh and blood come to me as thou camest to holy anthony but i am ware of thee i thought thy wiles were not exhausted i am armed with this he snatched up his small crucifix and held it out at her astonished and the candle in the other hand both crucifix and candle shaking violently exorcizo te ah no cried she piteously and put out two pretty deprecating palms alas work me no ill it is margaret liar shouted the hermit margaret was fair but not so supernatural fair as thou thou didst shrink at that sacred name thou subtle hypocrite in nomine dei exorcizo vos ah jesu gasped margaret in extremity of terror curse me not i will go home i thought i might come for very manhood belatin me not oh gerard is it thus you and i meet after all after all and she cowered almost to her knees and sobbed with superstitious fear and wounded affection impregnated as he was with satanophobia he might perhaps have doubted still whether this distressed creature all woman and nature was not all art and fiend but her spontaneous appeal to that sacred name dissolved his chimera and let him see with his eyes and hear with his ears he uttered a cry of selfreproach and tried to raise her but what with fasts what with the overpowering emotion of a long solitude so broken he could not what he gasped shaking over her and is it thou and have i met thee with hard words alas and they were both choked with emotion and could not speak for a while i heed it not much said margaret bravely struggling with her tears you took me for another for a devil oh oh oh oh oh forgive me sweet soul and as soon as he could speak more than a word at a time he said i have been much beset by the evil one since i came here margaret looked round with a shudder like enow then oh take my hand and let me lead thee from this foul place he gazed at her with astonishment what desert my cell and go into the world again is it for that thou hast come to me said he sadly and reproachfully ay gerard i am come to take thee to thy pretty vicarage art vicar of gouda thanks to heaven and thy good brother giles and mother and i have made it so neat for thee gerard tis well enow in winter i promise thee but bide a bit till the hawthorn bloom and anon thy walls put on their kirtle of brave roses and sweet woodbine have we forgotten thee and the foolish things thou lovest and dear gerard thy mother is waiting and tis late for her to be out of her bed prithee prithee come and the moment we are out of this foul hole ill show thee a treasure thou hast gotten and knowest nought ont or sure hadst never fled from us so alas what is to do what have i ignorantly said to be regarded thus for he had drawn himself all up into a heap and was looking at her with a strange gaze of fear and suspicion blended unhappy girl said he solemnly yet deeply agitated would you have me risk my soul and yours for a miserable vicarage and the flowers that grow on it but this is not thy doing the bowelless fiend sends thee poor simple girl to me with this bait but oh cunning fiend i will unmask thee even to this thine instrument and she shall see thee and abhor thee as i do margaret my lost love why am i here because i love thee oh no gerard you love me not or you would not have hidden from me there was no need let there be no deceit between us twain that have loved so true and after this night shall meet no more on earth now god forbid said she i love thee and thou hast not forgotten me or thou hadst married ere this and hadst not been the one to find me buried here from sight of man i am a priest a monk what but folly or sin can come of you and me living neighbours and feeding a passion innocent once but now so heaven wills it impious and unholy no though my heart break i must be firm tis i that am the man tis i that am the priest you and i must meet no more till i am schooled by solitude and thou art wedded to another i consent to my doom but not to thine i would ten times liever die yet i will marry ay wed misery itself sooner than let thee lie in this foul dismal place with yon sweet manse awaiting for thee clement groaned at each word she spoke out stood clearer and clearer two thingshis duty and the agony it must cost my beloved said he with a strange mixture of tenderness and dogged resolution i bless thee for giving me one more sight of thy sweet face and may god forgive thee and bless thee for destroying in a minute the holy peace it hath taken six months of solitude to build no matter a year of penance will dei gratia restore me to my calm my poor margaret i seem cruel yet i am kind tis best we part ay this moment part gerard never we have seen what comes of parting part why you have not heard half my story no nor the tithe tis not for thy mere comfort i take thee to gouda manse hear me i may not thy very voice is a temptation with its music memorys delight but i say you shall hear me gerard for forth this place i go not unheard then must we part by other means said clement sadly alack what other means wouldst put me to thine own door being the stronger nay margaret well thou knowest i would suffer many deaths rather than put force on thee thy sweet body is dearer to me than my own but a million times dearer to me are our immortal souls both thine and mine i have withstood this direst temptation of all long enow now i must fly it farewell farewell he made to the door and had actually opened it and got half out when she darted after and caught him by the arm nay then another must speak for me i thought to reward thee for yielding to me but unkind that thou art i need his help i find turn then this way one moment nay nay but i say ay and then turn thy back on us an thou canst she somewhat relaxed her grasp thinking he would never deny her so small a favour but at this he saw his opportunity and seized it fly clement fly he almost shrieked and his religious enthusiasm giving him for a moment his old strength he burst wildly away from her and after a few steps bounded over the little stream and ran beside it but finding he was not followed stopped and looked back she was lying on her face with her hands spread out yes without meaning it he had thrown her down and hurt her when he saw that he groaned and turned back a step but suddenly by another impulse flung himself into the icy water instead there kill my body he cried but save my soul whilst he stood there up to his throat in liquid ice so to speak margaret uttered one long piteous moan and rose to her knees he saw her as plain almost as in midday saw her pale face and her eyes glistening and then in the still night he heard these words oh god thou that knowest all thou seest how i am used forgive me then for i will not live another day with this she suddenly started to her feet and flew like some wild creature wounded to death close by his miserable hidingplace shrieking cruelcruelcruelcruel what manifold anguish may burst from a human heart in a single syllable there were wounded love and wounded pride and despair and coming madness all in that piteous cry clement heard and it froze his heart with terror and remorse worse than the icy water chilled the marrow of his bones he felt he had driven her from him for ever and in the midst of his dismal triumph the greatest he had won there came an almost incontrollable impulse to curse the church to curse religion itself for exacting such savage cruelty from mortal man at last he crawled half dead out of the water and staggered to his den i am safe here he groaned she will never come near me again unmanly ungrateful wretch that i am and he flung his emaciated frozen body down on the floor not without a secret hope that it might never rise thence alive but presently he saw by the hourglass that it was past midnight on this he rose slowly and took off his wet things and moaning all the time at the pain he had caused her he loved put on the old hermits cilice of bristles and over that his breastplate he had never worn either of these before doubting himself worthy to don the arms of that tried soldier but now he must give himself every aid the bristles might distract his earthly remorse by bodily pain and there might be holy virtue in the breastplate then he kneeled down and prayed god humbly to release him that very night from the burden of the flesh then he lighted all his candles and recited his psalter doggedly each word seemed to come like a lump of lead from a leaden heart and to fall leaden to the ground and in this mechanical office every now and then he moaned with all his soul in the midst of which he suddenly observed a little bundle in the corner he had not seen before in the feebler light and at one end of it something like gold spun into silk he went to see what it could be and he had no sooner viewed it closer than he threw up his hands with rapture it is a seraph he whispered a lovely seraph heaven hath witnessed my bitter trial and approves my cruelty and this flower of the skies is sent to cheer me fainting under my burden he fell on his knees and gazed with ecstasy on its golden hair and its tender skin and cheeks like a peach let me feast my sad eyes on thee ere thou leavest me for thine everblessed abode and my cell darkens again at thy parting as it did at hers with all this the hermit disturbed the lovely visitor he opened wide two eyes the colour of heaven and seeing a strange figure kneeling over him he cried piteously mumma mumma and the tears began to run down his little cheeks perhaps after all clement who for more than six months had not looked on the human face divine estimated childish beauty more justly than we can and in truth this fair northern child with its long golden hair was far more angelic than any of our imagined angels but now the spell was broken yet not unhappily clement it may be remembered was fond of children and true monastic life fosters this sentiment the innocent distress on the cherubic face the tears that ran so smoothly from those transparent violets his eyes and his pretty dismal cry for his only friend his mother went through the hermits heart he employed all his gentleness and all his art to soothe him and as the little soul was wonderfully intelligent for his age presently succeeded so far that he ceased to cry out and wonder took the place of fear while in silence broken only in little gulps he scanned with great tearful eyes this strange figure that looked so wild but spoke so kindly and wore armour yet did not kill little boys but coaxed them clement was equally perplexed to know how this little human flower came to lie sparkling and blooming in his gloomy cave but he remembered he had left the door wide open and he was driven to conclude that owing to this negligence some unfortunate creature of high or low degree had seized this opportunity to get rid of her child for ever at this his bowels yearned so over the poor deserted cherub that the tears of pure tenderness stood in his eyes and still beneath the crime of the mother he saw the divine goodness which had so directed her heartlessness as to comfort his servants breaking heart now bless thee bless thee bless thee sweet innocent i would not change thee for een a cherub in heaven ats pooty replied the infant ignoring contemptuously after the manner of infants all remarks that did not interest him what is pretty here my love besides thee ookumgars said the boy pointing to the hermits breastplate quot liberi tot sententiunculae hectors child screamed at his fathers glittering casque and nodding crest and here was a mediaeval babe charmed with a polished cuirass and his griefs assuaged there are prettier things here than that said clement there are little birds lovest thou birds nay ay en um ittle ery ittle not ike torks hate torks um bigger an baby he then confided in very broken language that the storks with their great flapping wings scared him and were a great trouble and worry to him darkening his existence more or less ay but my birds are very little and good and oh so pretty den i ikes m said the child authoritatively i ont my mammy alas sweet dove i doubt i shall have to fill her place as best i may hast thou no daddy as well as mammy sweet one now not only was this conversation from first to last the relative ages situations and all circumstances of the parties considered as strange a one as ever took place between two mortal creatures but at or within a second or two of the hermits last question to turn the strange into the marvellous came an unseen witness to whom every word that passed carried ten times the force it did to either of the speakers since therefore it is with her eyes you must now see and hear with her ears i go back a step for her margaret when she ran past gerard was almost mad she was in that state of mind in which affectionate mothers have been known to kill their children sometimes along with themselves sometimes alone which last is certainly maniacal she ran to reicht heynes pale and trembling and clasped her round the neck oh reicht oh reicht and could say no more reicht kissed her and began to whimper and would you believe it the great mastiff uttered one long whine even his glimmer of sense taught him grief was afoot oh reicht moaned the despised beauty as soon as she could utter a word for choking see how he has served me and she showed her hands that were bleeding with falling on the stony ground he threw me down he was so eager to fly from me he took me for a devil he said i came to tempt him am i the woman to tempt a man you know me reicht nay in sooth sweet mistress margaret the last i the world and he would not look at my child ill fling myself and him into the rotter this night oh fie fie eh my sweet woman speak not so is any man that breathes worth your childs life my child where is he why reicht i have left him behind oh shame is it possible i can love him to that degree as to forget my child ah i am rightly served for it and she sat down and faithful reicht beside her and they sobbed in one anothers arms after a while margaret left off sobbing and said doggedly let us go home ay but the bairn oh he is well where he is my heart is turned against my very child he cares nought for him wouldnt see him nor hear speak of him and i took him there so proud and made his hair so nice i did and put his new frock and cowl on him nay turn about its his child as well as mine let him keep it awhile mayhap that will learn him to think more of its mother and his own high words off an empty stomach said reicht time will show come you home they departed and time did show quicker than he levels abbeys for at the second step margaret stopped and could neither go one way nor the other but stood stock still reicht said she piteously what else have i on earth i cannot whoever said you could think you i paid attention words are womans breath come back for him without more ado tis time we were in our beds much more he reicht led the way and margaret followed readily enough in that direction but as they drew near the cell she stopped again reicht go you and ask him will he give me back my boy for i could not bear the sight of him alas mistress this do seem a sorry ending after all that hath been betwixt you twain bethink thee now doth thine heart whisper no excuse for him dost verily hate him for whom thou hast waited so long oh weary world hate him reicht i would not harm a hair of his head for all that is in nature but look on him i cannot i have taken a horror of him oh when i think of all i have suffered for him and what i came here this night to do for him and brought my own darling to kiss him and call him father ah luke my poor chap my wound showeth me thine i have thought too little of thy pangs whose true affection i despised and now my own is despised reicht if the poor lad was here now he would have a good chance well he is not far off said reicht heynes but somehow she did not say it with alacrity speak not to me of any man said margaret bitterly i hate them all for the sake of one flout me not but prithee go forward and get me what is my own my sole joy in the world thou knowest i am on thorns till i have him to my bosom again reicht went forward margaret sat by the roadside and covered her face with her apron and rocked herself after the manner of her country for her soul was full of bitterness and grief so severe indeed was the internal conflict that she did not hear reicht running back to her and started violently when the young woman laid a hand upon her shoulder mistress margaret said reicht quietly take a fools advice that loves ye go softly to yon cave wi all the ears and eyes your mother ever gave you why reicht stammered margaret i thought the cave was afire twas so light inside and there were voices voices ay not one but twain and all unlikea mans and a little childs talking as pleasant as you and me i am no great hand at a keyhole for my part tis paltry work but if so be voices were a talking in yon cave and them that owned those voices were so near to me as those are to thee id go on all fours like a fox and id crawl on my belly like a serpent ere id lose one word that passes atwixt those twain whisht reicht bless thee bide thou here buss me pray for me and almost ere the agitated words had left her lips margaret was flying towards the hermitage as noiselessly as a lapwing arrived near it she crouched and there was something truly serpentine in the gliding flexible noiseless movements by which she reached the very door and there she found a chink and listened and often it cost her a struggle not to burst in upon them but warned by defeat she was cautious and resolute let well alone and after a while slowly and noiselessly she reared her head like a snake its crest to where she saw the broadest chink of all and looked with all her eyes and soul as well as listened the little boy then being asked whether he had no daddy at first shook his head and would say nothing but being pressed he suddenly seemed to remember something and said he dadda ill man run away and left poor mumma she who heard this winced it was as new to her as to clement some interfering foolish woman had gone and said this to the boy and now out it came in gerards very face his answer surprised her he burst out the villain the monster he must be born without bowels to desert thee sweet one ah he little knows the joy he has turned his back on well my little dove i must be father and mother to thee since the one runs away and tother abandons thee to my care now tomorrow i shall ask the good people that bring me my food to fetch some nice eggs and milk for thee as well for bread is good enough for poor old goodfornothing me but not for thee and i shall teach thee to read i can yead i can yead ay verily so young all the better we will read good books together and i shall show thee the way to heaven heaven is a beautiful place a thousand times fairer and better than earth and there be little cherubs like thyself in white glad to welcome thee and love thee wouldst like to go to heaven one day ay along wimymammy what not without her then nay i ont my mammy where is my mammy oh what it cost poor margaret not to burst in and clasp him to her heart well fret not sweetheart mayhap she will come when thou art asleep wilt thou be good now and sleep i not eepy ikes to talk well talk we then tell me thy pretty name baby and he opened his eyes with amazement at this great hulking creatures ignorance hast none other nay what shall i do to pleasure thee baby shall i tell thee a story i ikes tories said the boy clapping his hands or sing thee a song i ikes tongs and he became excited choose then a song or a story ting i a tong nay tell i a tory nay ting i a tong nayand the corners of his little mouth turned down and he had half a mind to weep because he could not have both and could not tell which to forego suddenly his little face cleared ting i a tory said he sing thee a story baby well after all why not and wilt thou sit o my knee and hear it yea then i must een doff this breastplate tis too hard for thy soft cheek so and now i must doff this bristly cilice they would prick thy tender skin perhaps make it bleed as they have me i see so and now i put on my best pelisse in honour of thy worshipful visit see how soft and warm it is bless the good soul that sent it and now i sit me down so and i take thee on my left knee and put my arm under thy little head so and then the psaltery and play a little tune so not too loud i ikes dat i am right glad ont now list the story he chanted a childs story in a sort of recitative singing a little moral refrain now and then the boy listened with rapture i ikes oo said he ot is oo is oo a man ay little heart and a great sinner to boot i ikes great tingers ting one other tory story no was chanted i ubbs oo cried the child impetuously ot caft is oo i am a hermit love i ubbs vermins ting other one but during this final performance nature suddenly held out her leaden sceptre over the youthful eyelids i is not eepy whined he very faintly and succumbed clement laid down his psaltery softly and began to rock his new treasure in his arms and to crone over him a little lullaby well known in tergou with which his own mother had often sent him off and the child sank into a profound sleep upon his arm and he stopped croning and gazed on him with infinite tenderness yet sadness for at that moment he could not help thinking what might have been but for a piece of paper with a lie in it he sighed deeply the next moment the moonlight burst into his cell and with it and in it and almost as swift as it margaret brandt was down at his knee with a timorous hand upon his shoulder gerard you do not reject us you cannot more than one hermit had received a present of this kind query looking glass craft he means trade or profession chapter xcv the startled hermit glared from his nurseling to margaret and from her to him in amazement equalled only by his agitation at her so unexpected return the child lay asleep on his left arm and she was at his right knee no longer the pale scared panting girl he had overpowered so easily an hour or two ago but an imperial beauty with blushing cheeks and sparkling eyes and lips sweetly parted in triumph and her whole face radiant with a look he could not quite read for he had never yet seen it on her maternal pride he stared and stared from the child to her in throbbing amazement us he gasped at last and still his wonderstricken eyes turned to and fro margaret was surprised in her turn it was an age of impressions not facts what she cried doth not a father know his own child and a man of god too fie gerard to pretend nay thou art too wise too good not to havewhy i watched thee and een now look at you twain tis thine own flesh and blood thou holdest to thine heart clement trembled what words are these he stammered this angel mine whose else since he is mine clement turned on the sleeping child with a look beyond the power of the pen to describe and trembled all over as his eyes seemed to absorb the little love margarets eyes followed his he is not a bit like me said she proudly but oh at whiles he is thy very image in little and see this golden hair thine was the very colour at his age ask mother else and see this mole on his little finger now look at thine own there twas thy mother let me weet thou wast marked so before him and oh gerard twas this our child found thee for me for by that little mark on thy finger i knew thee for his father when i watched above thy window and saw thee feed the birds here she seized the childs hand and kissed it eagerly and got half of it into her mouth heaven knows how ah bless thee thou didst find thy poor daddy for her and now thou hast made us friends again after our little quarrel the first the last wast very cruel to me but now my poor gerard and i forgive thee for loving of thy child ah ah ah ah ah sobbed clement choking and lowered by fasts and unnerved by solitude the once strong man was hysterical and nearly fainting margaret was alarmed but having experience her pity was greater than her fear nay take not on so she murmured soothingly and put a gentle hand upon his brow be brave so so dear heart thou art not the first man that hath gone abroad and come back richer by a lovely little self than he went forth being a man of god take courage and say he sends thee this to comfort thee for what thou hast lost in me and that is not so very much my lamb for sure the better part of love shall neer cool here to thee though it may in thine and ought being a priest and parson of gouda i priest of gouda never murmured clement in a faint voice i am a friar of st dominic yet speak on sweet music tell me all that has happened thee before we are parted again now some would on this have exclaimed against parting at all and raised the true question in dispute but such women as margaret do not repeat their mistakes it is very hard to defeat them twice where their hearts are set on a thing she assented and turned her back on gouda manse as a thing not to be recurred to and she told him her tale dwelling above all on the kindness to her of his parents and while she related her troubles his hand stole to hers and often she felt him wince and tremble with ire and often press her hand sympathizing with her in every vein oh piteous tale of a true heart battling alone against such bitter odds said he it all seems small when i see thee here again and nursing my boy we have had a warning gerard true friends like you and me are rare and they are mad to part ere death divideth them and that is true said clement off his guard and then she would have him tell her what he had suffered for her and he begged her to excuse him and she consented but by questions quietly revoked her consent and elicited it all and many a sigh she heaved for him and more than once she hid her face in her hands with terror at his perils though past and to console him for all he had gone through she kneeled down and put her arms under the little boy and lifted him gently up kiss him softly she whispered again again kiss thy fill if thou canst he is sound tis all i can do to comfort thee till thou art out of this foul den and in thy sweet manse yonder clement shook his head well said she let that pass know that i have been sore affronted for want of my lines who hath dared affront thee no matter those that will do it again if thou hast lost them which the saints forbid i lose them nay there they lie close to thy hand where where oh where clement hung his head look in the vulgate heaven forgive me i thought thou wert dead and a saint in heaven she looked and on the blank leaves of the poor souls vulgate she found her marriage lines thank god she cried thank god oh bless thee gerard bless thee why what is here gerard on the other leaves were pinned every scrap of paper she had ever sent him and their two names she had once written together in sport and the lock of her hair she had given him and half a silver coin she had broken with him and a straw she had sucked her soup with the first day he ever saw her when margaret saw these proofs of love and signs of a gentle heart bereaved even her exultation at getting back her marriage lines was overpowered by gushing tenderness she almost staggered and her hand went to her bosom and she leaned her brow against the stone cell and wept so silently that he did not see she was weeping indeed she would not let him for she felt that to befriend him now she must be the stronger and emotion weakens gerard said she i know you are wise and good you must have a reason for what you are doing let it seem ever so unreasonable talk we like old friends why are you buried alive margaret to escape temptation my impious ire against those two had its root in the heart that heart then i must deaden and dei gratia i shall shall i a servant of christ and of the church court temptation shall i pray daily to be led out ont and walk into it with open eyes that is good sense anyway said margaret with a consummate affectation of candour tis unanswerable said clement with a sigh we shall see tell me have you escaped temptation here why i ask is when i am alone my thoughts are far more wild and foolish than in company nay speak sooth come i must needs own i have been worse tempted here with evil imaginations than in the world there now ay but so were anthony and jerome macarius and hilarion benedict bernard and all the saints twill wear off how do you know i feel sure it will guessing against knowledge here tis men folk are sillier than us that be but women wise in their own conceits they will not let themselves see their stomachs are too high to be taught by their eyes a woman if she went into a hole in a bank to escape temptation and there found it would just lift her farthingale and out ont and not een know how wise she was till she watched a man in like plight nay i grant humility and a teachable spirit are the roads to wisdom but when all is said here i wrestle but with imagination at gouda she i love as no priest or monk must love any but the angels she will tempt a weak soul unwilling yet not loth to be tempted ay that is another matter i should tempt thee then to what i gods name who knows the flesh is weak speak for yourself my lad why you are thinking of some other margaret not margaret a peter was ever my mind turned to folly and frailty stay is it because you were my husband once as these lines avouch think you the road to folly is beaten for you more than another oh how shallow are the wise and how little able are you to read me who can read you so well from top to toe come learn thine a b c were a stranger to proffer me unchaste love i should shrink a bit no doubt and feel sore but i should defend myself without making a coil for men i know are so the best of them sometimes but if you that have been my husband and are my childs father were to offer to humble me so in mine own eyes and thine and his either i should spit in thy face gerard or as i am not a downright vulgar woman i should snatch the first weapon at hand and strike thee dead and margarets eyes flashed fire and her nostrils expanded that it was glorious to see and no one that did see her could doubt her sincerity i had not the sense to see that said gerard quietly and he pondered margaret eyed him in silence and soon recovered her composure let not you and i dispute said she gently speak we of other things ask me of thy folk my father well and warms to thee and me poor soul a drew glaive on those twain that day but jorian ketel and i we mastered him and he drove them forth his house for ever that may not be he must take them back that he will never do for us you know the man he is dour as iron yet would he do it for one word from one that will not speak it who the vicar of gouda the old man will be at the manse tomorrow i hear how you come back to that forgive me i am but a woman it is us for nagging shouldst keep me from it wi questioning of me my sister kate alas what hath ill befallen een that sweet lily out and alas be calm sweetheart no harm hath her befallen oh nay nay far fro that then margaret forced herself to be composed and in a low sweet gentle voice she murmured to him thus my poor gerard kate hath left her trouble behind her for the manner ont twas like the rest ah such as she saw never thirty nor ever shall while earth shall last she smiled in pain too a well then thus twas she was took wi a languor and a loss of all her pains a loss of her pains i understand you not ay you are not experienced indeed een thy mother almost blinded herself and said tis maybe a change for the better but joan ketel which is an understanding woman she looked at her and said down sun down wind and the gossips sided and said be brave you that are her mother for she is half way to the saints and thy mother wept sore but kate would not let her and one very ancient woman she said to thy mother she will die as easy as she lived hard and she lay painless best part of three days a sipping of heaven aforehand and my dear when she was just parting she asked for gerards little boy and i brought him and set him on the bed and the little thing behaved as peaceably as he does now but by this time she was past speaking but she pointed to a drawer and her mother knew what to look for it was two gold angels thou hadst given her years ago poor soul she had kept then till thou shouldst come home and she nodded towards the little boy and looked anxious but we understood her and put the pieces in his two hands and when his little fingers closed on them she smiled content and so she gave her little earthly treasures to her favourites childfor you were her favouriteand her immortal jewel to god and passed so sweetly we none of us knew justly when she left us welladay welladay gerard wept she hath not left her like on earth he sobbed oh how the affections of earth curl softly round my heart i cannot help it god made them after all speak on sweet margaret at thy voice the past rolls its tides back upon me the loves and the hopes of youth come fair and gliding into my dark cell and darker bosom on waves of memory and music gerard i am loth to grieve you but kate cried a little when she first took ill at you not being there to close her eyes gerard sighed you were within a league but hid your face from her he groaned there forgive me for nagging i am but a woman you would not have been so cruel to your own flesh and blood knowingly would you oh no well then know that thy brother sybrandt lies in my charge with a broken back fruit of thy curse mea culpa mea culpa he is very penitent be yourself and forgive him this night i have forgiven him long ago think you he can believe that from any mouth but yours come he is but about two butts length hence so near why where at gouda manse i took him there yestreen for i know you the curse was scarce cold on your lips when you repented it gerard nodded assent and i said to myself gerard will thank me for taking sybrandt to die under his roof he will not beat his breast and cry mea culpa yet grudge three footsteps to quiet a withered brother on his last bed he may have a bee in his bonnet but he is not a hypocrite a thing all pious words and uncharitable deeds gerard literally staggered where he sat at this tremendous thrust forgive me for nagging said she thy mother too is waiting for thee is it well done to keep her on thorns so long she will not sleep this night bethink thee gerard she is all to thee that i am to this sweet child ah i think so much more of mothers since i had my little gerard she suffered for thee and nursed thee and tended thee from boy to man priest monk hermit call thyself what thou wilt to her thou art but one thing her child where is she murmured gerard in a quavering voice at gouda manse wearing the night in prayer and care then margaret saw the time was come for that appeal to his reason she had purposely reserved till persuasion should have paved the way for conviction so the smith first softens the iron by fire and then brings down the sledge hammer she showed him but in her own good straightforward dutch that his present life was only a higher kind of selfishness spiritual egotism whereas a priest had no more right to care only for his own soul than only for his own body that was not his path to heaven but said she whoever yet lost his soul by saving the souls of others the almighty loves him who thinks of others and when he shall see thee caring for the souls of the folk the duke hath put into thine hand he will care ten times more for thy soul than he does now gerard was struck by this remark art shrewd in dispute said he far from it was the reply only my eyes are not bandaged with conceit so long as satan walks the whole earth tempting men and so long as the sons of belial do never lock themselves in caves but run like ants to and fro corrupting others the good man that skulks apart plays the devils game or at least gives him the odds thou a soldier of christ ask thy comrade denys who is but a soldier of the duke ask him if ever he skulked in a hole and shunned the battle because forsooth in battle is danger as well as glory and duty for thy sole excuse is fear thou makest no secret ont go to no duke nor king hath such cowardly soldiers as christ hath what was that you said in the church at rotterdam about the man in the parable that buried his talent in the earth and so offended the giver thy wonderful gift for preaching is it not a talent and a gift from thy creator certes such as it is and hast thou laid it out or buried it to whom hast thou preached these seven months to bats and owls hast buried it in one hole with thyself and thy once good wits the dominicans are the friars preachers tis for preaching they were founded so thou art false to dominic as well as to his master do you remember gerard when we were young together which now are old before our time as we walked handed in the fields did you but see a sheep cast ay three fields off you would leave your sweetheart by her good will and run and lift the sheep for charity well then at gouda is not one sheep in evil plight but a whole flock some cast some strayed some sick some tainted some a being devoured and all for the want of a shepherd where is their shepherd lurking in a den like a wolf a den in his own parish out fie out fie i scented thee out in part by thy kindness to the little birds take note you gerard eliassoen must love something tis in your blood you were born tot shunning man you do but seek earthly affection a peg lower than man gerard interrupted her the birds are gods creatures his innocent creatures and i do well to love them being gods creatures what are they creatures of the same god that we are that he is who lies upon thy knee you know they are then what pretence for shunning us and being kind to them sith man is one of the animals why pick him out to shun ist because he is of animals the paragon what you court the young of birds and abandon your own young birds need but bodily food and having wings deserve scant pity if they cannot fly and find it but that sweet dove upon thy knee he needeth not carnal only but spiritual food he is thine as well as mine and i have done my share he will soon be too much for me and i look to goudas parson to teach him true piety and useful lore is he not of more value than many sparrows gerard started and stammered an affirmation for she waited for his reply you wonder continued she to hear me quote holy writ so glib i have pored over it this four years and why not because god wrote it but because i saw it often in thy hands ere thou didst leave me heaven forgive me i am but a woman what thinkest thou of this sentence let your work so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven what is a saint in a sink better than a light under a bushel therefore since the sheep committed to thy charge bleat for thee and cry oh desert us no longer but come to gouda manse since i who know thee ten times better than thou knowest thyself do pledge my soul it is for thy souls weal to go to gouda mansesince duty to thy child too long abandoned calls thee to gouda mansesince thy sovereign whom holy writ again bids thee honour sends thee to gouda mansesince the pope whom the church teaches thee to revere hath absolved thee of thy monkish vows and orders thee to gouda manse ah since thy greyhaired mother watches for thee in dole and care and turneth oft the hourglass and sigheth sore that thou comest so slow to her at gouda mansesince thy brother withered by thy curse awaits thy forgiveness and thy prayers for his soul now lingering in his body at gouda mansetake thou in thine arms the sweet bird wi crest of gold that nestles to thy bosom and give me thy hand thy sweetheart erst and wife and now thy friend the truest friend to thee this night that ere man had and come with me to gouda manse it is the voice of an angel cried clement loudly then hearken it and come forth to gouda manse the battle was won margaret lingered behind cast her eye rapidly round the furniture and selected the vulgate and the psaltery the rest she sighed at and let it lie the breastplate and the cilice of bristles she took and dashed with feeble ferocity on the floor then seeing gerard watch her with surprise from the outside she coloured and said i am but a woman little will still be spiteful why encumber thyself with those they are safe oh she had a reason and with this they took the road to gouda parsonage the moon and stars were so bright it seemed almost as light as day suddenly gerard stopped my poor little birds what of them they will miss their food i feed them every day the child hath a piece of bread in his cowl take that and feed them now against the morn i will nay i will not he is as innocent and nearer to me and to thee margaret drew a long breath tis well hadst taken it i might have hated thee i am but a woman when they had gone about a quarter of a mile gerard sighed margaret said he i must een rest he is too heavy for me then give him me and take thou these alas alas i mind when thou wouldst have run with the child on one shoulder and the mother on tother and margaret carried the boy i trow said gerard looking down overmuch fasting is not good for a man a many die of it each year winter time replied margaret gerard pondered these simple words and eyed her askant carrying the child with perfect ease when they had gone nearly a mile he said with considerable surprise you thought it was but two butts length not i why you said so that is another matter she then turned on him the face of a madonna i lied said she sweetly and to save your soul and body id maybe tell a worse lie than that at need i am but a woman ah well it is but two butts length from here at any rate without a lie humph three without a lie and sure enough in a few minutes they came up to the manse a candle was burning in the vicars parlour she is waking still whispered margaret beautiful beautiful said clement and stopped to look at it what in heavens name that little candle seen through the window at night look an it be not like some fair star of size prodigious it delighteth the eyes and warmeth the heart of those outside come and ill show thee something better said margaret and led him on tiptoe to the window they looked in and there was catherine kneeling on the hassock with her hours before her folk can pray out of a cave whispered margaret ay and hit heaven with their prayers for tis for a sight of thee she prayeth and thou art here now gerard be prepared she is not the woman you knew her her childrens troubles have greatly broken the brisk lighthearted soul and i see she has been weeping een now she will have given thee up being so late let me get to her said clement hastily trembling all over that door i will bide here when gerard was gone to the door margaret fearing the sudden surprise gave one sharp tap at the window and cried mother in a loud expressive voice that catherine read at once she clasped her hands together and had half risen from her kneeling posture when the door burst open and clement flung himself wildly on his knees at her knees with his arms out to embrace her she uttered a cry such as only a mother could ah my darling my darling and clung sobbing round his neck and true it was she saw neither a hermit a priest nor a monk but just her child lost and despaired of and in her arms and after a little while margaret came in with wet eyes and cheeks and a holy calm of affection settled by degrees on these sore troubled ones and they sat all three together hand in hand murmuring sweet and loving converse and he who sat in the middle drank right and left their true affection and their humble but genuine wisdom and was forced to eat a good nourishing meal and at daybreak was packed off to a snowy bed and by and by awoke as from a hideous dream friar and hermit no more clement no more but gerard eliassoen parson of gouda i think she means prejudice chapter xcvi margaret went back to rotterdam long ere gerard awoke and actually left her boy behind her she sent the faithful sturdy reicht off to gouda directly with a vicars grey frock and large felt hat and with minute instructions how to govern her new master then she went to jorian ketel for she said to herself he is the closest i ever met so he is the man for me and in concert with him she did two mortal sly things yet not in my opinion virulent though she thought they were but if i am asked what were these deeds without a name the answer is that as she who was but a woman kept them secret till her dying day i who am a manverbum non amplius addam she kept away from gouda parsonage things that pass little noticed in the heat of argument sometimes rankle afterwards and when she came to go over all that had passed she was offended at gerard thinking she could ever forget the priest in the some time lover for what did he take me said she and this raised a great shyness which really she would not otherwise have felt being downright innocent and pride sided with modesty and whispered go no more to gouda parsonage she left little gerard there to complete the conquest her maternal heart ascribed to him not to her own eloquence and sagacity and to anchor his father for ever to humanity but this generous stroke of policy cost her heart dear she had never yet been parted from her boy an hour and she felt sadly strange as well as desolate without him after the first day it became intolerable and what does the poor soul do but creep at dark up to gouda parsonage and lurk about the premises like a thief till she saw reicht heynes in the kitchen alone then she tapped softly at the window and said reicht for pitys sake bring him out to me unbeknown with margaret the person who occupied her thoughts at the time ceased to have a name and sank to a pronoun reicht soon found an excuse for taking little gerard out and there was a scene of mutual rapture followed by mutual tears when mother and boy parted again and it was arranged that reicht should take him half way to rotterdam every day at a set hour and margaret meet them and at these meetings after the raptures and after mother and child had gambolled together like a young cat and her first kitten the boy would sometimes amuse himself alone at their feet and the two women generally seized this opportunity to talk very seriously about luke peterson this began thus reicht said margaret i as good as promised him to marry luke peterson say you the word quoth i and ill wed him poor luke prithee why poor luke to be bandied about so atwixt yea and nay why reicht you have not ever been so simple as to cast an eye of affection on the boy that you take his part me said reicht with a toss of the head oh i ask your pardon well then you can do me a good turn whisht whisper that little darling is listening to every word and eyes like saucers on this both their heads would have gone under one cap two women plotting against one boy oh you great cowardly serpents but when these stolen meetings had gone on for about five days margaret began to feel the injustice of it and to be irritated as well as unhappy and she was crying about it when a cart came to her door and in it clean as a new penny his beard close shaved his hands white as snow and a little colour in his pale face sat the vicar of gouda in the grey frock and large felt hat she had sent him she ran upstairs directly and washed away all traces of her tears and put on a cap which being just taken out of the drawer was cleaner theoretically than the one she had on and came down to him he seized both her hands and kissed them and a tear fell upon them she turned her head away at that to hide her own which started my sweet margaret he cried why is this why hold you aloof from your own good deed we have been waiting for you every day and no margaret you said things what when i was a hermit and a donkey ay no matter you said things and you had no reason forget all i said there who hearkens the ravings of a maniac for i see now that in a few months more i should have been a gibbering idiot yet no mortal could have persuaded me away but you oh what an outlay of wit and goodness was yours but it is not here i can thank and bless you as i ought no it is in the home you have given me among the sheep whose shepherd you have made me already i love them dearly there it is i must thank the truest friend ever man had so now i say to you as erst you said to me come to gouda manse humph we will see about that why margaret think you i had ever kept the dear child so long but that i made sure you would be back to him from day to day oh he curls round my very heartstrings but what is my title to him compared to thine confess now thou hast had hard thoughts of me for this nay nay not i ah thou art thyself again wast ever thoughtful of others i have half a mind to go to gouda manse for your saying that come then with half thy mind tis worth the whole of other folks well i dare say i will but there is no such mighty hurry said she coolly she was literally burning to go tell me first how you agree with your folk why already my poor have taken root in my heart i thought as much and there are such good creatures among them simple and rough and superstitious but wonderfully good oh i leave you alone for seeing a grain of good among a bushel of ill whisht whisht and margaret two of them have been ill friends for four years and came to the manse each to get on my blind side but give the glory to god i got on their bright side and made them friends and laugh at themselves for their folly but are you in very deed their vicar answer me that certes have i not been to the bishop and taken the oath and rung the church bell and touched the altar the missal and the holy cup before the churchwardens and they have handed me the parish seal see here it is nay tis a real vicar inviting a true friend to gouda manse then my mind is at ease tell me oceans more well sweet one nearest to me of all my parish is a poor cripple that my guardian angel and his her name thou knowest even by this turning of thy head away hath placed beneath my roof sybrandt and i are that we never were till now brothers twould gladden thee yet sadden thee to hear how we kissed and forgave one another he is full of thy praises and wholly in a pious mind he says he is happier since his trouble than eer he was in the days of his strength oh out of my house he neer shall go to any place but heaven tell me somewhat that happened thyself poor soul all this is good but yet no tidings to me do i not know thee of old well let me see at first i was much dazzled by the sunlight and could not go abroad owl but that is passed and good reicht heyneshumph what of her this to thine ear only for she is a diamond her voice goes through me like a knife and all voices seem loud but thine which is so mellow sweet stay now ill fit ye with tidings i spake yesterday with an old man that conceits he is illtempered and sweats to pass for such with others but oh so threadbare and the best good heart beneath why tis a parish of angels said margaret ironically then why dost thou keep out ont retorted gerard well he was telling me there was no parish in holland where the devil hath such power as at gouda and among his instances says he we had a hermit the holiest in holland but being gouda the devil came for him this week and took him bag and baggage not a haporth of him left but a goodish piece of his skin just for all the world like a hedgehogs and a piece o old iron furbished up margaret smiled ay but continued gerard the strange thing is the cave has verily fallen in and had i been so perverse as resist thee it had assuredly buried me dead there where i had buried myself alive therefore in this i see the finger of providence condemning my late approving my present way of life what sayest thou nay can i pierce the like mysteries i am but a woman somewhat more methinks this very tale proves thee my guardian angel and all else avouches it so come to gouda manse well go you on ill follow nay in the cart with me not so why can i tell why and wherefore being a woman all i know is i seemto feelto wishto come alone so be it then i leave thee the cart being as thou sayest a woman and ill go afoot being a man again with the joyful tidings of thy coming when margaret reached the manse the first thing she saw was the two gerards together the son performing his capriccios on the plot and the father slouching on a chair in his great hat with pencil and paper trying very patiently to sketch him after a warm welcome he showed her his attempts but in vain i strive to fix him said he for he is incarnate quick silver yet do but note his changes infinite but none ungracious all is supple and easy and how he melteth from one posture to another he added presently woe to illuminators i looking on thee sir baby i see what awkward lopsided ungainly toads i and my fellows painted missals with and called them cherubs and seraphs finally he threw the paper away in despair and margaret conveyed it secretly into her bosom at night when they sat round the peat fire he bade them observe how beautiful the brass candlesticks and other glittering metals were in the glow from the hearth catherines eyes sparkled at this observation and oh the sheets i lie in here said he often my conscience pricketh me and saith who art thou to lie in lint like web of snow dives was neer so flaxed as i and to think that there are folk in the world that have all the beautiful things which i have here yet not content let them pass six months in a hermits cell seeing no face of man then will they find how lovely and pleasant this wicked world is and eke that men and women are gods fairest creatures margaret was always fair but never to my eye so bright as now margaret shook her head incredulously gerard continued my mother was ever good and kind but i noted not her exceeding comeliness till now nor i neither said catherine a score years ago i might pass in a crowd but not now gerard declared to her that each age had its beauty see this mild grey eye said he that hath looked motherly love upon so many of us all that love hath left its shadow and that shadow is a beauty which defieth time see this delicate lip these pure white teeth see this wellshaped brow where comliness just passeth into reverence art beautiful in my eyes mother dear and that is enough for me my darling tis time you were in bed child ye have to preach the morn and reicht heynes and catherine interchanged a look which said we two have an amiable maniac to superintend calls everything beautiful the next day was sunday and they heard him preach in his own church it was crammed with persons who came curious but remained devout never was his wonderful gift displayed more powerfully he was himself deeply moved by the first sight of all his people and his bowels yearned over this flock he had so long neglected in a single sermon which lasted two hours and seemed to last but twenty minutes he declared the whole scripture he terrified the impenitent and thoughtless confirmed the wavering consoled the bereaved and the afflicted uplifted the heart of the poor and when he ended left the multitude standing rapt and unwilling to believe the divine music of his voice and soul had ceased need i say that two poor women in a corner sat entranced with streaming eyes wherever gat he it all whispered catherine with her apron to her eyes by our lady not from me as soon as they were by themselves margaret threw her arms round catherines neck and kissed her mother mother i am not quite a happy woman but oh i am a proud one and she vowed on her knees never by word or deed to let her love come between this young saint and heaven reader did you ever stand by the seashore after a storm when the wind happens to have gone down suddenly the waves cannot cease with their cause indeed they seem at first to the ear to lash the sounding shore more fiercely than while the wind blew still we are conscious that inevitable calm has begun and is now but rocking them to sleep so it was with those true and tempesttossed lovers from that eventful night when they went hand in hand beneath the stars from gouda hermitage to gouda manse at times a loud wave would every now and then come roaring but it was only memorys echo of the tempest that had swept their lives the storm itself was over and the boiling waters began from that moment to go down down down gently but inevitably this image is to supply the place of interminable details that would be tedious and tame what best merits attention at present is the general situation and the strange complication of feeling that arose from it history itself though a far more daring storyteller than romance presents few things so strange as the footing on which gerard and margaret now lived for many years united by present affection past familiarity and a marriage irregular but legal separated by holy church and by their own consciences which sided unreservedly with holy church separated by the church but united by a living pledge of affection lawful in every sense at its date and living but a few miles from one another and she calling his mother mother for some years she always took her boy to gouda on sunday returning home at dark go when she would it was always fete at gouda manse and she was received like a little queen catherine in these days was nearly always with her and eli very often tergou had so little to tempt them compared with rotterdam and at last they left it altogether and set up in the capital and thus the years glided so barren now of striking incidents so void of great hopes and free from great fears and so like one another that without the help of dates i could scarcely indicate the progress of time however early next year the duchess of burgundy with the open dissent but secret connivance of the duke raised forces to enable her dethroned brother edward the fourth of england to invade that kingdom our old friend denys thus enlisted and passing through rotterdam to the ships heard on his way that gerard was a priest and margaret alone on this he told margaret that marriage was not a habit of his but that as his comrade had put it out of his own power to keep troth he felt bound to offer to keep it for him for a comrades honour is dear to us as our own said he she stared then smiled i choose rather to be still thy shecomrade said she closer acquainted we might not agree so well and in her character of shecomrade she equipped him with a new sword of antwerp make and a double handful of silver i give thee no gold said she for tis thrown away as quick as silver and harder to win back heaven send thee safe out of all thy perils there be famous fair women yonder to beguile thee with their faces as well as men to hash thee with their axes he was hurried on board at la vere and never saw gerard at that time in sybrandt began to fail his pitiable existence had been sweetened by his brothers inventive tenderness and his own contented spirit which his antecedents considered was truly remarkable as for gerard the day never passed that he did not devote two hours to him reading or singing to him praying with him and drawing him about in a soft carriage margaret and he had made between them when the poor soul found his end near he begged margaret might be sent for she came at once and almost with his last breath he sought once more that forgiveness she had long ago accorded she remained by him till the last and he died blessing and blessed in the arms of the two true lovers he had parted for life tantum religio scit suadere boni there was a wedding in margarets house luke peterson and reicht heynes this may seem less strange if i give the purport of the dialogue interrupted some time back margaret went on to say then in that case you can easily make him fancy you and for my sake you must for my conscience it pricketh me and i must needs fit him with a wife the best i know margaret then instructed reicht to be always kind and goodhumoured to luke and she would be a model of peevishness to him but be not thou so simple as run me down said she leave that to me make thou excuses for me i will make myself black enow reicht received these instructions like an order to sweep a room and obeyed them punctually when they had subjected poor luke to this double artillery for a couple of years he got to look upon margaret as his fog and wind and reicht as his sunshine and his affections transferred themselves he scarce knew how or when on the wedding day reicht embraced margaret and thanked her almost with tears he was always my fancy said she from the first hour i clapped eyes on him heyday you never told me that what reicht are you as sly as the rest nay nay said reicht eagerly but i never thought you would really part with him to me in my country the mistress looks to be served before the maid margaret settled them in her shop and gave them half the profits and were years of great trouble to gerard whose conscience compelled him to oppose the pope his holiness siding with the grey friars in their determination to swamp every palpable distinction between the virgin mary and her son bribed the christian world into his crotchet by proffering pardon of all sins to such as would add to the ave mary this clause and blessed be thy mother anna from whom without blot of sin proceeded thy virgin flesh gerard in common with many of the northern clergy held this sentence to be flat heresy he not only refused to utter it in his church but warned his parishioners against using it in private and he refused to celebrate the new feast the pope invented at the same time viz the feast of the miraculous conception of the virgin but this drew upon him the bitter enmity of the franciscans and they were strong enough to put him into more than one serious difficulty and inflict many a little mortification on him in emergencies he consulted margaret and she always did one of two things either she said i do not see my way and refused to guess or else she gave him advice that proved wonderfully sagacious he had genius but she had marvellous tact and where affection came in and annihilated the womans judgment he stepped in his turn to her aid thus though she knew she was spoiling little gerard and catherine was ruining him for life she would not part with him but kept him at home and his abilities uncultivated and there was a shrewd boy of nine years instead of learning to work and obey playing about and learning selfishness from their infinite unselfishness and tyrannizing with a rod of iron over two women both of them sagacious and spirited but reduced by their fondness for him to the exact level of idiots gerard saw this with pain and interfered with mild but firm remonstrance and after a considerable struggle prevailed and got little gerard sent to the best school in europe kept by one haaghe at deventer this was in many tears were shed but the great progress the boy made at that famous school reconciled margaret in some degree and the fidelity of reicht heynes now her partner in business enabled her to spend weeks at a time hovering over her boy at deventer and so the years glided and these two persons subjected to as strong and constant a temptation as can well be conceived were each others guardian angels and not each others tempters to be sure the wellgreased morality of the next century which taught that solemn vows to god are sacred in proportion as they are reasonable had at that time entered no single mind and the alternative to these two minds was selfdenial or sacrilege it was a strange thing to hear them talk with unrestrained tenderness to one another of their boy and an icy barrier between themselves all the time eight years had now passed thus and gerard fairly compared with men in general was happy but margaret was not the habitual expression of her face was a sweet pensiveness but sometimes she was irritable and a little petulant she even snapped gerard now and then and when she went to see him if a monk was with him she would turn her back and go home she hated the monks for having parted gerard and her and she inoculated her boy with a contempt for them which lasted him till his dying day gerard bore with her like an angel he knew her heart of gold and hoped this ill gust would blow over he himself being now the right man in the right place this many years loving his parishioners and beloved by them and occupied from morn till night in good works recovered the natural cheerfulness of his disposition to tell the truth a part of his jocoseness was a blind he was the greatest peacemaker except mr harmony in the play that ever was born he reconciled more enemies in ten years than his predecessors had done in three hundred and one of his manoeuvres in the peacemaking art was to make the quarrellers laugh at the cause of quarrel so did he undermine the demon of discord but independently of that he really loved a harmless joke he was a wonderful tamer of animals squirrels bares fawns etc so half in jest a parishioner who had a mule supposed to be possessed with a devil gave it him and said tame this vagabone parson if ye can well in about six months heaven knows how he not only tamed jack but won his affections to such a degree that jack would come running to his whistle like a dog one day having taken shelter from a shower on the stone settle outside a certain publichouse he heard a toper inside a stranger boasting he could take more at a draught than any man in gouda he instantly marched in and said what lads do none of ye take him up for the honour of gouda shall it be said that there came hither one from another parish a greater sot than any of us nay then i your parson do take him up go to ill find thee a parishioner shall drink more at a draught than thou a bet was made gerard whistled in clattered jackfor he was taught to come into a room with the utmost composureand put his nose into his backers hand a pair of buckets shouted gerard and let us see which of these two sons of asses can drink most at a draught on another occasion two farmers had a dispute whose hay was the best failing to convince each other they said well ask parson for by this time he was their referee in every mortal thing how lucky you thought of me said gerard why i have got one staying with me who is the best judge of hay in holland bring me a double handful apiece so when they came he had them into the parlour and put each bundle on a chair then he whistled and in walked jack lord a mercy said one of the farmers jack said the parson in the tone of conversation just tell us which is the best hay of these two jack sniffed them both and made his choice directly proving his sincerity by eating every morsel the farmers slapped their thighs and scratched their heads to think of we not thinking o that and they each sent jack a truss so gerard got to be called the merry parson of gouda but margaret who like most loving women had no more sense of humour than a turtledove took this very ill what said she to herself is there nothing sore at the bottom of his heart that he can go about playing the zany she could understand pious resignation and content but not mirth in true lovers parted and whilst her womans nature was perturbed by this gust and women seem more subject to gusts than men came that terrible animal a busybody to work upon her catherine saw she was not happy and said to her your boy is gone from you i would not live alone all my days if i were you he is more alone than i sighed margaret oh a man is a man but a woman is a woman you must not think all of him and none of yourself near is your kirtle but nearer is your smock besides he is a priest and can do no better but you are not a priest he has got his parish and his heart is in that bethink thee time flies overstay not thy market wouldst not like to have three or four more little darlings about thy knee now they have robbed thee of poor little gerard and sent him to yon nasty school and so she worked upon a mind already irritated margaret had many suitors ready to marry her at a word or even a look and among them two merchants of the better class van schelt and oostwagen take one of those two said catherine well i will ask gerard if i may said margaret one day with a flood of tears for i cannot go on the way i am why you would never be so simple as ask him think you i would be so wicked as marry without his leave accordingly she actually went to gouda and after hanging her head and blushing and crying and saying she was miserable told him his mother wished her to marry one of those two and if he approved of her marrying at all would he use his wisdom and tell her which he thought would be the kindest to the little gerard of those two for herself she did not care what became of her gerard felt as if she had put a soft hand into his body and torn his heart out with it but the priest with a mighty effort mastered the man in a voice scarcely audible he declined this responsibility i am not a saint or a prophet said he i might advise thee ill i shall read the marriage service for thee faltered he it is my right no other would pray for thee as i should but thou must choose for thyself and oh let me see thee happy this four months past thou hast not been happy a discontented mind is never happy said margaret she left him and he fell on his knees and prayed for help from above margaret went home pale and agitated mother said she never mention it to me again or we shall quarrel he forbade you well more shame for him that is all he forbid me he did not condescend so far he was as noble as i was paltry he would not choose for me for fear of choosing me an ill husband but he would read the service for my groom and me that was his right oh mother what a heartless creature i was well i thought not he had that much sense ah you go by the poor souls words but i rate words as air when the face speaketh to mine eye i saw the priest and the true lover afighting in his dear face and his cheek pale with the strife and oh his poor lip trembled as he said the stouthearted wordsoh oh oh oh oh oh oh and margaret burst into a violent passion of tears catherine groaned there give it up without more ado said she you two are chained together for life and if god is merciful that wont be for long for what are you neither maid wife nor widow give it up said margaret that was done long ago all i think of now is comforting him for now i have been and made him unhappy too wretch and monster that i am so the next day they both went to gouda and gerard who had been praying for resignation all this time received her with peculiar tenderness as a treasure he was to lose but she was agitated and eager to let him see without words that she would never marry and she fawned on him like a little dog to be forgiven and as she was going away she murmured forgive and forget i am but a woman he misunderstood her and said all i bargain for is let me see thee content for pitys sake let me not see thee unhappy as i have this while my darling you never shall again said margaret with streaming eyes and kissed his hand he misunderstood this too at first but when month after month passed and he heard no more of her marriage and she came to gouda comparatively cheerful and was even civil to father ambrose a mild benevolent monk from the dominican convent hard bythen he understood her and one day he invited her to walk alone with him in the sacred paddock and before i relate what passed between them i must give its history when gerard had been four or five days at the manse looking out of window he uttered an exclamation of joy mother margaret here is one of my birds another another four six nine a miracle a miracle why how can you tell your birds from their fellows said catherine i know every feather in their wings and see there is the little darling whose claw i gilt bless it and presently his rapture took a serious turn and he saw heavens approbation in this conduct of the birds as he did in the fall of the cave this wonderfully kept alive his friendship for animals and he enclosed a paddock and drove all the sons of cain from it with threats of excommunication on this little spot of earth well have no murder said he he tamed leverets and partridges and little birds and hares and roedeer he found a squirrel with a broken leg he set it with infinite difficulty and patience and during the cure showed it repositories of acorns nuts chestnuts etc and this squirrel got well and went off but visited him in hard weather and brought a mate and next year little squirrels were found to have imbibed their parents sentiments and of all these animals each generation was tamer than the last this set the good parson thinking and gave him the true clue to the great successes of mediaeval hermits in taming wild animals he kept the key of this paddock and never let any man but himself enter it nor would he even let little gerard go there without him or margaret children are all little cains said he in this oasis then he spoke to margaret and said dear margaret i have thought more than ever of thee of late and have asked myself why i am content and thou unhappy because thou art better wiser holier than i that is all said margaret promptly our lives tell another tale said gerard thoughtfully i know thy goodness and thy wisdom too well to reason thus perversely also i know that i love thee as dear as thou i think lovest me yet am i happier than thou why is this so dear gerard i am as happy as a woman can hope to be this side of the grave not so happy as i now for the reason first then i am a priest and this the one great trial and disappointment god giveth me along with so many joys why i share it with a multitude for alas i am not the only priest by thousands that must never hope for entire earthly happiness here then thy lot is harder than mine but gerard i have my child to love thou canst not fill thy heart with him as his mother can so you may set this against you and i have taen him from thee it was cruel but he would have broken thy heart one day if i had not well then sweet one i come to where the shoe pincheth methinks i have my parish and it keeps my heart in a glow from morn till night there is scarce an emotion that my folk stir not up in me many times a day often their sorrows make me weep sometimes their perversity kindles a little wrath and their absurdity makes me laugh and sometimes their flashes of unexpected goodness do set me all of a glow and i could hug em meantime thou poor soul sittest with heart of lead gerard of very lead see now how unkind thy lot compared with mine now how if thou couldst be persuaded to warm thyself at the fire that warmeth me ah if i could hast but to will it come among my folk take in thine hand the alms i set aside and give it with kind words hear their sorrows they shall show you life is full of troubles and as thou sayest truly no man or woman without their thorn this side the grave indoors i have a map of gouda parish not to oerburden thee at first i will put twenty housen under thee with their folk what sayest thou but for thy wisdom i had died a dirty maniac and neer seen gouda manse nor pious peace wilt profit in turn by what little wisdom i have to soften her lot to whom i do owe all margaret assented warmly and a happy thing it was for the little district assigned to her it was as if an angel had descended on them her fingers were never tired of knitting or cutting for them her heart of sympathizing with them and that heart expanded and waved its drooping wings and the glow of good and gentle deed began to spread over it and she was rewarded in another way by being brought into more contact with gerard and also with his spirit all this time malicious tongues had not been idle if there is nought between them more than meets the eye why doth she not marry etc and i am sorry to say our old friend joan ketel was one of these coarse sceptics and now one winter evening she got on a hot scent she saw margaret and gerard talking earnestly together on the boulevard she whipped behind a tree now ill hear something said she and so she did it was winter there had been one of those tremendous floods followed by a sharp frost and gerard in despair as to where he should lodge forty or fifty houseless folk out of the piercing cold and now it was oh dear dear margaret what shall i do the manse is full of them and a sharp frost coming on this night margaret reflected and joan listened you must lodge them in the church said margaret quietly in the church profanation no charity profanes nothing not even a church soils nought not even a church today is but tuesday go save their lives for a bitter night is coming take thy stove into the church and there house them we will dispose of them here and there ere the lords day and i could not think of that bless thee sweet margaret thy mind is stronger than mine and readier nay nay a woman looks but a little way therefore she sees clear ill come over myself tomorrow and on this they parted with mutual blessings joan glided home remorseful and after that she used to check all surmises to their discredit beware she would say lest some angel should blister thy tongue gerard and margaret paramours i tell ye they are two saints which meet in secret to plot charity to the poor in the summer of gerard determined to provide against similar disasters recurring to his poor accordingly he made a great hole in his income and bled his friends zealous parsons always do that to build a large xenodochium to receive the victims of flood or fire giles and all his friends were kind but all was not enough when lo the dominican monks of gouda to whom his parlour and heart had been open for years came out nobly and put down a handsome sum to aid the charitable vicar the dear good souls said margaret who would have thought it any one who knows them said gerard who more charitable than monks go to they do but give the laity back a pig of their own sow and what more do i what more doth the duke then the ambitious vicar must build almshouses for decayed true men in their old age close to the manse that he might keep and feed them as well as lodge them and his money being gone he asked margaret for a few thousand bricks and just took off his coat and turned builder and as he had a good head and the strength of a hercules with the zeal of an artist up rose a couple of almshouses parson built and at this work margaret would sometimes bring him his dinner and add a good bottle of rhenish and once seeing him run up a plank with a wheelbarrow full of bricks which really most bricklayers would have gone staggering under she said times are changed since i had to carry little gerard for thee ay dear one thanks to thee when the first home was finished the question was who they should put into it and being fastidious over it like a new toy there was much hesitation but an old friend arrived in time to settle this question as gerard was passing a publichouse in rotterdam one day he heard a wellknown voice he looked up and there was denys of burgundy but sadly changed his beard stained with grey and his clothes worn and ragged he had a cuirass still and gauntlets but a staff instead of an arbalest to the company he appeared to be bragging and boasting but in reality he was giving a true relation of edward the fourths invasion of an armed kingdom with men and his march through the country with armies capable of swallowing him looking on his battles at tewkesbury and barnet and reoccupation of his capital and kingdom in three months after landing at the humber with a mixed handful of dutch english and burgundians in this the greatest feat of arms the century had seen denys had shone and whilst sneering at the warlike pretensions of charles the bold a duke with an itch but no talent for fighting and proclaiming the english king the first captain of the age did not forget to exalt himself gerard listened with eyes glittering affection and fun and now said denys after all these feats patted on the back by the gallant young prince of gloucester and smiled on by the great captain himself here i am lamed for life by what by the kick of a horse and this night i know not where i shall lay my tired bones i had a comrade once in these parts that would not have let me lie far from him but he turned priest and deserted his sweetheart so tis not likely he would remember his comrade and ten years play sad havoc with our hearts and limbs and all poor denys sighed and gerards bowels yearned over him what words are these he said with a great gulp in his throat who grudges a brave soldier supper and bed come home with me much obliged but i am no lover of priests nor i of soldiers but what is supper and bed between two true men not much to you but something to me i will come in one hour said gerard and went in high spirits to margaret and told her the treat in store and she must come and share it she must drive his mother in his little carriage up to the manse with all speed and make ready an excellent supper then he himself borrowed a cart and drove denys up rather slowly to give the women time on the road denys found out this priest was a kind soul so told him his trouble and confessed his heart was pretty near broken the great use our stout hearts and arms and lives till we are worn out and then fling us away like broken tools he sighed deeply and it cost gerard a great struggle not to hug him then and there and tell him but he wanted to do it all like a story book who has not had this fancy once in his life why joseph had it all the better for us they landed at the little house it was as clean as a penny the hearth blazing and supper set denys brightened up is this your house reverend sir well tis my work and with these hands but tis your house ah no such luck said denys with a sigh but i say ay shouted gerard and what is more i gulp say gulp courage camarade le diable est mort denys started and almost staggered why what he stammered wwhwho art thou that bringest me back the merry words and merry days of my youth and he was greatly agitated my poor denys i am one whose face is changed but nought else to my heart dear trusty comrade to my heart and he opened his arms with the tears in his eyes but denys came close to him and peered in his face and devoured every feature and when he was sure it was really gerard he uttered a cry so vehement it brought the women running from the house and fell upon gerards neck and kissed him again and again and sank on his knees and laughed and sobbed with joy so terribly that gerard mourned his folly in doing dramas but the women with their gentle soothing ways soon composed the brave fellow and he sat smiling and holding margarets hand and gerards and they all supped together and went to their beds with hearts warm as a toast and the broken soldier was at peace and in his own house and under his comrades wing his natural gaiety returned and he resumed his consigne after eight years disuse and hobbled about the place enlivening it but offended the parish mortally by calling the adored vicar comrade and nothing but comrade when they made a fuss about this to gerard he just looked in their faces and said what does it matter break him of swearing and you shall have my thanks this year margaret went to a lawyer to make her will for without this she was told her boy might have trouble some day to get his own not being born in lawful wedlock the lawyer however in conversation expressed a different opinion this is the babble of churchmen said he yours is a perfect marriage though an irregular one he then informed her that throughout europe excepting only the southern part of britain there were three irregular marriages the highest of which was hers viz a betrothal before witnesses this said he if not followed by matrimonial intercourse is a marriage complete in form but incomplete in substance a person so betrothed can forbid any other banns to all eternity it has however been set aside where a party so betrothed contrived to get married regularly and children were born thereafter but such a decision was for the sake of the offspring and of doubtful justice however in your case the birth of your child closes that door and your marriage is complete both in form and substance your course therefore is to sue for your conjugal rights it will be the prettiest case of the century the law is all on our side the church all on theirs if you come to that the old batavian law which compelled the clergy to marry hath fallen into disuse but was never formally repealed margaret was quite puzzled what are you driving at sir who am i to go to law with who is the defendant why the vicar of gouda alas poor soul and for what shall i law him why to make him take you into his house and share bed and board with you to be sure margaret turned red as fire gramercy for your rede said she what is yon a womans part constrain a man to be hers by force that is mens way of wooing not ours say i were so ill a woman as ye think me i should set myself to beguile him not to law him and she departed crimson with shame and indignation there is an impracticable fool for you said the man of art margaret had her will drawn elsewhere and made her boy safe from poverty marriage or no marriage these are the principal incidents that in ten whole years befell two peaceful lives which in a much shorter period had been so thronged with adventures and emotions their general tenor was now peace piety the mild content that lasts not the fierce bliss ever on tiptoe to depart and above all christian charity on this sacred ground these two true lovers met with an uniformity and a kindness of sentiment which went far to soothe the wound in their own hearts to pity the same bereaved to hunt in couples all the ills in gouda and contrive and scheme together to remedy all that were remediable to use the rare insight into troubled hearts which their own troubles had given them and use it to make others happier than themselvesthis was their daily practice and in this blessed cause their passions for one another cooled a little but their affection increased from this time margaret entered heart and soul into gerards pious charities that affection purged itself of all mortal dross and as it had now long outlived scandal and misapprehension one would have thought that so bright an example of pure selfdenying affection was to remain long before the world to show men how nearly religious faith even when not quite reasonable and religious charity which is always reasonable could raise two true lovers hearts to the loving hearts of the angels of heaven but the great disposer of events ordered otherwise little gerard rejoiced both his parents hearts by the extraordinary progress he made at alexander haaghes famous school at deventer the last time margaret returned from visiting him she came to gerard flushed with pride oh gerard he will be a great man one day thanks to thy wisdom in taking him from us silly women a great scholar one zinthius came to see the school and judge the scholars and didnt our gerard stand up and not a line in horace or terence could zinthius cite but the boy would follow him with the rest why tis a prodigy says that great scholar and there was his poor mother stood by and heard it and he took our gerard in his arms and kissed him and what think you he said nay i know not holland will hear of thee one day and not holland only but all the world why what a sad brow sweet one i am as glad as thou yet am i uneasy to hear the child is wise before his time i love him dear but he is thine idol and heaven doth often break our idols make thy mind easy said margaret heaven will never rob me of my child what i was to suffer in this world i have suffered for if any ill happened my child or thee i should not live a week the lord he knows this and he will leave me my boy a month had elapsed after this but margarets words were yet ringing in his ears when going on his daily round of visits to his poor he was told quite incidentally and as mere gossip that the plague was at deventer carried thither by two sailors from hamburgh his heart turned cold within him news did not gallop in those days the fatal disease must have been there a long time before the tidings would reach gouda he sent a line by a messenger to margaret telling her that he was gone to fetch little gerard to stay at the manse a little while and would she see a bed prepared for he should be back next day and so he hoped she would not hear a word of the danger till it was all happily over he borrowed a good horse and scarce drew rein till he reached deventer quite late in the afternoon he went at once to the school the boy had been taken away as he left the school he caught sight of margarets face at the window of a neighbouring house she always lodged at when she came to deventer he ran hastily to scold her and pack both her and the boy out of the place to his surprise the servant told him with some hesitation that margaret had been there but was gone gone woman said gerard indignantly art not ashamed to say so why i saw her but now at the window oh if you saw her a sweet voice above said stay him not let him enter it was margaret gerard ran up the stairs to her and went to take her hand she drew back hastily he looked astounded i am displeased she said coldly what makes you here know you not the plague is in the town ay dear margaret and came straightway to take our boy away what had he no mother how you speak to me i hoped you knew not what think you i leave my boy unwatched i pay a trusty woman that notes every change in his cheek when i am not here and lets me know i am his mother where is he in rotterdam i hope ere this thank heaven and why are you not there i am not fit for the journey never heed me go you home on the instant ill follow for shame of you to come here risking your precious life it is not so precious as thine said gerard but let that pass we will go home together and on the instant nay i have some matters to do in the town go thou at once and i will follow forthwith leave thee alone in a plaguestricken town to whom speak you dear margaret nay then we shall quarrel gerard methinks i see margaret and gerard quarrelling why it takes two to quarrel and we are but one with this gerard smiled on her sweetly but there was no kind responsive glance she looked cold gloomy and troubled he sighed and sat patiently down opposite her with his face all puzzled and saddened he said nothing for he felt sure she would explain her capricious conduct or it would explain itself presently she rose hastily and tried to reach her bedroom but on the way she staggered and put out her hand he ran to her with a cry of alarm she swooned in his arms he laid her gently on the ground and beat her cold hands and ran to her bedroom and fetched water and sprinkled her pale face his own was scarce less pale for in a basin he had seen water stained with blood it alarmed him he knew not why she was a long time ere she revived and when she did she found gerard holding her hand and bending over her with a look of infinite concern and tenderness she seemed at first as if she responded to it but the next moment her eyes dilated and she criedah wretch leave my hand how dare you touch me heaven help her said gerard she is not herself you will not leave me then gerard said she faintly alas why do i ask would i leave thee if thou wertat least touch me not and then i will let thee bide and see the last of poor margaret she neer spoke harsh to thee before sweetheart and she never will again alas what mean these dark words these wild and troubled looks said gerard clasping his hands my poor gerard said margaret forgive me that i spoke so to thee i am but a woman and would have spared thee a sight will make thee weep she burst into tears ah me she cried weeping that i cannot keep grief from thee there is a great sorrow before my darling and this time i shall not be able to come and dry his eyes let it come margaret so it touch not thee said gerard trembling dearest said margaret solemnly call now religion to thine aid and mine i must have died before thee one day or else outlived thee and so died of grief died thou die i will never let thee die where is thy pain what is thy trouble the plague she said calmly gerard uttered a cry of horror and started to his feet she read his thought useless said she quietly my nose hath bled none ever yet survived to whom that came along with the plague bring no fools hither to babble over the body they cannot save i am but a woman i love not to be stared at let none see me die but thee and even with this a convulsion seized her and she remained sensible but speechless a long time and now for the first time gerard began to realize the frightful truth and he ran wildly to and fro and cried to heaven for help as drowning men cry to their fellowcreatures she raised herself on her arm and set herself to quiet him she told him she had known the torture of hopes and fears and was resolved to spare him that agony i let my mind dwell too much on the danger said she and so opened my brain to it through which door when this subtle venom enters it makes short work i shall not be spotted or loathsome my poor darling god is good and spares thee that but in twelve hours i shall be a dead woman ah look not so but be a man be a priest waste not one precious minute over my body it is doomed but comfort my parting soul gerard sick and cold at heart kneeled down and prayed for help from heaven to do his duty when he rose from his knees his face was pale and old but deadly calm and patient he went softly and brought her bed into the room and laid her gently down and supported her head with pillows then he prayed by her side the prayers for the dying and she said amen to each prayer then for some hours she wandered but when the fell disease had quite made sure of its prey her mind cleared and she begged gerard to shrive her for oh my conscience it is laden she said sadly confess thy sins to me my daughter let there be no reserve my father said she sadly i have one great sin on my breast this many years een now that death is at my heart i can scarce own it but the lord is debonair if thou wilt pray to him perchance he may forgive me confess it first my daughter ialas confess it i deceived thee this many years i have deceived thee here tears interrupted her speech courage my daughter courage said gerard kindly overpowering the lover in the priest she hid her face in her hands and with many sighs told him it was she who had broken down the hermits cave with the help of jorian ketel i shallow did it but to hinder thy return thither but when thou sawest therein the finger of god i played the traitress and said while he thinks so he will neer leave gouda manse and i held my tongue oh false heart courage my daughter thou dost exaggerate a trivial fault ah but tis not all the birds well they followed thee not to gouda by miracle but by my treason i said he will neer be quite happy without his birds that visited him in his cell and i was jealous of them and cried and said these foul little things they are my childs rivals and i bought loaves of bread and jorian and me we put crumbs at the cave door and thence went sprinkling them all the way to the manse and there a heap and my wiles succeeded and they came and thou wast glad and i was pleased to see thee glad and when thou sawest in my guile the finger of heaven wicked deceitful i did hold my tongue but die deceiving thee ah no i could not forgive me if thou canst i was but a woman i knew no better at the time twas writ in my bosom with a very sunbeam tis good for him to bide at gouda manse forgive thee sweet innocent sobbed gerard what have i to forgive thou hadst a foolish froward child to guide to his own weal and didst all this for the best i thank thee and bless thee but as thy confessor all deceit is ill in heavens pure eyes therefore thou hast done well to confess and report it and even on thy confession and penitence the church through me absolves thee pass to thy graver faults my graver faults alas alas why what have i done to compare i am not an ill woman not a very ill one if he can forgive me deceiving thee he can well forgive me all the rest ever i did being gently pressed she said she was to blame not to have done more good in the world i have just begun to do a little she said and now i must go but i repine not since tis heavens will only i am so afeard thou wilt miss me and at this she could not restrain her tears though she tried hard gerard struggled with his as well as he could and knowing her life of piety purity and charity and seeing that she could not in her present state realise any sin but her having deceived him gave her full absolution then he put the crucifix in her hand and while he consecrated the oil bade her fix her mind neither on her merits nor her demerits but on him who died for her on the tree she obeyed him with a look of confiding love and submission and he touched her eyes with the consecrated oil and prayed aloud beside her soon after she dosed he watched beside her more dead than alive himself when the day broke she awoke and seemed to acquire some energy she begged him to look in her box for her marriage lines and for a picture and bring them both to her he did so she then entreated him by all they had suffered for each other to ease her mind by making a solemn vow to execute her dying requests he vowed to obey them to the letter then gerard let no creature come here to lay me out i could not bear to be stared at my very corpse would blush also i would not be made a monster of for the worms to sneer at as well as feed on also my very clothes are tainted and shall to earth with me i am a physicians daughter and ill becomes me kill folk being dead which did so little good to men in the days of health wherefore lap me in lead the way i am and bury me deep yet not so deep but what one day thou mayst find the way and lay thy bones by mine whiles i lived i went to gouda but once or twice a week it cost me not to go each day let me gain this by dying to be always at dear gouda in the green kirkyard also they do say the spirit hovers where the body lies i would have my spirit hover near thee and the kirkyard is not far from the manse i am so afeard some ill will happen thee margaret being gone and see with mine own hands i place my marriage lines in my bosom let no living hand move them on pain of thy curse and mine then when the angel comes for me at the last day he shall say this is an honest woman she hath her marriage lines for you know i am your lawful wife though holy church hath come between us and he will set me where the honest women be i will not sit among ill women no not in heaven for their mind is not my mind nor their soul my soul i have stood unbeknown at my window and heard their talk for some time she was unable to say any more but made signs to him that she had not done at last she recovered her breath and bade him look at the picture it was the portrait he had made of her when they were young together and little thought to part so soon he held it in his hands and looked at it but could scarce see it he had left it in fragments but now it was whole they cut it to pieces gerard but see love mocked at their knives i implore thee with my dying breath let this picture hang ever in thine eye i have heard that such as die of the plague unspotted yet after death spots have been known to come out and oh i could not bear thy last memory of me to be so therefore as soon as the breath is out of my body cover my face with this handkerchief and look at me no more till we meet again twill not be so very long o promise i promise said gerard sobbing but look on this picture instead forgive me i am but a woman i could not bear my face to lie a foul thing in thy memory nay i must have thee still think me as fair as i was true hast called me an angel once or twice but be just did i not still tell thee i was no angel but only a poor simple woman that whiles saw clearer than thou because she looked but a little way and that loves thee dearly and never loved but thee and now with her dying breath prays thee indulge her in this thou that art a man i will i will each word each wish is sacred bless thee bless thee so then the eyes that now can scarce see thee they are so troubled by the pest and the lips that shall not touch thee to taint thee will still be before thee as they were when we were young and thou didst love me when i did love thee margaret oh never loved i thee as now hast not told me so of late alas hath love no voice but words i was a priest i had charge of thy soul the sweet offices of a pure love were lawful words of love imprudent at the least but now the good fight is won ah me oh my love if thou hast lived doubting of thy gerards heart die not so for never was woman loved so tenderly as thou this ten years past calm thyself dear one said the dying woman with a heavenly smile i know it only being but a woman i could not die happy till i had heard thee say so ah i have pined ten years for those sweet words hast said them and this is the happiest hour of my life i had to die to get them well i grudge not the price from this moment a gentle complacency rested on her fading features but she did not speak then gerard who had loved her soul so many years feared lest she should expire with a mind too fixed on earthly affection oh my daughter he cried my dear daughter if indeed thou lovest me as i love thee give me not the pain of seeing thee die with thy pious soul fixed on mortal things dearest lamb of all my fold for whose soul i must answer oh think not now of mortal love but of his who died for thee on the tree oh let thy last look be heavenwards thy last word a word of prayer she turned a look of gratitude and obedience on him what saint she murmured meaning doubtless what saint should she invoke as an intercessor he to whom the saints themselves do pray she turned on him one more sweet look of love and submission and put her pretty hands together in a prayer like a child jesu this blessed word was her last she lay with her eyes heavenwards and her hands put together gerard prayed fervently for her passing spirit and when he had prayed a long time with his head averted not to see her last breath all seemed unnaturally still he turned his head fearfully it was so she was gone nothing left him now but the earthly shell of as constant pure and loving a spirit as eve adorned the earth let me not be understood to apply this to the bare outline of the relation many bishops and priests and not a few popes had wives and children as laymen and entering orders were parted from the wives and not from the children but in the case before the reader are the additional features of a strong surviving attachment on both sides and of neighbourhood besides that here the man had been led into holy orders by a false statement of the womans death on a summary of all the essential features the situation was to the best of my belief unique chapter xcvii a priest is never more thoroughly a priest than in the chamber of death gerard did the last offices of the church for the departed just as he should have done them for his smallest parishioner he did this mechanically then sat down stupefied by the sudden and tremendous blow and not yet realizing the pangs of bereavement then in a transport of religious enthusiasm he kneeled and thanked heaven for her christian end and then all his thought was to take her away from strangers and lay her in his own churchyard that very evening a covered cart with one horse started for gouda and in it was a coffin and a brokenhearted man lying with his arms and chin resting on it the mourners shortlived energy had exhausted itself in the necessary preparations and now he lay crushed clinging to the cold lead that held her the man of whom the cart was hired walked by the horses head and did not speak to him and when he baited the horse spoke but in a whisper respecting that mute agony but when he stopped for the night he and the landlord made a wellmeaning attempt to get the mourner away to take some rest and food but gerard repulsed them and when they persisted almost snarled at them like a faithful dog and clung to the cold lead all night so then they drew a cloak over him and left him in peace and at noon the sorrowful cart came up to the manse and there were full a score of parishioners collected with one little paltry trouble or another they had missed the parson already and when they saw what it was and saw their healer so stricken down they raised a loud wail of grief and it roused him from his lethargy of woe and he saw where he was and their faces and tried to speak to them oh my children my children he cried but choked with anguish could say no more yet the next day spite of all remonstrances he buried her himself and read the service with a voice that only trembled now and then many tears fell upon her grave and when the service ended he stayed there standing like a statue and the people left the churchyard out of respect he stood like one in a dream till the sexton who was as most men are a fool began to fill in the grave without giving him due warning but at the sound of earth falling on her gerard uttered a piercing scream the sexton forbore gerard staggered and put his hand to his breast the sexton supported him and called for help jorian ketel who lingered near mourning his benefactress ran into the churchyard and the two supported gerard into the manse ah jorian good jorian said he something snapped within me i felt it and i heard it here jorian here and he put his hand to his breast chapter xcviii a fortnight after this a pale bowed figure entered the dominican convent in the suburbs of gouda and sought speech with brother ambrose who governed the convent as deputy the prior having lately died and his successor though appointed not having arrived the sick man was gerard come to end life as he began it he entered as a novice on probation but the truth was he was a failing man and knew it and came there to die in peace near kind and gentle ambrose his friend and the other monks to whom his house and heart had always been open his manse was more than he could bear it was too full of reminiscences of her ambrose who knew his value and his sorrow was not without a kindly hope of curing him and restoring him to his parish with this view he put him in a comfortable cell over the gateway and forbade him to fast or practice any austerities but in a few days the new prior arrived and proved a very tartar at first he was absorbed in curing abuses and tightening the general discipline but one day hearing the vicar of gouda had entered the convent as a novice he said tis well let him first give up his vicarage then or go ill no fat parsons in my house the prior then sent for gerard and he went to him and the moment they saw one another they both started clement jerome chapter xcix jerome was as morose as ever in his general character but he had somewhat softened towards gerard all the time he was in england he had missed him more then he thought possible and since then had often wondered what had become of him what he heard in gouda raised his feeble brother in his good opinion above all that he had withstood the pope and the minorites on the infernal heresy of the immaculate conception as he called it but when one of his young monks told him with tears in his eyes the cause of gerards illness all his contempt revived dying for a woman he determined to avert this scandal he visited clement twice a day in his cell and tried all his old influence and all his eloquence to induce him to shake off this unspiritual despondency and not rob the church of his piety and his eloquence at so critical a period gerard heard him approved his reasoning admired his strength confessed his own weakness and continued visibly to wear away to the land of the leal one day jerome told him he had heard his story and heard it with pride but now said he you spoil it all clement for this is the triumph of earthly passion better have yielded to it and repented than resist it while she lived and succumb under it now body and soul dear jerome said clement so sweetly as to rob his remonstrance of the tone of remonstrance here i think you do me some injustice passion there is none but a deep affection for which i will not blush here since i shall not blush for it in heaven bethink thee jerome the poor dog that dies of grief on his masters grave is he guilty of passion neither am i passion had saved my life and lost my soul she was my good angel she sustained me in my duty and charity her face encouraged me in the pulpit her lips soothed me under ingratitude she intertwined herself with all that was good in my life and after leaning on her so long i could not go on alone and dear jerome believe me i am no rebel against heaven it is gods will to release me when they threw the earth upon her poor coffin something snapped within my bosom here that mended may not be i heard it and i felt it and from that time jerome no food that i put in my mouth had any savour with my eyes bandaged now i could not tell thee which was bread and which was flesh by eating of it holy saints and again from that same hour my deep dejection left me and i smiled again i often smilewhy i read it thus he in whose hands are the issues of life and death gave me that minute the great summons twas some cord of life snapped in me he is very pitiful i should have lived unhappy but he said no enough is done enough is suffered poor feeble loving servant thy shortcomings are forgiven thy sorrows touch thine end come thou to thy rest i come lord i come jerome groaned the church had ever her holy but feeble servants he said now would i give ten years of my life to save thine but i see it may not be die in peace and so it was that in a few days more gerard lay adying in a frame of mind so holy and happy that more than one aged saint was there to garner his dying words in the evening he had seen giles and begged him not to let poor jack starve and to see that little gerards trustees did their duty and to kiss his parents for him and to send denys to his friends in burgundy poor thing he will feel so strange here without his comrade and after that he had an interview with jerome alone what passed between them was never distinctly known but it must have been something remarkable for jerome went from the door with his hands crossed on his breast his high head lowered and sighing as he went the two monks that watched with him till matins related that all through the night he broke out from time to time in pious ejaculations and praises and thanksgivings only once they said he wandered and thought he saw her walking in green meadows with other spirits clad in white and beckoning him and they all smiled and beckoned him and both these monks said but it might have been fancy that just before dawn there came three light taps against the wall one after another very slow and the dying man heard them and said i come love i come this much is certain that gerard did utter these words and prepare for his departure having uttered them he sent for all the monks who at that hour were keeping vigil they came and hovered like gentle spirits round him with holy words some prayed in silence for him with their faces touching the ground others tenderly supported his head but when one of them said something about his life of selfdenial and charity he stopped him and addressing them all said my dear brethren take note that he who here dies so happy holds not these newfangled doctrines of mans merit oh what a miserable hour were this to me an if i did nay but i hold with the apostles and their pupils in the church the ancient fathers that we are justified not by our own wisdom or piety or the works we have done in holiness of heart but by faith then there was silence and the monks looked at one another significantly please you sweep the floor said the dying christian in a voice to which all its clearance and force seemed supernaturally restored they instantly obeyed not without a sentiment of awe and curiosity make me a great cross with wood ashes they strewed the ashes in form of a great cross upon the floor now lay me down on it for so will i die and they took him gently from his bed and laid him on the cross of wood ashes shall we spread out thine arms dear brother now god forbid am i worthy of that he lay silent but with his eyes raised in ecstasy presently he spoke half to them half to himself oh he said with a subdued but concentrated rapture i feel it buoyant it lifts me floating in the sky whence my merits had sunk me like lead day broke and displayed his face cast upward in silent rapture and his hands together like margarets and just about the hour she died he spoke his last word in this world jesu and even with that wordhe fell asleep they laid him out for his last restingplace under his linen they found a horsehair shirt ah cried the young monks behold a saint under the hair cloth they found a long thick tress of auburn hair they started and were horrified and a babel of voices arose some condemning some excusing in the midst of which jerome came in and hearing the dispute turned to an ardent young monk called basil who was crying scandal the loudest basil said he is she alive or dead that owned this hair how may i know father then for aught you know it may be the relic of a saint certes it may be said basil sceptically you have then broken our rule which saith put ill construction on no act done by a brother which can be construed innocently who are you to judge such a man as this was go to your cell and stir not out for a week by way of penance he then carried off the lock of hair and when the coffin was to be closed he cleared the cell and put the tress upon the dead mans bosom there clement said he to the dead face and set himself a penance for doing it and nailed the coffin up himself the next day gerard was buried in gouda churchyard the monks followed him in procession from the convent jerome who was evidently carrying out the wishes of the deceased read the service the grave was a deep one and at the bottom of it was a lead coffin poor gerards light as a feather so wasted was he was lowered and placed by the side of it after the service jerome said a few words to the crowd of parishioners that had come to take the last look at their best friend when he spoke of the virtues of the departed loud wailing and weeping burst forth and tears fell upon the coffin like rain the monks went home jerome collected them in the refectory and spoke to them thus we have this day laid a saint in the earth the convent will keep his trentals but will feast not fast for our good brother is freed from the burden of the flesh his labours are over and he has entered into his joyful rest i alone shall fast and do penance for to my shame i say it i was unjust to him and knew not his worth till it was too late and you young monks be not curious to inquire whether a lock he bore on his bosom was a token of pure affection or the relic of a saint but remember the heart he wore beneath most of all fix your eyes upon his life and conversation and follow them an ye may for he was a holy man thus after lifes fitful fever these true lovers were at peace the grave kinder to them than the church united them for ever and now a man of another age and nation touched with their fate has laboured to build their tombstone and rescue them from long and unmerited oblivion he asks for them your sympathy but not your pity no put this story to a wholesome use fiction must often give false views of life and death here as it happens curbed by history she gives you true ones let the barrier that kept these true lovers apart prepare you for this that here on earth there will nearly always be some obstacle or other to your perfect happiness to their early death apply your reason and your faith by way of exercise and preparation for if you cannot bear to be told that these died young who had they lived a hundred years would still be dead how shall you bear to see the gentle the loving and the true glide from your own bosom to the grave and fly from your house to heaven yet this is in store for you in every age the master of life and death who is kinder as well as wiser than we are has transplanted to heaven young earths sweetest flowers i ask your sympathy then for their rare constancy and pure affection and their cruel separation by a vile heresy in the bosom of the church but not your pity for their early but happy

smaller fragments of humanity i have scattered about ie some of them for the wayside characters have no claim on me they have served their turn if they have persuaded the reader that gerard travelled from holland to rome through human beings and not through a population of dolls eli and catherine lived to a great age lived so long that both gerard and margaret grew to be dim memories giles also was longaevous he went to the court of bavaria and was alive there at ninety but had somehow turned into bones and leather trumpet toned cornelis free from all rivals and forgiven long ago by his mother who clung to him more and more now all her brood was scattered waited and waited and waited for his parents decease but catherines shrewd word came true ere she and her mate wore out this

unexpectedly he inherited a considerable sum from a relation he was known in his native place for many years as a crusty old soldier who could tell good stories of war when he chose and a bitter

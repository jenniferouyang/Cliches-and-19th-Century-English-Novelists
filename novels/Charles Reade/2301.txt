a simpleton by charles reade preface it has lately been objected to me in studiously courteous terms of course that i borrow from other books and am a plagiarist to this i reply that i borrow facts from every accessible source and am not a plagiarist the plagiarist is one who borrows from a homogeneous work for such a man borrows not ideas only but their treatment he who borrows only from heterogeneous works is not a plagiarist all fiction worth a button is founded on facts and it does not matter one straw whether the facts are taken from personal experience hearsay or printed books only those books must not be works of fiction ask your common sense why a man writes better fiction at forty than he can at twenty it is simply because he has gathered more facts from each of these three sourcesexperience hearsay print to those who have science enough to appreciate the above distinction i am very willing to admit that in all my tales i use a vast deal of heterogeneous material which in a life of study i have gathered from men journals bluebooks histories biographies law reports etc and if i could i would gladly specify all the various printed sources to which i am indebted but my memory is not equal to such a feat i can only say that i rarely write a novel without milking about two hundred heterogeneous cows into my pail and that a simpleton is no exception to my general method that method is the true method and the best and if on that method i do not write prime novels it is the fault of the man and not of the method i give the following particulars as an illustration of my method in a simpleton the whole business of the girl spitting blood the surgeon ascribing it to the liver the consultation the final solution of the mystery is a matter of personal experience accurately recorded but the rest of the medical truths both fact and argument are all from medical books far too numerous to specify this includes the strange fluctuations of memory in a man recovering his reason by degrees the behavior of the doctors first two patients i had from a surgeons daughter in pimlico the servantgirl and her box the purplefaced pigfaced beak and his justice are personal experience the business of houserenting and the auctionroom is also personal experience in the nautical business i had the assistance of two practical seamen my brother william barrington reade and commander charles edward reade rn in the south african business i gleaned from mr days recent handbooks the old handbooks galtons vacation tourist philip mavor or life among the caffres fossor notes on the cape of good hope scenes and occurrences in albany and caffreland bowlers south african sketches a campaign in south africa lucas five years in caffreland mrs ward etc etc etc but my principal obligation on this head is to mr boyle the author of some admirable letters to the daily telegraph which he afterwards reprinted in a delightful volume mr boyle has a painters eye and a writers pen and if the african scenes in a simpleton please my readers i hope they will go to the fountainhead where they will find many more as to the plot and characters they are invented the title a simpleton is not quite new there is a french play called la niaise but la niaise is in reality a woman of rare intelligence who is taken for a simpleton by a lot of conceited fools and the play runs on their blunders and her unpretending wisdom that is a very fine plot which i recommend to our female novelists my aim in these pages has been much humbler and is i hope too clear to need explanation charles reade a simpleton chapter i a young lady sat pricking a framed canvas in the drawingroom of kent villa a mile from gravesend she was making at a cost of time and tinted wool a chair cover admirably unfit to be sat uponexcept by some severe artist bent on obliterating discordant colors to do her justice her mind was not in her work for she rustled softly with restlessness as she sat and she rose three times in twenty minutes and went to the window thence she looked down over a trim flowery lawn and long sloping meadows on to the silver thames alive with steamboats ploughing white sails bellying and great ships carrying to and fro the treasures of the globe from this fair landscape and epitome of commerce she retired each time with listless disdain she was waiting for somebody yet she was one of those whom few men care to keep waiting rosa lusignan was a dark but dazzling beauty with coalblack hair and glorious dark eyes that seemed to beam with soul all day long her eyebrows black straightish and rather thick would have been majestic and too severe had the other features followed suit but her black brows were succeeded by long silky lashes a sweet oval face two pouting lips studded with ivory and an exquisite chin as feeble as any man could desire in the partner of his bosom personstraight elastic and rather tall mindnineteen accomplishmentsnumerous a poor french scholar a worse german a worse english an admirable dancer an inaccurate musician a good rider a bad draughtswoman a bad hairdresser at the mercy of her maid a hot theologian knowing nothing a sorry accountant no housekeeper no seamstress a fair embroideress a capital geographer and no cook collectively viz mind and body the girl we kneel to this ornamental member of society now glanced at the clock once more and then glided to the window for the fourth time she peeped at the side a good while with superfluous slyness or shyness and presently she drew back blushing crimson then she peeped again still more furtively then retired softly to her frame and for the first time set to work in earnest as she plied her harpoon smiling now the large and vivid blush that had suffused her face and throat turned from carnation to rose and melted away slowly but perceptibly and ever so sweetly and somebody knocked at the street door the blow seemed to drive her deeper into her work she leaned over it graceful as a willow and so absorbed she could not even see the door of the room open and dr staines come in all the better her not perceiving that slight addition to her furniture gives me a moment to describe him a young man five feet eleven inches high very square shouldered and deep chested but so symmetrical and light in his movements that his size hardly struck one at first he was smooth shaved all but a short thick auburn whisker his hair was brown his features no more then comely the brow full the eyes wide apart and deepseated the lips rather thin but expressive the chin solid and square it was a face of power and capable of harshness but relieved by an eye of unusual color between hazel and gray and wonderfully tender in complexion he could not compare with rosa his cheek was clear but pale for few young men had studied night and day so constantly though but twentyeight years of age he was literally a learned physician deep in hospital practice deep in books especially deep in german science too often neglected or skimmed by english physicians he had delivered a course of lectures at a learned university with general applause as my reader has divined rosa was preparing the comedy of a cool reception but looking up she saw his pale cheek tinted with a lovers beautiful joy at the bare sight of her and his soft eye so divine with love that she had not the heart to chill him she gave him her hand kindly and smiled brightly on him instead of remonstrating she lost nothing by it for the very first thing he did was to excuse himself eagerly i am behind time the fact is just as i was mounting my horse a poor man came to the gate to consult me he had a terrible disorder i have sometimes succeeded in arrestingi attack the cause instead of the symptoms which is the old practiceand so that detained me you forgive me of course poor manonly you said you wanted to see papa and he always goes out at two when she had been betrayed into saying this she drew in suddenly and blushed with a pretty consciousness then dont let me lose another minute said the lover have you prepared him forforwhat i am going to have the audacity to say rosa answered with some hesitation i must havea little when i refused colonel brightyou need not devour my hand quitehe is forty her sentence ended and away went the original topic and grammatical sequence along with it christopher staines recaptured them both yes dear when you refused colonel bright well papa was astonished for everybody says the colonel is a most eligible match dont you hate that expression i do eligible christopher made due haste and recaptured her yes love your papa said i dont think i will tell you he asked me was there anybody else and of course i said no oh oh that is nothing i had not time to make up my mind to tell the truth i was taken by surprise and you know ones first impulse is to fibabout that but did you really deceive him no i blushed and he caught me so he said come now there was and you said yes there is like a brave girl as you are what plump like that no i was frightened out of my wits like a brave girl as i am not and said i should never marry any one he could disapprove and thenoh then i believe i began to cry christopher ill tell you something i find people leave off teasing you when you crygentlemen i mean ladies go on all the more so then dear papa kissed me and told me i must not be imprudent and throw myself away that was all and i promised him i never would i said he would be sure to approve my choice and he said he hoped so and so he will dr staines looked thoughtful and said he hoped so too but now it comes to the point of asking him for such a treasure i feel my deficiencies why what deficiencies you are young and handsome and good and ever so much cleverer than other people you have only to ask for me and insist on having me come dear go and get it over she added mighty coolly there is nothing so dreadful as suspense ill go this minute said he and took a step towards the door but he turned and in a moment was at her knees he took both her hands in his and pressed them to his beating bosom while his beautiful eyes poured love into hers pointblank may i tell him you love me oh i know you cannot love me as i love you but i may say you love me a little may i notthat will go farther with him than anything else may i rosa may ia little his passion mastered her she dropped her head sweetly on his shoulder and murmured you know you may my own who would not love you he parted lingeringly from her then marched away bold with love and hope to demand her hand in marriage rosa leaned back in her chair and quivered a little with new emotions christopher was right she was not capable of loving like him but still the actual contact of so strong a passion made her womans nature vibrate a dewy tear hung on the fringes of her long lashes and she leaned back in her chair and fluttered awhile that emotion almost new to her soon yielded in her girlish mind to a complacent languor and that in its turn to a soft reverie so she was going to be married to be mistress of a house settle in london that she had quite determined long ago be able to go out into the streets all alone to shop or visit have a gentleman all her own whom she could put her finger on any moment and make him take her about even to the opera and the theatre to give dinnerparties her own self and even a little ball once in a way to buy whatever dresses she thought proper instead of being crippled by an allowance have the legal right of speaking first in society even to gentlemen rich in ideas but bad starters instead of sitting mumchance and mockmodest to be mistress instead of misscontemptible title to be a woman instead of a girl and all this rational liberty domestic power and social dignity were to be obtained by merely wedding a dear fellow who loved her and was so nice and the bright career to be ushered in with several delights each of them dear to a girls very soul presents from all her friends as many beautiful new dresses as if she was changing her body or her hemisphere instead of her name eclat going to church which is a good english girls theatre of display and temple of vanity and there tasting delightful publicity and whispered admiration in a heavenly long veil which she could not wear even once if she remained single this bright variegated picture of holy wedlock and its essential features as revealed to young ladies by feminine tradition though not enumerated in the book of common prayer writ by grim males so entranced her that time flew by unheeded and christopher staines came back from her father his step was heavy he looked pale and deeply distressed then stood like a statue and did not come close to her but cast a piteous look and gasped out one word that seemed almost to choke himrefused miss lusignan rose from her chair and looked almost wildly at him with her great eyes refused said she faintly yes said he sadly your father is a man of business and he took a mere business view of our love he asked me directly what provision i could make for his daughter and her children well i told him i had three thousand pounds in the funds and a good profession and then i said i had youth health and love boundless love the love that can do or suffer the love that can conquer the world dear christopher and what could he say to all that he ignored it entirely there ill give you his very words he said in that case dr staines the simple question is what does your profession bring you in per annum oh there i always hated arithmetic and now i abominate it then i was obliged to confess i had scarcely received a hundred pounds in fees this year but i told him the reason this is such a small district and all the ground occupied london i said was my sphere and so it is said rosa eagerly for this jumped with her own little designs genius is wasted in the country besides whenever anybody worth curing is ill down here they always send to london for a doctor i told him so dearest said the lover but he answered me directly then i must set up in london and as soon as my books showed an income to keep a wife and servants and children and insure my life for five thousand pounds oh that is so like papa he is director of an insurance company so all the world must insure their lives no dear he was quite right there professional incomes are most precarious death spares neither young nor old neither warm hearts nor cold i should be no true physician if i could not see my own mortality he hung his head and pondered a moment then went on sadly it all comes to thisuntil i have a professional income of eight hundred a year at least he will not hear of our marrying and the cruel thing is he will not even consent to an engagement but said the rejected with a look of sad anxiety you will wait for me without that dear rosa she could give him that comfort and she gave it him with loving earnestness of course i will and it shall not be very long whilst you are making your fortune to please papa i will keep fretting and pouting and crying till he sends for you bless you dearest stopnot to make yourself ill not for all the world the lover and the physician spoke in turn he came all gratitude to her side and they sat hand in hand comforting each other indeed parting was such sweet sorrow that they sat handed and very close to one another till mr lusignan who thought five minutes quite enough for rational beings to take leave in walked into the room and surprised them at sight of his gray head and irongray eyebrows christopher staines started up and looked confused he thought some apology necessary so he faltered out forgive me sir it is a bitter parting to me you may be sure rosas bosom heaved at these simple words she flew to her father and cried oh papa papa you were never cruel before and hid her burning face on his shoulder and then burst out crying partly for christopher partly because she was now ashamed of herself for having taken a young mans part so openly mr lusignan looked sadly discomposed at this outburst she had taken him by his weak point he told her so now rosa said he rather peevishly you know i hatenoise rosa had actually forgotten that trait for a single moment but being reminded of it she reduced her sobs in the prettiest way not to offend a tender parent who could not bear noise under this homely term you must know he included all scenes disturbances rumpuses passions and expected all men women and things in kent villa to go smoothlyor go elsewhere come young people said he dont make a disturbance wheres the grievance have i said he shall never marry you have i forbidden him to correspond or even to call say twice a year all i say is no marriage nor contract of marriage until there is an income then he turned to christopher now if you cant make an income without her how could you make one with her weighed down by the load of expenses a wife entails i know her better than you do she is a good girl but rather luxurious and selfindulgent she is not cut out for a poor mans wife and pray dont go and fancy that nobody loves my child but you mine is not so hot as yours of course but believe me sir it is less selfish you would expose her to poverty and misery but i say no it is my duty to protect her from all chance of them and in doing it i am as much your friend as hers if you could but see it come dr staines be a man and see the world as it is i have told you how to earn my daughters hand and my esteem you must gain both or neither dr staines was never quite deaf to reason he now put his hand to his brow and said with a sort of wonder and pitiful dismay my love for rosa selfish sir your words are bitter and hard then after a struggle and with rare and touching candor ay but so are bark and steel yet they are good medicines then with a great glow in his heart and tears in his eyes my darling shall not be a poor mans wife she who would adorn a coronet ay or a crown goodby rosa for the present he darted to her and kissed her hand with all his soul oh the sacrifice of leaving you he faltered the very world is dark to me without you ah well i must earn the right to come again he summoned all his manhood and marched to the door there he seemed to turn calmer all of a sudden and said firmly yet humbly ill try and show you sir what love can do and ill show you what love can suffer said rosa folding her beautiful arms superbly it was not in her to have shot such a bolt except in imitation yet how promptly the mimic thunder came and how grand the beauty looked with her dark brows and flashing eyes and folded arms much grander and more inspired than poor staines who had only furnished the idea but between these two figures swelling with emotion the representative of common sense lusignan pere stood cool and impassive he shrugged his shoulders and looked on both lovers as a couple of ranting novices he was saving from each other and almshouses for all that when the lover had torn himself away papas composure was suddenly disturbed by a misgiving he stepped hastily to the stairhead and gave it vent dr staines said he in a loud whisper staines was half way down the stairs he stopped i trust to you as a gentleman not to mention this it will never transpire here whatever we dono noise chapter ii rosa lusignan set herself pining as she had promised and she did it discreetly for so young a person she was never peevish but always sad and listless by this means she did not anger her parent but only made him feel she was unhappy and the house she had hitherto brightened exceeding dismal by degrees this noiseless melancholy undermined the old gentleman and he wellnigh tottered but one day calling suddenly on a neighbor with six daughters he heard peals of laughter and found rosa taking her full share of the senseless mirth she pulled up short at sight of him and colored high but it was too late for he launched a knowing look at her on the spot and muttered something about seven foolish virgins he took the first opportunity when they were alone and told her he was glad to find she was only dismal at home but rosa had prepared for him one can be loud without being gay at heart said she with a lofty languid air i have not forgotten your last words to him we were to hide our broken hearts from the world i try to obey you dear papa but if i had my way i would never go into the world at all i have but one desire nowto end my days in a convent please begin them first a convent why youd turn it out of window you are no more fit to be a nun thana pauper not having foreseen this facer rosa had nothing ready so she received it with a sad submissive helpless sigh as who would say hit me papa i have no friend now so then he was sorry he had been so clever and indeed there is one provoking thing about a womans weaknessit is invincible the next minute what should come but a long letter from dr staines detailing his endeavors to purchase a practice in london and his illsuccess the letter spoke the language of love and hope but the facts were discouraging and indeed a touching sadness pierced through the veil of the brave words rosa read it again and again and cried over it before her father to encourage him in his heartless behavior about ten days after this something occurred that altered her mood she became grave and thoughtful but no longer lugubrious she seemed desirous to atone to her father for having disturbed his cheerfulness she smiled affectionately on him and often sat on a stool at his knee and glided her hand into his he was not a little pleased and said to himself she is coming round to commonsense now on the contrary she was farther from it than ever at last he got the clew one afternoon he met mr wyman coming out of the villa mr wyman was the consulting surgeon of that part what anybody ill said mr lusignan one of the servants no it is miss lusignan why what is the matter with her wyman hesitated oh nothing very alarming would you mind asking her why the fact is she requested me not to tell you made me promise and i insist upon your telling me and i think you are quite right sir as her father well she is troubled with a little spitting of blood mr lusignan turned pale my child spitting of blood god forbid oh do not alarm yourself it is nothing serious dont tell me said the father it is always serious and she kept this from me masking his agitation for the time he inquired how often it had occurred this grave symptom three or four times this last month but i may as well tell you at once i have examined her carefully and i do not think it is from the lungs from the throat then no from the liver everything points to that organ as the seat of derangement not that there is any lesion only a tendency to congestion i am treating her accordingly and have no doubt of the result who is the ablest physician hereabouts asked lusignan abruptly dr snell i think give me his address ill write to him if you like and appoint a consultation he added with vast but rather sudden alacrity it will be a great satisfaction to my own mind then send to him if you please and let him be here tomorrow morning if not i shall take her to london for advice at once on this understanding they parted and lusignan went at once to his daughter o my child said he deeply distressed how could you hide this from me hide what papa said the girl looking the picture of unconsciousness that you have been spitting blood who told you that said she sharply wyman he is attending you rosa colored with anger chatterbox he promised me faithfully not to but why in heavens name what would you trust this terrible thing to a stranger and hide it from your poor father yes replied rosa quietly the old man would not scold her now he only said sadly i see how it is because i will not let you marry poverty you think i do not love you and he sighed o papa the idea said rosa of course i know you love me it was not that you dear darling foolish papa there if you must know it was because i did not want you to be distressed i thought i might get better with a little physic and if not why then i thought papa is an old man la i dare say i shall last his time and so why should i poison your latter days with worrying about me mr lusignan stared at her and his lip quivered but he thought the trait hardly consistent with her superficial character he could not help saying half sadly half bitterly well but of course you have told dr staines rosa opened her beautiful eyes like two suns of course i have done nothing of the sort he has enough to trouble him without that poor fellow there he is worrying and striving to make his fortune and gain your esteemthey go together you know you told him so young cats will scratch when least expected and for me to go and tell him i am in danger why he would go wild he would think of nothing but me and my health he would never make his fortune and so then even when i am gone he will never get a wife because he has only got genius and goodness and three thousand pounds no papa i have not told poor christopher i may tease those i love i have been teasing you this ever so long but frighten them and make them miserable no and here thinking of the anguish that was perhaps in store for those she loved she wanted to cry it almost choked her not to but she fought it bravely down she reserved her tears for lighter occasions and less noble sentiments her father held out his arms to her she ran her footstool to him and sat nestling to his heart please forgive me my misconduct i have not been a dutiful daughter ever since youbut now i will kiss me my own papa there now we are as we always were then she purred to him on every possible topic but the one that now filled his parental heart and bade him goodnight at last with a cheerful smile wyman was exact and ten minutes afterwards dr snell drove up in a carriage and pair he was intercepted in the hall by wyman and after a few minutes conversation presented to mr lusignan the father gave vent to his paternal anxiety in a few simple but touching words and was proceeding to state the symptoms as he had gathered them from his daughter but dr snell interrupted him politely and said he had heard the principal symptoms from mr wyman then turning to the latter he said we had better proceed to examine the patient certainly said mr lusignan she is in the drawingroom and he led the way and was about to enter the room when wyman informed him it was against etiquette for him to be present at the examination oh very well said he yes i see the propriety of that but oblige me by asking her if she has anything on her mind dr snell bowed a lofty assent for to receive a hint from a layman was to confer a favor on him the men of science were closeted full half an hour with the patient she was too beautiful to be slurred over even by a busy doctor he felt her pulse looked at her tongue and listened attentively to her lungs to her heart and to the organ suspected by wyman he left her at last with a kindly assurance that the case was perfectly curable at the door they were met by the anxious father who came with throbbing heart and asked the doctors verdict he was coolly informed that could not be given until the consultation had taken place the result of that consultation would be conveyed to him and pray why cant i be present at the consultation the grounds on which two able men agree or disagree must be well worth listening to no doubt said dr snell but with a superior smile my dear sir it is not the etiquette oh very well said lusignan but he muttered so then a father is nobody and this unreasonable person retired to his study miserable and gave up the diningroom to the consultation they soon rejoined him dr snells opinion was communicated by wyman i am happy to tell you that dr snell agrees with me entirely the lungs are not affected and the liver is congested but not diseased is that so dr snell asked lusignan anxiously it is so sir he added the treatment has been submitted to me and i quite approve it he then asked for a pen and paper and wrote a prescription he assured mr lusignan that the case had no extraordinary feature whatever he was not to alarm himself dr snell then drove away leaving the parent rather puzzled but on the whole much comforted and here i must reveal an extraordinary circumstance wymans treatment was by drugs dr snells was by drugs dr snell as you have seen entirely approved wymans treatment his own had nothing in common with it the arctic and antarctic poles are not farther apart than was his prescription from the prescription he thoroughly approved amiable science in which complete diversity of practice did not interfere with perfect uniformity of opinion all this was kept from dr staines and he was entirely occupied in trying to get a position that might lead to fortune and satisfy mr lusignan he called on every friend he had to inquire where there was an opening he walked miles and miles in the best quarters of london looking for an opening he let it be known in many quarters that he would give a good premium to any physician who was about to retire and would introduce him to his patients no he could hear of nothing then after a great struggle with himself he called upon his uncle philip staines a retired md to see if he would do anything for him he left this to the last for a very good reason dr philip was an irritable old bachelor who had assisted most of his married relatives but finding no bottom to the well had turned rusty and crusty and now was apt to administer kicks instead of checks to all who were near and dear to him however christopher was the old gentlemans favorite and was now desperate so he mustered courage and went he was graciously receivedwarmly indeed this gave him great hopes and he told his tale the old bachelor sided with mr lusignan what said he do you want to marry and propagate pauperism i thought you had more sense confound it all i had just one nephew whose knock at my streetdoor did not make me tremble he was a bachelor and a thinker and came for a friendly chat the rest are married men highwaymen who come to say stand and deliver and now even you want to join the giddy throng well dont ask me to have any hand in it you are a man of promise and you might as well hang a millstone round your neck as a wife marriage is a greater mistake than ever now the women dress more and manage worse i met your cousin jack the other day and his wife with seventy pounds on her back and next door to paupers no whilst you are a bachelor like me you are my favorite and down in my will for a lump once marry and you join the noble army of footpads leeches vultures paupers gone coons and babblers about bratsand i disown you there was no hope from old crusty christopher left him snubbed and heartsick at last he met a sensible man who made him see there was no short cut in that profession he must be content to play the uphill game must settle in some good neighborhood marry if possible since husbands and fathers of families prefer married physicians and so be poor at thirty comfortable at forty and rich at fiftyperhaps then christopher came down to his lodgings at gravesend and was very unhappy and after some days of misery he wrote a letter to rosa in a moment of impatience despondency and passion rosa lusignan got worse and worse the slight but frequent hemorrhage was a drain upon her system and weakened her visibly she began to lose her rich complexion and sometimes looked almost sallow and a slight circle showed itself under her eyes these symptoms were unfavorable nevertheless dr snell and mr wyman accepted them cheerfully as fresh indications that nothing was affected but the liver they multiplied and varied their prescriptions the malady ignored those prescriptions and went steadily on mr lusignan was terrified but helpless rosa resigned and reticent but it was not in human nature that a girl of this age could always and at all hours be mistress of herself one evening in particular she stood before the glass in the drawingroom and looked at herself a long time with horror is that rosa lusignan said she aloud it is her ghost a deep groan startled her she turned it was her father she thought he was fast asleep and so indeed he had been but he was just awaking and heard his daughter utter her real mind it was a thunderclap oh my child what shall i do he cried then rosa was taken by surprise in her turn she spoke out send for a great physician papa dont let us deceive ourselves it is our only chance i will ask mr wyman to get a physician down from london no no that is no use they will put their heads together and he will say whatever mr wyman tells him la papa a clever man like you not to see what a cheat that consultation was why from what you told me one can see it was managed so that dr snell could not possibly have an opinion of his own no no more echoes of mr chatterbox if you really want to cure me send for christopher staines dr staines he is very young but he is very clever and he is not an echo he wont care how many doctors he contradicts when i am in danger papa it is your childs one chance ill try it said the old man eagerly how confident you look your color has come back it is an inspiration where is he i think by this time he must be at his lodgings in gravesend send to him tomorrow morning not i ill go to him tonight it is only a mile and a fine clear night my own good kind papa ah well come what may i have lived long enough to be loved yes dear papa save me i am very young to die and he loves me so dearly the old man bustled away to put on something warmer for his night walk and rosa leaned back and the tears welled out of her eyes now he was gone before she had recovered her composure a letter was brought her and this was the letter from christopher staines alluded to already she took it from the servant with averted head not wishing it to be seen she had been crying and she started at the handwriting it seemed such a coincidence that it should come just as she was sending for him my own beloved rosai now write to tell you with a heavy heart that all is vain i cannot make nor purchase a connection except as others do by time and patience being a bachelor is quite against a young physician if i had a wife and such a wife as you i should be sure to get on you would increase my connection very soon what then lies before us i see but two thingsto wait till we are old and our pockets are filled but our hearts chilled or soured or else to marry at once and climb the hill together if you love me as i love you you will be saving till the battle is over and i feel i could find energy and fortitude for both your father who thinks so much of wealth can surely settle something on you and i am not too poor to furnish a house and start fair i am not quite obscuremy lectures have given me a nameand to you my own love i hope i may say that i know more than many of my elders thanks to good schools good method a genuine love of my noble profession and a tendency to study from my childhood will you not risk something on my ability if not god help me for i shall lose you and what is life or fame or wealth or any mortal thing to me without you i cannot accept your fathers decision you must decide my fate you see i have kept away from you until i can do so no more all this time the world to me has seemed to want the sun and my heart pines and sickens for one sight of you darling rosa pray let me look at your face once more when this reaches you i shall be at your gate let me see you though but for a moment and let me hear my fate from no lips but yoursmy own love your heartbroken lover christopher staines this letter stunned her at first her mind of late had been turned away from love to such stern realities now she began to be sorry she had not told him poor thing she said to herself he little knows that now all is changed papa i sometimes think would deny me nothing now it is i who would not marry himto be buried by him in a month or two poor christopher the next moment she started up in dismay why her father would miss him no perhaps catch him waiting for her what would he think what would christopher thinkthat she had shown her papa his letter she rang the bell hard the footman came send harriet to me this instant oh and ask papa to come to me then she sat down and dashed off a line to christopher this was for harriet to take out to him anything better than for christopher to be caught doing what was wrong the footman came back first if you please miss master has gone out run after himthe road to gravesend yes miss no it is no use never mind yes miss then harriet came in did you want me miss yes nonever mind now she was afraid to do anything for fear of making matters worse she went to the window and stood looking anxiously out with her hands working presently she uttered a little scream and shrank away to the sofa she sank down on it half sitting half lying hid her face in her hands and waited staines with a lovers impatience had been more than an hour at the gate or walking up and down close by it his heart now burning with hope now freezing with fear that she would decline a meeting on these terms at last the postman came and then he saw he was too soon but now in a few minutes rosa would have his letter and then he should soon know whether she would come or not he looked up at the drawingroom windows they were full of light she was there in all probability yet she did not come to them but why should she if she was coming out he walked up and down the road she did not come his heart began to sicken with doubt his head drooped and perhaps it was owing to this that he almost ran against a gentleman who was coming the other way the moon shone bright on both faces dr staines said mr lusignan surprised christopher uttered an ejaculation more eloquent than words they stared at each other you were coming to call on us nno stammered christopher lusignan thought that odd however he said politely no matter it is fortunate would you mind coming in no faltered christopher and stared at him ruefully puzzled more and more but beginning to think after all it might be a casual meeting they entered the gate and in one moment he saw rosa at the window and she saw him then he altered his opinion again rosa had sent her father out to him but how was this the old man did not seem angry christophers heart gave a leap inside him and he began to glow with the wildest hopes for what could this mean but relenting mr lusignan took him first into the study and lighted two candles himself he did not want the servants prying the lights showed christopher a change in mr lusignan he looked ten years older you are not well sir said christopher gently my health is well enough but i am a brokenhearted man dr staines forget all that passed here at your last visit all that is over thank you for loving my poor girl as you do give me your hand god bless you sir i am sorry to say it is as a physician i invite you now she is ill sir very very ill ill and not tell me she kept it from you my poor friend not to distress you and she tried to keep it from me but how could she for two months she has had some terrible complaintit is destroying her she is the ghost of herself oh my poor child my child the old man sobbed aloud the young man stood trembling and ashy pale still the habits of his profession and the experience of dangers overcome together with a certain sense of power kept him up but above all love and duty said be firm he asked for an outline of the symptoms they alarmed him greatly let us lose no more time said he i will see her at once do you object to my being present of course not shall i tell you what dr snell says it is and mr wyman by all meansafter i have seen her this comforted mr lusignan he was to get an independent judgment at all events when they reached the top of the stairs dr staines paused and leaned against the baluster give me a moment said he the patient must not know how my heart is beating and she must see nothing in my face but what i choose her to see give me your hand once more sir let us both control ourselves now announce me mr lusignan opened the door and said with forced cheerfulness dr staines my dear come to give you the benefit of his skill she lay on the sofa just as we left her only her bosom began to heave then christopher staines drew himself up and the majesty of knowledge and love together seemed to dilate his noble frame he fixed his eye on that reclining panting figure and stepped lightly but firmly across the room to know the worst like a lion walking up to levelled lances chapter iii the young physician walked steadily up to his patient without taking his eye off her and drew a chair to her side then she took down one handthe leftand gave it him averting her face tenderly and still covering it with her right for said she to herself i am such a fright now this opportune reflection and her heaving bosom proved that she at least felt herself something more than his patient her pretty consciousness made his task more difficult nevertheless he only allowed himself to press her hand tenderly with both his palms one moment and then he entered on his functions bravely i am here as your physician very well said she softly he gently detained the hand and put his finger lightly to her pulse it was palpitating and a fallacious test oh how that beating pulse by loves electric current set his own heart throbbing in a moment he put her hand gently reluctantly down and said oblige me by turning this way she turned and he winced internally at the change in her but his face betrayed nothing he looked at her full and after a pause put her some questions one was as to the color of the hemorrhage she said it was bright red not a tinge of purple no said she hopefully mistaking him he suppressed a sigh then he listened at her shoulderblade and at her chest and made her draw her breath while he was listening the acts were simple and usual in medicine but there was a deep patient silent intensity about his way of doing them mr lusignan crept nearer and stood with both hands on a table and his old head bowed awaiting yet dreading the verdict up to this time dr staines instead of tapping and squeezing and pulling the patient about had never touched her with his hand and only grazed her with his ear but now he said allow me and put both hands to her waist more lightly and reverently than i can describe now draw a deep breath if you please there if you could draw a deeper still said he insinuatingly there then said she a little pettishly dr stainess eye kindled hum said he then after a considerable pause are you better or worse after each hemorrhage la said rosa they never asked me that why better no faintness not a bit rather a sense of relief perhaps yes i feel lighter and better the examination was concluded dr staines looked at rosa and then at her father the agony in that aged face and the love that agony implied won him and it was to the parent he turned to give his verdict the hemorrhage is from the lungs lusignan interrupted him from the lungs cried he in dismay yes a slight congestion of the lungs but not incurable oh not incurable doctor heaven forbid it is curableeasilyby removing the cause and what is the cause the causehe hesitated and looked rather uneasywell the cause sir istight stays the tranquillity of the meeting was instantly disturbed tight stays me cried rosa why i am the loosest girl in england look papa and without any apparent effort she drew herself in and poked her little fist between her sash and her gown there dr staines smiled sadly and a little sarcastically he was evidently shy of encountering the lady in this argument but he was more at his ease with her father so he turned towards him and lectured him freely that is wonderful sir and the first four or five female patients that favored me with it made me disbelieve my other senses but miss lusignan is now about the thirtieth who has shown me that marvellous feat with a calm countenance that belies the herculean effort nature has her everyday miracles a boaconstrictor diameter seventeen inches can swallow a buffalo a woman with her stays bisecting her almost and lacerating her skin can yet for one moment make herself seem slack to deceive a juvenile physician the snake is the miracle of expansion the woman is the prodigy of contraction highly grateful for the comparison cried rosa women and snakes dr staines blushed and looked uncomfortable i did not mean to be offensive it certainly was a very clumsy comparison what does that matter said mr lusignan impatiently be quiet rosa and let dr staines and me talk sense oh then i am nobody in the business said this wise young lady you are everybody said staines soothingly but suggested he obsequiously if you dont mind i would rather explain my views to your fatheron this one subject and a pretty subject it is dr staines then invited mr lusignan to his lodgings and promised to explain the matter anatomically meantime said he would you be good enough to put your hands to my waist as i did to the patients mr lusignan complied and the patient began to titter directly to put them out of countenance please observe what takes place when i draw a full breath now apply the same test to the patient breathe your best please miss lusignan the patient put on a face full of saucy mutiny to oblige us both oh how tiresome i am aware it is rather laborious said staines a little dryly but to oblige your father oh anything to oblige papa said she spitefully there and i do hope it will be the lastla no i dont hope that neither dr staines politely ignored her little attempts to interrupt the argument you found sir that the muscles of my waist and my intercostal ribs themselves rose and fell with each inhalation and exhalation of air by the lungs i did but my daughters waist was like dead wood and so were her lower ribs at this volunteer statement rosa colored to her temples thanks papa pack me off to london and sell me for a big doll in other words said the lecturer mild and pertinacious with us the lungs have room to blow and the whole bony frame expands elastic with them like the woodwork of a blacksmiths bellows but with this patient and many of her sex that noble and divinely framed bellows is crippled and confined by a powerful machine of human construction so it works lamely and feebly consequently too little air and of course too little oxygen passes through that spongy organ whose very life is air now mark the special result in this case being otherwise healthy and vigorous our patients system sends into the lungs more blood than that one crippled organ can deal with a small quantity becomes extravasated at odd times it accumulates and would become dangerous then nature strengthened by sleep and by some hours relief from the diabolical engine makes an effort and flings it off that is why the hemorrhage comes in the morning and why she is the better for it feeling neither faint nor sick but relieved of a weight this sir is the rationale of the complaint and it is to you i must look for the cure to judge from my other female patients and from the few words miss lusignan has let fall i fear we must not count on any very hearty cooperation from her but you are her father and have great authority i conjure you to use it to the full as you once used itto my sorrowin this very room i am forgetting my character i was asked here only as her physician goodevening he gave a little gulp and hurried away with an abruptness that touched the father and offended the sapient daughter however mr lusignan followed him and stopped him before he left the house and thanked him warmly and to his surprise begged him to call again in a day or two well rosa what do you say i say that i am very unfortunate in my doctors mr wyman is a chatterbox and knows nothing dr snell is mr wymans echo christopher is a genius and they are always full of crotchets a pretty doctor gone away and not prescribed for me mr lusignan admitted it was odd but after all said he if medicine does you no good ah but any medicine he had prescribed would have done me good and that makes it all the unkinder if you think so highly of his skill why not take his advice it can do no harm no harm why if i was to leave them off i should catch a dreadful cold and that would be sure to settle on my chest and carry me off in my present delicate state besides it is so unfeminine not to wear them this staggered mr lusignan and he was afraid to press the point but what staines had said fermented in his mind dr snell and mr wyman continued their visits and their prescriptions the patient got a little worse mr lusignan hoped christopher would call again but he did not when dr staines had satisfied himself that the disorder was easily curable then wounded pride found an entrance even into his loving heart that two strangers should have been consulted before him he was only sent for because they could not cure her as he seemed in no hurry to repeat his visit mr lusignan called on him and said politely he had hoped to receive another call ere this personally said he i was much struck with your observations but my daughter is afraid she will catch cold if she leaves off her corset and that you know might be very serious dr staines groaned and when he had groaned he lectured female patients are wonderfully monotonous in this matter they have a programme of evasions and whether the patient is a lady or a housemaid she seldom varies from that programme you find her breathing lifes air with half a bellows and you tell her so oh no says she and does the gigantic feat of contraction we witnessed that evening at your house but on inquiry you learn there is a raw red line ploughed in her flesh by the cruel stays what is that you ask and flatter yourself you have pinned her not a bit that was the last pair i changed them because they hurt me driven out of that by proofs of recent laceration they say if i leave them off i should catch my death of cold which is equivalent to saying there is no flannel in the shops no common sense nor needles at home he then laid before him some large french plates showing the organs of the human trunk and bade him observe in how small a space and with what skill the creator has packed so many large yet delicate organs so that they should be free and secure from friction though so close to each other he showed him the liver an organ weighing four pounds and of large circumference the lungs a very large organ suspended in the chest and impatient of pressure the heart the stomach the spleen all of them too closely and artfully packed to bear any further compression having thus taken him by the eye he took him by the mind is it a small thing for the creature to say to her creator i can pack all this eggchina better than you can and thereupon to jam all those vital organs close by a powerful a very powerful and ingenious machine is it a small thing for that sex which for good reasons the omniscient has made larger in the waist than the male to say to her creator you dont know your business women ought to be smaller in the waist than men and shall be throughout the civilized world in short he delivered so many true and pointed things on this trite subject that the old gentleman was convinced and begged him to come over that very evening and convince rosa dr staines shook his head dolefully and all his fire died out of him at having to face the fair reason will be wasted authority is the only weapon my profession and my reading have both taught me that the whole character of her sex undergoes a change the moment a man interferes with their dress from chaucers day to our own neither public satire nor private remonstrance has ever shaken any of their monstrous fashions easy obliging pliable and weaker of will than men in other things do but touch their dress however objectionable and rock is not harder iron is not more stubborn than these soft and yielding creatures it is no earthly use my comingill come he came that very evening and saw directly she was worse of course said he sadly you have not taken my advice rosa replied with a toss and an evasion i was not worth a prescription a physician can prescribe without sending his patient to the druggist and when he does then it is his words are gold rosa shook her head with an air of lofty incredulity he looked ruefully at mr lusignan and was silent rosa smiled sarcastically she thought he was at his wits end not quite he was cudgelling his brains in search of some horribly unscientific argument that might prevail for he felt science would fall dead upon so fair an antagonist at last his eye kindled he had hit on an argument unscientific enough for anybody he thought said he ingratiatingly you believe the old testament of course i do every syllable and the lessons it teaches certainly then let me tell you a story from that book a syrian general had a terrible disease he consulted elisha by deputy elisha said bathe seven times in a certain river jordan and you will get well the general did not like this at all he wanted a prescription wanted to go to the druggist didnt believe in hydropathy to begin and in any case turned up his nose at jordan what bathe in an israelitish brook when his own country boasted noble rivers with a reputation for sanctity into the bargain in short he preferred his leprosy to such irregular medicine but it happened by some immense fortuity that one of his servants though an oriental was a friend instead of a flatterer and this sensible fellow said if the prophet told you to do some great and difficult thing to get rid of this fearful malady would not you do it however distasteful and can you hesitate when he merely says wash in the jordan and be healed the general listened to good sense and cured himself your case is parallel you would take quantities of foul medicine you would submit to some painful operation if life and health depended on it then why not do a small thing for a great result you have only to take off an unnatural machine which cripples your growing frame and was unknown to every one of the women whose forms in parian marble the world admires off with that monstrosity and your cure is as certain as the syrian generals though science and not inspiration dictates the easy remedy rosa had listened impatiently and now replied with some warmth this is shockingly profane the idea of comparing yourself to elisha and me to a horrid leper much obliged not that i know what a leper is come come that is not fair said mr lusignan he only compared the situation not the people but papa the bible is not to be dragged into the common affairs of life then what on earth is the use of it oh papa well it is not sunday but i have had a sermon this is the clergyman and you are the commentatorhe he and so now let us go back from divinity to medicine i repeat this was the first time she had said it that my other doctors give me real prescriptions written in hieroglyphics you cant look at them without feeling there must be something in them an angry spot rose on christophers cheek but he only said and are your other doctors satisfied with the progress your disorder is making under their superintendence perfectly papa tell him what they say and ill find him their prescriptions she went to a drawer and rummaged affecting not to listen lusignan complied first of all sir i must tell you they are confident it is not the lungs but the liver the what shouted christopher ah screamed rosa oh dontbawling and dont you screech said her father with a look of misery and apprehension impartially distributed on the resounding pair you must have misunderstood them murmured staines in a voice that was now barely audible a yard off the hemorrhage of a bright red color and expelled without effort or nausea from the liverthey have assured me again and again said lusignan christophers face still wore a look of blank amazement till rosa herself confirmed it positively then he cast a look of agony upon her and started up in a passion forgetting once more that his host abhorred the sonorous oh shame shame he cried that the noble profession of medicine should be disgraced by ignorance such as this then he said sternly sir do not mistake my motives but i decline to have anything further to do with this case until those two gentlemen have been relieved of it and as this is very harsh and on my part unprecedented i will give you one reason out of many i could give you sir there is no road from the liver to the throat by which blood can travel in this way defying the laws of gravity and they knew from the patient that no strong expellent force has ever been in operation their diagnosis therefore implies agnosis or ignorance too great to be forgiven i will not share my patient with two gentlemen who know so little of medicine and know nothing of anatomy which is the a b c of medicine can i see their prescriptions these were handed to him good heavens said he have you taken all these most of them why then you have drunk about two gallons of unwholesome liquids and eaten a pound or two of unwholesome solids these medicines have cooperated with the malady the disorder lies not in the hemorrhage but in the precedent extravasation that is a drain on the system and how is the loss to be supplied why by taking a little more nourishment than before there is no other way and probably nature left to herself might have increased your appetite to meet the occasion but those two worthies have struck that weapon out of natures hand they have peppered away at the poor illused stomach with drugs and draughts not very deleterious i grant you but all more or less indigestible and all tending not to whet the appetite but to clog the stomach or turn the stomach or pester the stomach and so impair the appetite and so cooperate indirectly with the malady this is good sense said lusignan i declare ii wish i knew how to get rid of them oh ill do that papa no no it is not worth a rumpus ill do it too politely for that christopher you are very cleverterribly clever whenever i threw their medicines away i was always a little better that day i will sacrifice them to you it is a sacrifice they are both so kind and chatty and dont grudge me hieroglyphics now you do she sat down and wrote two sweet letters to dr snell and mr wyman thanking them for the great attention they had paid her but finding herself getting steadily worse in spite of all they had done for her she proposed to discontinue her medicines for a time and try change of air and suppose they call to see whether you are changing the air in that case papanot at home the notes were addressed and despatched then dr staines brightened up and said to lusignan i am now happy to tell you that i have overrated the malady the sad change i see in miss lusignan is partly due to the great bulk of unwholesome esculents she has been eating and drinking under the head of medicines these discontinued she might linger on for years existing though not livingthe tightlaced cannot be said to live but if she would be healthy and happy let her throw that diabolical machine into the fire it is no use asking her to loosen it she cant once there the temptation is too strong off with it and take my word you will be one of the healthiest and most vigorous young ladies in europe rosa looked rueful and almost sullen she said she had parted with her doctors for him but she really could not go about without stays they are as loose as they can be see that part of the programme is disposed of said christopher please go on to no how about the raw red line where the loose machine has sawed you what red line no such thing somebody or other has been peeping in at my window ill have the ivy cut down tomorrow simpleton said mr lusignan angrily you have let the cat out of the bag there is such a mark then and this extraordinary young man has discerned it with the eye of science he never discerned it at all said rosa red as fire and what is more he never will i dont want to i should be very sorry to i hope it will be gone in a week i wish you were gone nowexposing me in this cruel way said rosa angry with herself for having said an idiotic thing and furious with him for having made her say it oh rosa said christopher in a voice of tenderest reproach but mr lusignan interfered promptly rosa no noise i will not have you snapping at your best friend and mine if you are excited you had better retire to your own room and compose yourself i hate a clamor rosa made a wry face at this rebuke and then began to cry quietly every tear was like a drop of blood from christophers heart pray dont scold her sir said he ready to snivel himself she meant nothing unkind it is only her pretty sprightly way and she did not really imagine a love so reverent as mine dont you interfere between my father and me said this reasonable young lady now in an ungovernable state of feminine irritability no rosa said christopher humbly mr lusignan said he i hope you will tell her that from the very first i was unwilling to enter on this subject with her neither she nor i can forget my double character i have not said half as much to her as i ought being her physician and yet you see i have said more than she can bear from me who she knows love her and revere her then once for all do pray let me put this delicate matter into your hands it is a case for parental authority unfatherly tyranny that means said rosa what business have gentlemen interfering in such things it is unheard of i will not submit to it even from papa well you need not scream at me said mr lusignan and he shrugged his shoulders to staines she is impracticable you see if i do my duty there will be a disturbance now this roused the bile of dr staines what sir said he you could separate her and me by your authority here in this very room and yet when her life is at stake you abdicate you could part her from a man who loved her with every drop of his heartand she said she loved him or at all events preferred him to othersand you cannot part her from a miserable corset although you see in her poor wasted face that it is carrying her to the churchyard in that case sir there is but one thing for you to dowithdraw your opposition and let me marry her as her lover i am powerless but invest me with a husbands authority and you will soon see the roses return to her cheek and her elastic figure expanding and her eye beaming with health and the happiness that comes of perfect health mr lusignan made an answer neither of his hearers expected he said i have a great mind to take you at your word i am too old and fond of quiet to drive a simpleton in single harness this contemptuous speech and above all the word simpleton which had been applied to her pretty freely by young ladies at school and always galled her terribly inflicted so intolerable a wound on rosas vanity that she was ready to burst on that of course her stays contributed their mite of physical uneasiness thus irritated mind and body she burned to strike in return and as she could not slap her father in the presence of another she gave it christopher backhanded you can turn me out of doors said she if you are tired of your daughter but i am not such a simpleton as to marry a tyrant no he has shown the cloven foot in time a husbands authority indeed then she turned her hand and gave it him direct you told me a different story when you were paying your court to me then you were to be my servantall hypocritical sweetness you had better go and marry a circassian slave they dont wear stays and they do wear trousers so she will be unfeminine enough even for you no english lady would let her husband dictate to her about such a thing i can have as many husbands as i like without falling into the clutches of a tyrant you are a rude indelicateand so please understand it is all over between you and me both her auditors stood aghast for she uttered this conclusion with a dignity of which the opening gave no promise and the occasion weighed in masculine balances was not worthy you do not mean that you cannot mean it said dr staines aghast i do mean it said she firmly and if you are a gentleman you will not compel me to say it twicethree times i mean at this daggerstroke christopher turned very pale but he maintained his dignity i am a gentleman said he quietly and a very unfortunate one goodby sir thank you kindly goodby rosa god bless you oh pray take a thought remember your life and death are in your own hand now i am powerless and he left the house in sorrow and just but not pettish indignation when he was gone father and daughter looked at each other and there was the silence that succeeds a storm rosa feeling the most uneasy was the first to express her satisfaction there he is gone and i am glad of it now you and i shall never quarrel again i was quite right such impertinence such indelicacy a fine prospect for me if i had married such a man however he is gone and so theres an end of it the idea telling a young lady before her father she is tightlaced if you had not been there i could have forgiven him but i am not it is a story now suddenly exalting her voice i know you believe him i say nothing whispered papa hoping to still her by example this ruse did not succeed but you look volumes cried she and i cant bear it i wont bear it if you dont believe me ask my maid and with this felicitous speech she rang the bell youll break the wire if you dont mind suggested her father piteously all the better why should not wires be broken as well as my heart oh here she is now harriet come here yes miss and tell the truth am i tightlaced harriet looked in her face a moment to see what was required of her and then said that you are not miss i never dressed a young lady as wore em easier than you do there papa that will do harriet harriet retired as far as the keyhole she saw something was up now said rosa you see i was right and after all it was a match you did not approve well it is all over and now you may write to your favorite colonel bright if he comes here ill box his old ears i hate him i hate them all forgive your wayward girl ill stay with you all my days i dare say that will not be long now i have quarrelled with my guardian angel and all for what papa papa how can you sit there and not speak me one word of comfort simpleton ah that i am to throw away a love a queen is scarcely worthy of and all for what really if it wasnt for the ingratitude and wickedness of the thing it is too laughable ha haoh oh ohha ha ha and off she went into hysterics and began to gulp and choke frightfully her father cried for help in dismay in ran harriet saw and screamed but did not lose her head this veracious person whipped a pair of scissors off the table and cut the young ladys staylaces directly then there was a burst of imprisoned beauty a deep deep sigh of relief came from a bosom that would have done honor to diana and the scene soon concluded with fits of harmless weeping renewed at intervals when it had settled down to this her father to soothe her said he would write to dr staines and bring about a reconciliation if she liked no said she you shall kill me sooner i should die of shame she added oh pray from this hour never mention his name to me and then she had another cry mr lusignan was a sensible man he dropped the subject for the present but he made up his mind to one thingthat he would never part with dr staines as a physician next day rosa kept her own room until dinnertime and was as unhappy as she deserved to be she spent her time in sewing on stiff flannel linings and crying she half hoped christopher would write to her so that she might write back that she forgave him but not a line at halfpast six her volatile mind took a turn real or affected she would cry no more for an ungrateful fellowungrateful for not seeing through the stone walls how she had been employed all the morning and making it up so she bathed her red eyes made a great alteration in her dress and came dancing into the room humming an italian ditty as they were sitting together in the diningroom after dinner two letters came by the same post to mr lusignan from mr wyman and dr snell mr wymans letter dear siri am sorry to hear from miss lusignan that she intends to discontinue medical advice the disorder was progressing favorably and nothing to be feared under proper treatment yours etc dr snells letter dear sirmiss lusignan has written to me somewhat impatiently and seems disposed to dispense with my visits i do not however think it right to withdraw without telling you candidly that this is an unwise step your daughters health is in a very precarious condition yours etc rosa burst out laughing i have nothing to fear and im on the brink of the grave that comes of writing without a consultation if they had written at one table i should have been neither well nor ill poor christopher and her sweet face began to work piteously there there drink a glass of wine she did and a tear with it that ran into the glass like lightning warned by this that grief sat very near the bright hilarious surface mr lusignan avoided all emotional subjects for the present next day however he told her she might dismiss her lover but no power should make him dismiss his pet physician unless her health improved i will not give you that excuse for inflicting him on me again said the young hypocrite she kept her word she got better and better stronger brighter gayer she took to walking every day and increasing the distance till she could walk ten miles without fatigue her favorite walk was to a certain cliff that commanded a noble view of the sea to get to it she must pass through the town of gravesend and we may be sure she did not pass so often through that city without some idea of meeting the lover she had used so ill and eliciting an apology from him sly puss when she had walked twenty times or thereabouts through the town and never seen him she began to fear she had offended him past hope then she used to cry at the end of every walk but by and by bodily health vanity and temper combined to rouse the defiant spirit said she if he really loved me he would not take my word in such a hurry and besides why does he not watch me and find out what i am doing and where i walk at last she really began to persuade herself that she was an illused and slighted girl she was very angry at times and disconsolate at others a mixed state in which hasty and impulsive young ladies commit lifelong follies mr lusignan observed the surface only he saw his invalid daughter getting better every day till at last she became a picture of health and bodily vigor relieved of his fears he troubled his head but little about christopher staines yet he esteemed him and had got to like him but rosa was a beauty and could do better than marry a struggling physician however able he launched out into a little gayety resumed his quiet dinnerparties and after some persuasion took his now blooming daughter to a ball given by the officers of chatham she was the belle of the ball beyond dispute and danced with ethereal grace and athletic endurance she was madly fond of waltzing and here she encountered what she was pleased to call a divine dancer it was a mr reginald falcon a gentleman who had retired to the seaside to recruit his health and finances sore tried by london and paris falcon had run through his fortune but had acquired in the process certain talents which as they cost the acquirer dear so they sometimes repay him especially if he is not overburdened with principle and adopts the notion that the world having plucked him he has a right to pluck the world he could play billiards well but never so well as when backing himself for a heavy stake he could shoot pigeons well and his shooting improved under that which makes some marksmen missa heavy bet against the gun he danced to perfection and being a wellbred experienced brazen adroit fellow who knew a little of everything that was going he had always plenty to say above all he had made a particular study of the fair sex had met with many successes many rebuffs and at last by keen study of their minds and a habit he had acquired of watching their faces and shifting his helm accordingly had learned the great art of pleasing them they admired his face to me the short space between his eyes and his hair his aquiline nose and thin straight lips suggested the bird of prey a little too much but to fair doves born to be clutched this similitude perhaps was not very alarming even if they observed it rosa danced several times with him and told him he danced like an angel he informed her that was because for once he was dancing with an angel she laughed and blushed he flattered deliciously and it cost him little for he fell in love with her that night deeper than he had ever been in his whole life of intrigue he asked leave to call on her she looked a little shy at that and did not respond he instantly withdrew his proposal with an apology and a sigh that raised her pity however she was not a forward girl even when excited by dancing and charmed with her partner so she left him to find his own way out of that difficulty he was not long about it at the end of the next waltz he asked her if he might venture to solicit an introduction to her father oh certainly said she what a selfish girl i am this is terribly dull for him the introduction being made and rosa being engaged for the next three dances mr falcon sat by mr lusignan and entertained him for this little piece of apparent selfdenial he was paid in various coin lusignan found out he was the son of an old acquaintance and so the door of kent villa opened to him meantime rosa lusignan never passed him even in the arms of a cavalry officer without bestowing a glance of approval and gratitude on him what a goodhearted young man thought she how kind of him to amuse papa and now i can stay so much longer falcon followed up the dance by a call and was infinitely agreeable followed up the call by another and admired rosa with so little disguise that mr lusignan said to her i think you have made a conquest his father had considerable estates in essex i presume he inherits them oh never mind his estates said rosa he dances like an angel and gossips charmingly and is so nice christopher staines pined for this girl in silence his fine frame got thinner his pale cheek paler as she got rosier and rosier and how why by following the very advice she had snubbed him for giving her at last he heard she had been the belle of a ball and that she had been seen walking miles from home and blooming as a hebe then his deep anxiety ceased his pride stung him furiously he began to think of his own value and to struggle with all his might against his deep love sometimes he would even inveigh against her and call her a fickle ungrateful girl capable of no strong passion but vanity many a hard term he applied to her in his sorrowful solitude but not a word when he had a hearer he found it hard to rest he kept dashing up to london and back he plunged furiously into study he groaned and sighed and fought the hard and bitter fight that is too often the lot of the deep that love the shallow strong but singlehearted no other lady could comfort him he turned from female company and shunned all for the fault of one the inward contest wore him he began to look very thin and wan and all for a simpleton mr falcon prolonged his stay in the neighborhood and drove a handsome dogcart over twice a week to visit mr lusignan he used to call on that gentleman at four oclock for at that hour mr lusignan was always out and his daughter always at home she was at home at that hour because she took her long walks in the morning while her new admirer was in bed or dressing or breakfasting she was springing along the road with all the elasticity of youth and health and native vigor braced by daily exercise twentyone of these walks did she take with no other result than health and appetite but the twentysecond was more fertileextremely fertile starting later than usual she passed through gravesend while reginald falcon was smoking at his front window he saw her and instantly doffed his dressinggown and donned his coat to follow her he was madly in love with her and being a man who had learned to shoot pigeons and opportunities flying he instantly resolved to join her in her walk get her clear of the town by the seabeach where beauty melts and propose to her yes marriage had not been hitherto his habit but this girl was peerless he was pledged by honor and gratitude to phoebe dale but hang all that now no man should marry one woman when he loves another it is dishonorable he got into the street and followed her as fast as he could without running it was not so easy to catch her ladies are not built for running but a fine tall symmetrical girl who has practised walking fast can cover the ground wonderfully in walkingif she chooses it was a sight to see how rosa lusignan squared her shoulders and stepped out from the waist like a canadian girl skating while her elastic foot slapped the pavement as she spanked along she had nearly cleared the town before falcon came up with her he was hardly ten yards from her when an unexpected incident occurred she whisked round the corner of bird street and ran plump against christopher staines in fact she darted into his arms and her face almost touched the breast she had wounded so deeply chapter iv rosa cried oh and put up her hands to her face in lovely confusion coloring like a peony i beg your pardon said christopher stiffly but in a voice that trembled no said rosa it was i ran against you i walk so fast now hope i did not hurt you hurt me well then frighten you no answer oh please dont quarrel with me in the street said rosa cunningly implying that he was the quarrelsome one i am going on the beach goodby this adieu she uttered softly and in a hesitating tone that belied it she started off however but much more slowly than she was going before and as she went she turned her head with infinite grace and kept looking askant down at the pavement two yards behind her moreover she went close to the wall and left room at her side for another to walk christopher hesitated a moment but the mute invitation so arch yet timid so pretty tender sly and womanly was too much for him as it has generally proved for males and the philosophers foot was soon in the very place to which the simpleton with the mere tail of her eye directed it they walked along side by side in silence staines agitated gloomy confused rosa radiant and glowing yet not knowing what to say for herself and wanting christopher to begin so they walked along without a word falcon followed them at some distance to see whether it was an admirer or only an acquaintance a lover he never dreamed of she had shown such evident pleasure in his company and had received his visits alone so constantly however when the pair had got to the beach and were walking slower and slower he felt a pang of rage and jealousy turned on his heel with an audible curse and found phoebe dale a few yards behind him with a white face and a peculiar look he knew what the look meant he had brought it to that faithful face before today you are better miss lusignan better dr staines i am health itself thanks tohem our estrangement has agreed with you this very bitterly you know very well it is not that oh please dont make me cry in the streets this humble petition or rather meek threat led to another long silence it was continued till they had nearly reached the shore but meantime rosas furtive eyes scanned christophers face and her conscience smote her at the signs of suffering she felt a desire to beg his pardon with deep humility but she suppressed that weakness she hung her head with a pretty sheepish air and asked him if he could not think of something agreeable to say to one after deserting one so long i am afraid not said christopher bluntly i have an awkward habit of speaking the truth and some people cant bear that not even when it is spoken for their good that depends on temper and nerves and things said rosa deprecatingly then softly i could bear anything from you now indeed said christopher grimly well then i hear you had no sooner got rid of your old lover for loving you too well and telling you the truth than you took up anothersome flimsy man of fashion who will tell you any lie you like it is a story a wicked story cried rosa thoroughly alarmed me a lover he dances like an angel i cant help that are his visits at your house like angelsfew and far between and the true lovers brow lowered black upon her for the first time rosa changed color and her eyes fell a moment ask papa she said his father was an old friend of papas rosa you are prevaricating young men do not call on old gentlemen when there is an attractive young lady in the house the argument was getting too close so rosa operated a diversion so said she with a sudden air of lofty disdain swiftly and adroitly assumed you have had me watched not i i only hear what people say listen to gossip and not have me watched that shows how little you really cared for me well if you had you would have made a little discovery that is all should i said christopher puzzled what i shall not tell you think what you please yes sir you would have found out that i take long walks every day all alone and what is more that i walk through gravesend hopinglike a goosethat somebody really loved me and would meet me and beg my pardon and if he had i should have told him it was only my tongue and my nerves and things my heart was his and my gratitude and after all what do words signify when i am a good obedient girl at bottom so that is what you have lost by not condescending to look after me fine lovechristopher beg my pardon may i inquire for what why for not understanding me for not knowing that i should be sorry the moment you were gone i took them off the very next day to please you took off whomoh i understand you did then you are a good girl didnt i tell you i was a good obedient girl and anything but a flirt i dont say that but i do dont interrupt it is to your good advice i owe my health and to love anybody but you when i owe you my love and my life i must be a heartless ungrateful worthlessoh christopher forgive me no no i mean beg my pardon ill do both said christopher taking her in his arms i beg your pardon and i forgive you rosa leaned her head tenderly on his shoulder and began to sigh oh dear dear i am a wicked foolish girl not fit to walk alone on this admission christopher spoke out and urged her to put an end to all these unhappy misunderstandings and to his new torment jealousy by marrying him and so i would this very minute if papa would consent but said she slyly you never can be so foolish to wish it what a wise man like you marry a simpleton did i ever call you that asked christopher reproachfully no dear but you are the only one who has not and perhaps i should lose even the one if you were to marry me oh husbands are not so polite as lovers i have observed that simpleton or not christopher assured her that he took quite a different view of her character he believed her to be too profound for shallow people to read all in a moment he even intimated that he himself had experienced no little difficulty in understanding her at odd times and so said he they turn round upon you and instead of saying we are too shallow to fathom you they pretend you are a simpleton this solution of the mystery had never occurred to rosa nor indeed was it likely to occur to any creature less ingenious than a lover it pleased her hugely her fine eyes sparkled and she nestled closer still to the strong arm that was to parry every ill from mortal disease to galling epithets she listened with a willing ear to all his reasons his hopes his fears and when they reached her fathers door it was settled that he should dine there that day and urge his suit to her father after dinner she would implore the old gentleman to listen to it favorably the lovers parted and christopher went home like one who has awakened from a hideous dream to daylight and happiness he had not gone far before he met a dashing dogcart driven by an exquisite he turned to look after it and saw it drive up to kent villa in a moment he divined his rival and a sickness of heart came over him but he recovered himself directly and said if that is the fellow she will not receive him now she did receive him though at all events the dogcart stood at the door and its master remained inside christopher stood and counted the minutes five ten fifteen twenty minutes and still the dogcart stood there it was more than he could bear he turned savagely and strode back to gravesend resolving that all this torture should end that night one way or other phoebe dale was the daughter of a farmer in essex and one of the happiest young women in england till she knew reginald falcon esq she was reared on wholesome food in wholesome air and used to churn butter make bread cook a bit now and then cut out and sew all her own dresses get up her own linen make hay ride anything on four legs and for all that was a great reader and taught in the sunday school to oblige the vicar wrote a neat hand and was a good arithmetician kept all the house accounts and farm accounts she was a musician toonot profound but very correct she would take her turn at the harmonium in church and when she was there you never heard a wrong note in the bass nor an inappropriate flourish nor bad time she could sing too but never would except her part in a psalm her voice was a deep contralto and she chose to be ashamed of this heavenly organ because a pack of envious girls had giggled and said it was like a mans in short her natural ability and the range and variety of her useful accomplishments were considerable not that she was a prodigy but she belonged to a small class of women in this island who are not too high to use their arms nor too low to cultivate their minds and having a faculty and a habit deplorably rare amongst her sex viz attention she had profited by her miscellaneous advantages her figure and face both told her breed at once here was an old english pastoral beauty not the roundbacked narrowchested cottager but the wellfed erect rustic with broad full bust and massive shoulder and arm as hard as a rock with health and constant use a hand finely cut though neither small nor very white and just a little hard inside compared with luxurys soft palm a face honest fair and rather large than small not beautiful but exceedingly comely a complexion not pink and white but that delicately blended brickdusty color which tints the whole cheek in fine gradation outlasts other complexions twenty years and beautifies the true northern even in old age gray limpid honest pointblank searching eyes hair true nutbrown without a shade of red or black and a high smooth forehead full of sense across it ran one deep wrinkle that did not belong to her youth that wrinkle was the brand of trouble the line of agony it had come of loving above her yet below her and of loving an egotist three years before our tale commenced a gentlemans horse ran away with him and threw him on a heap of stones by the roadside not very far from farmer dales gate the farmer had him taken in the doctor said he must not be moved he was insensible his cheek like delicate wax his fair hair like silk stained with blood he became phoebes patient and in due course her convalescent his pale handsome face and fascinating manners gained one charm more from weakness his vices were in abeyance the womanly nurses heart yearned over her child for he was feeble as a child and when he got well enough to amuse his weary hours by making love to her and telling her a pack of arrant lies she was a ready dupe he was to marry her as soon as ever his old uncle died and left him the means etc etc at last he got well enough to leave her and went away her open admirer and secret lover he borrowed twenty pounds of her the day he left he used to write her charming letters and feed the flame but one day her father sent her up to london on his own business all of a sudden and she called on mr falcon at his real address she found he did not live thereonly received letters however halfacrown soon bought his real address and thither phoebe proceeded with a troubled heart for she suspected that her true lover was in debt or trouble and obliged to hide well he must be got out of it and hide at the farm meantime so the loving girl knocked at the door asked for mr falcon and was shown in to a lady rather showily dressed who asked her business phoebe dale stared at her and then turned pale as ashes she was paralyzed and could not find her tongue why what is the matter now said the other sharply are you married to reginald falcon of course i am look at my weddingring then i am not wanted here faltered phoebe ready to sink on the floor certainly not if you are one of the bygones said the woman coarsely and phoebe dale waited to hear no more but found her way heaven knows how into the street and there leaned halffainting on a rail till a policeman came and told her she had been drinking and suggested a cool cell as the best cure not drink only a breaking heart said she in her low mellow voice that few could resist he got her a glass of water drove away the boys that congregated directly and she left the street but she soon came back again and waited about for reginald falcon it was night when he appeared she seized him by the breast and taxed him with his villany what with her iron grasp pale face and flashing eyes he lost his cool impudence and blurted out excuses it was an old and unfortunate connection he would give the world to dissolve it if he could do it like a gentleman phoebe told him to please himself he must part with one or the other dont talk nonsense said this man of brass ill unfalcon her on the spot very well said phoebe i am going home and if you are not there by tomorrow at noonshe said no more but looked a great deal then she departed and refused him her hand at parting we will see about that by and by said she at noon my lord came down to the farm and unfortunately for phoebe played the penitent so skilfully for about a month that she forgave him and loved him all the more for having so nearly parted with him her peace was not to endure long he was detected in an intrigue in the very village the insult struck so home that phoebe herself to her parents satisfaction ordered him out of the house at once but when he was gone she had fits of weeping and could settle to nothing for a long time months had elapsed and she was getting a sort of dull tranquillity when one evening taking a walk she had often with him and mourning her solitude and wasted affection he waylaid her and clung to her knees and shed crocodile tears on her hands and after a long resistance violent at first but fainter and fainter got her in his power again and that so completely that she met him several times by night being ashamed to be seen with him in those parts by day this ended in fresh promises of marriage and in a constant correspondence by letter this pest knew exactly how to talk to a woman and how to write to one his letters fed the unhappy flame and mind you he sometimes deceived himself and thought he loved her but it was only himself he loved she was an invaluable lover a faithful disinterested friend hers was a vile bargain his an excellent one and he clung to it and so they went on she detected him in another infidelity and reproached him bitterly but she had no longer the strength to break with him nevertheless this time she had the sense to make a struggle she implored him on her very knees to show her a little mercy in return for all her love for pitys sake leave me she cried you are strong and i am weak you can end it forever and pray do you dont want me you dont value me then leave me once and for all and end this hell you keep me in no he could not or he would not leave her alone look at a birds wingshow like an angels yet so vile a thing as a bit of birdlime subdues them utterly and such was the fascinating power of this mean man over this worthy woman she was a reader a thinker a model of respectability industry and sense a businesswoman keen and practical could encounter sharp hands in sharp trades could buy or sell hogs calves or beasts with any farmer or butcher in the country yet no match for a cunning fool she had enshrined an idol in her heart and that heart adored it and clung to it though the superior head saw through it dreaded it despised it no wonder three years of this had drawn a telltale wrinkle across the polished brow phoebe dale had not received a letter for some days that roused her suspicion and stung her jealousy she came up to london by fast train and down to gravesend directly she had a thick veil that concealed her features and with a little inquiring and bribing she soon found out that mr falcon was there with a showy dogcart ah thought phoebe he has won a little money at play or pigeonshooting so now he has no need of me she took the lodgings opposite him but observed nothing till this very morning when she saw him throw off his dressinggown all in a hurry and fling on his coat she tied on her bonnet as rapidly and followed him until she discovered the object of his pursuit it was a surprise to her and a puzzle to see another man step in as if to take her part but as reginald still followed the loitering pair she followed reginald till he turned and found her at his heels white and lowering she confronted him in threatening silence for some time during which he prepared his defence so it is a lady this time said she in her low rich voice sternly is it yes and i should say she is bespokethat tall finebuilt gentleman but i suppose you care no more for his feelings than you do for mine phoebe said the egotist i will not try to deceive you you have often said you are my true friend and i think i have proved it that you have well then be my true friend now i am in lovereally in lovethis time you and i only torment each other let us part friends there are plenty of farmers in essex that would jump at you as for me ill tell you the truth i have run through every farthing my estate mortgaged beyond its valuetwo or three writs out against methat is why i slipped down here my only chance is to marry money her father knows i have land and he knows nothing about the mortgages she is his only daughter dont stand in my way that is a good girl be my friend as you always were hang it all phoebe cant you say a word to a fellow that is driven into a corner instead of glaring at me like that there i know it is ungrateful but what can a fellow do i must live like a gentleman or else take a dose of prussic acid you dont want to drive me to that why you proposed to part last time yourself she gave him one majestic indescribable look that made even his callous heart quiver and turned away then the scamp admired her for despising him and could not bear to lose her he followed her and put forth all those powers of persuading and soothing which had so often proved irresistible but this time it was in vain the insult was too savage and his egotism too brutal for honeyed phrases to blind her after enduring it a long time with a silent shudder she turned and shook him fiercely off her like some poisonous reptile do you want me to kill you id liever kill myself for loving such a thing as thou go thy ways man and let me go mine in her passion she dropped her cultivation for once and went back to the thou and thee of her grandam he colored up and looked spiteful enough but he soon recovered his cynical egotism and went off whistling an operatic passage she crept to her lodgings and buried her face in her pillow and rocked herself to and fro for hours in the bitterest agony the heart can feel groaning over her great affection wasted flung into the dirt while she was thus she heard a little commotion she came to the window and saw falcon exquisitely dressed drive off in his dogcart attended by the acclamations of eight boys she saw at a glance he was gone courting her knees gave way under her and such is the power of the mind this stalwart girl lay weak as water on the sofa and had not the power to go home though just then she had but one wish one hopeto see her idols face no more nor hear his wheedling tongue that had ruined her peace the exquisite mr falcon was received by rosa lusignan with a certain tremor that flattered his hopes he told her in charming language how he had admired her at first sight then esteemed her then loved her she blushed and panted and showed more than once a desire to interrupt him but was too polite she heard him out with rising dismay and he offered her his hand and heart but by this time she had made up her mind what to say o mr falcon she cried how can you speak to me in this way why i am engaged didnt you know no i am sure you are not or you would never have given me the encouragement you have oh all engaged young ladies flirta little and everybody here knows i am engaged to dr staines why i never saw him here rosas tact was a quality that came and went so she blushed and faltered out we had a little tiff as lovers will and you did me the honor to select me as catspaw to bring him on again was not that rather heartless rosas fitful tact returned to her oh sir do not think so ill of me i am not heartless i am only unwise and you are so superior to the people about you i could not help appreciating you and i thought you knew i was engaged and so i was less on my guard i hope i shall not lose your esteem though i have no right to anything more ah i see by your face i have behaved very ill pray forgive me and with this she turned on the waters of the nile better known to you perhaps as crocodile tears falcon was a gentleman on the surface and knew he should only make matters worse by quarrelling with her so he ground his teeth and said may your own heart never feel the pangs you have inflicted i shall love you and remember you till my dying day he bowed ceremoniously and left her ay said he to himself i will remember you you heartless jilt and the man you have jilted me for staines is his dd name is it he drove back crestfallen bitter and for once in his life heartsick and drew up at his lodgings here he found attendants waiting to receive him a sheriffs officer took his dogcart and horse under a judgment the disturbance this caused collected a tiny crowd gaping and grinning and brought phoebes white face and eyes swollen with weeping to the window falcon saw her and brazened it out take them said he with an oath ill have a better turnout by tomorrow breakfasttime the crowd cheered him for his spirit he got down lit a cigar chaffed the officer and the crowd and was on the whole admired then another officer who had been hunting him in couples with the other stepped forward and took him for the balance of a judgment debt then the swells cigar fell out of his mouth and he was seriously alarmed why cartwright said he this is too bad you promised not to see me this month you passed me full in the strand you are mistaken sir said cartwright with sullen irony ive got a twinbrother a many takes him for me till they finds the difference then lowering his voice what call had you to boast in your club you had made it right with bill cartwright and hed never see you that got about and so i was bound to see you or lose my bread theres one or two i dont see but then they are real gentlemen and thinks of me as well as theirselves and doesnt blab i must have been drunk said falcon apologetically more likely blowing a cloud when you young gents gets asmoking together youd tell on your own mothers come along colonel off we go to merrimashee why it is only twentysix pounds i have paid the rest more than that theres the costs come in and ill settle it all right sir jem watch the back oh i shall not try that game with a sharp hand like you cartwright you had better not sir said cartwright but he was softened a little by the compliment when they were alone falcon began by saying it was a bad job for him why i thought you was agoing to pay it all in a moment i cant but i have got a friend over the way that could if she chose she has always got money somehow oh if it is a she it is all right i dont know she has quarrelled with me but give me a little time here have a glass of sherry and a biscuit while i try it on having thus muffled cartwright this man of the world opened his window and looked out the crowd had followed the captured dogcart so he had the street to himself he beckoned to phoebe and after considerable hesitation she opened her window phoebe said he in tones of tender regret admirably natural and sweet i shall never offend you again so forgive me this once i have given that girl up not you said phoebe sullenly indeed i have after our quarrel i started to propose to her but i had not the heart i came back and left her time will show if it is not her it will be some other you false heartless villain come i say dont be so hard on me in trouble i am going to prison so i suppose ah but it is worse than you think i am only taken for a paltry thirty pounds or so thirtythree fifteen five suggested cartwright in a muffled whisper his mouth being full of biscuit but once they get me to a sponginghouse detainers will pour in and my cruel creditors will confine me for life it is the best place for you it will put a stop to your wickedness and i shall be at peace thats what i have never known night or day this three years but you will not be happy if you see me go to prison before your eyes were you ever inside a prison just think what it must be to be cooped up in those cold grim cells all alone for they use a debtor like a criminal now phoebe shuddered but she said bravely well tell them you have been acourting there was a time id have died sooner than see a hair of your head hurt but it is all over now you have worn me out then she began to cry falcon heaved a deep sigh it is no more than i deserve said he ill pack up my things and go with the officer give me one kind word at parting and ill think of it in my prison night and day he withdrew from the window with another deep sigh told cartwright cheerfully it was all right and proceeded to pack up his traps meantime phoebe sat at her window and cried bitterly her words had been braver than her heart falcon managed to pay the trifle he owed for the lodgings and presently he came out with cartwright and the attendant called a cab his things were thrown in and cartwright invited him to follow then he looked up and cast a genuine look of terror and misery at phoebe he thought she would have relented before this her heart gave way i am afraid it would even without that piteous and mute appeal she opened the window and asked mr cartwright if he would be good enough to come and speak to her cartwright committed his prisoner to the subordinate and knocked at the door of phoebes lodgings she came down herself and let him in she led the way upstairs motioned him to a seat sat down by him and began to cry again she was thoroughly unstrung cartwright was human and muttered some words of regret that a poor fellow must do his duty oh it is not that sobbed phoebe i can find the money i have found more for him than that manys the time then drying her eyes but you must know the world and i dare say you can see how tis with me i can said cartwright gravely i overheard you and him and my girl if you take my advice why let him go he is a gentleman skin deep and dresses well and can palaver a girl no doubt but bless your heart i can see at a glance he is not worth your little finger an honest decent young woman like you why it is like butter fighting with stone let him go or i will tell you what it is you will hang for him some day or else make away with yourself ay sir said phoebe thats likelier and if i was to let him go to prison i should sit me down and think of his parting look and i should fling myself into the water for him before i was a day older ye mustnt do that anyway while theres life theres hope upon this phoebe put him a question and found him ready to do anything for her in reasonprovided he was paid for it and the end of it all was the prisoner was conveyed to london phoebe got the requisite sum falcon was deposited in a thirdclass carriage bound for essex phoebe paid his debt and gave cartwright a present and away rattled the train conveying the handsome egotist into temporary retirement to wit at a village five miles from the dales farm she was too ashamed of her young gentleman and herself to be seen with him in her native village on the road down he was full of little practical attentions she received them coldly his mellifluous mouth was often at her car pouring thanks and praises into it she never vouchsafed a word of reply all she did was to shudder now and then and cry at intervals yet whenever he left her side her whole body became restless and when he came back to her a furtive thrill announced the insane complacency his bare contact gave her surely of all the forms in which love torments the heart this was the most terrible and pitiable mr lusignan found his daughter in tears why what is the matter now said he a little peevishly we have had nothing of this sort of thing lately papa it is because i have misconducted myself i am a foolish imprudent girl i have been flirting with mr falcon and he has taken a cruel advantage of itproposed to methis very afternoonactually has he well he is a fine fellow and has a landed estate in norfolk theres nothing like land they may well call it real propertythere is something to show you can walk on it and ride on it and look out of window at it that is property oh papa what are you saying would you have me marry one man when i belong to another but you dont belong to any one except to me oh yes i do i belong to my dear christopher why you dismissed him before my very eyes and very ill you behaved begging your pardon the man was your able physician and your best friend and said nothing that was not for your good and you treated him like a dog yes but he has apologized what for being treated like a dog oh dont say so papa at all events he has apologized as a gentleman should wheneverwhenever whenever a lady is in the wrong dont papa and i have asked him to dinner with all my heart i shall be downright glad to see him again you used him abominably but you need not keep saying so whined rosa and that is not all dear papa the worst of it is mr falcon proposing to me has opened my eyes i am not fit to be trusted alone i am too fond of dancing and flirting will follow somehow oh think how ill i was a few months ago and how unhappy you were about me they were killing me he came and saved me yes papa i owe all this health and strength to christopher i did take them off the very next day and see the effect of it and my long walks i owe him my life and what i value far more my good looks la i wish i had not told you that and after all this dont i belong to my christopher how could i be happy or respect myself if i married any one else and oh papa he looks wan and worn he has been fretting for his simpleton oh dear i mustnt think of thatit makes me cry and you dont like scenes do you hate em well then said rosa coaxingly ill tell you how to end them marry your simpleton to the only man who is fit to take care of her oh papa think of his deep deep affection for me and pray dont snub him ifby any chanceafter dinnerhe should happen to ask yousomething oh then it is possible that by the merest chance the gentleman you have accidentally asked to dinner may by some strange fortuity be surprised into asking me a second time for something very much resembling my daughters handeh rosa colored high he might you know how can i tell what gentlemen will say when the ladies have retired and they are left alone withwith with the bottle ay thats true when the wine is in the wit is out said rosa well if he should happen to be so foolish pray think of me of all we owe him and how much i love him and ought to love him she then bestowed a propitiatory kiss and ran off to dress for dinner it was a much longer operation today than usual dr staines was punctual mr lusignan commented favorably on that he always is said rosa eagerly they dined together mr lusignan chatted freely but staines and rosa were under a feeling of restraint staines in particular he could not help feeling that before long his fate must be settled he would either obtain rosas hand or have to resign her to some man of fortune who would step in for beauty such as hers could not long lack brilliant offers longing though dreading to know his fate he was glad when dinner ended rosa sat with them a little while after dinner then rose bestowed another propitiatory kiss on her fathers head and retired with a modest blush and a look at christopher that was almost divine it inspired him with the courage of lions and he commenced the attack at once chapter v mr lusignan said he the last time i was here you gave me some hopes that you might be prevailed on to trust that angels health and happiness to my care well dr staines i will not beat about the bush with you my judgment is still against this marriage you need not look so alarmed it does not follow i shall forbid it i feel i have hardly a right to for my rosa might be in her grave now but for you and another thing when i interfered between you two i had no proof you were a man of ability i had only your sweethearts word for that and i never knew a case before where a young ladys swan did not turn out a goose your rare ability gives you another chance in the professional battle that is before you indeed it puts a different face on the whole matter i still think it premature come now would it not be much wiser to wait and secure a good practice before you marry a mere child there there i only advise i dont dictate you shall settle it together you two wiseacres only i must make one positive condition i have nothing to give my child during my lifetime but one thing i have done for her years ago i insured my life for six thousand pounds and you must do the same i will not have her thrown on the world a widow with a child or two perhaps to support and not a farthing you know the insecurity of mortal life i do i do why of course i will insure my life and pay the annual premium out of my little capital until income flows in will you hand me over a sum sufficient to pay that premium for five years with pleasure then i fear said the old gentleman with a sigh my opposition to the match must cease here i still recommend you to wait butthere i might just as well advise fire and tow to live neighbors and keep cool to show the injustice of this simile christopher staines started up with his eyes all aglow and cried out rapturously oh sir may i tell her yes you may tell her said lusignan with a smile stopwhat are you going to tell her that you consent sir god bless you god bless you oh yes but that i advise you to wait ill tell her all said staines and rushed out even as he spoke and upset a heavy chair with a loud thud ah ah cried the old gentleman in dismay and put his fingers in his earstoo late i see said he there will be no peace and quiet now till they are out of the house he lighted a soothing cigar to counteract the fracas poor little rosa a child but yesterday and now to encounter the cares of a wife and perhaps a mother ah she is but young but young the old gentleman prophesied truly from that moment he had no peace till he withdrew all semblance of dissent and even of procrastination christopher insured his life for six thousand pounds and assigned the policy to his wife four hundred pounds was handed to mr lusignan to pay the premiums until the genius of dr staines should have secured him that large professional income which does not come all at once even to the rare physician who is capax efficax sagax the weddingday was named the bridesmaids were selected the guests invited none refused but uncle philip he declined in his fine bold hand to countenance in person an act of folly he disapproved christopher put his letter away with a momentary sigh and would not show it rosa all other letters they read together charming pastime of that happy period presents poured in silver teapots coffeepots sugarbasins creamjugs fruitdishes silvergilt inkstands albums photographbooks little candlesticks choice little services of china shell saltcellars in a case lined with maroon velvet a bible superb in binding and clasps and everything but the textthat was illegible a silk scarf from benares a gold chain from delhi six feet long or nearly a maltese necklace a ditto in exquisite filagree from genoa english brooches a trifle too big and brainless apostle spoons a treblelined parasol with ivory stick and handle an ivory cardcase richly carved workbox of sandalwood and ivory etc mr lusignans city friends as usual with these gentlemen sent the most valuable things every day one or two packages were delivered and in opening them rosa invariably uttered a peculiar scream of delight and her father put his fingers in his ears yet there was music in this very scream if he would only have listened to it candidly instead of fixing his mind on his vague theory of screamsso formed was she to please the ear as well as the eye at last came a parcel she opened and stared at smiling and coloring like a rose but did not scream being too dumfounded and perplexed for lo a teapot of some base material but simple and elegant in form being an exact reproduction of a melon and inside this teapot a canvas bag containing ten guineas in silver and a washleather bag containing twenty guineas in gold and a slip of paper which rosa being now half recovered from her stupefaction read out to her father and dr staines people that buy presents blindfold give duplicates and triplicates and men seldom choose to a womans taste so be pleased to accept the enclosed tealeaves and buy for yourself the teapot you can put on the hob for it is nickel rosa looked sore puzzled again papa said she timidly have we any friend that isa littlederanged a lot oh then that accounts why no love said christopher i have heard of much learning making a man mad but never of much good sense what do you call this sensible dont you ill read it again said rosa wellyesi declareit is not so mad as i thought but it is very eccentric lusignan suggested there was nothing so eccentric as common sense especially in time of wedding this said he comes from the city it is a friend of mine some old fox he is throwing dust in your eyes with his reasons his real reason was that his time is money it would have cost the old rogue a hundred pounds worth of timeyou know the city christopherto go out and choose the girl a present so he has sent his clerk out with a check to buy a pewter teapot and fill it with specie pewter cried rosa no such thing its nickel what is nickel i wonder the handwriting afforded no clew so there the discussion ended but it was a nice little mystery and very convenient made conversation rosa had many an animated discussion about it with her female friends the weddingday came at last the sun shoneactually as rosa observed the carriages drove up the bridesmaids principally old schoolfellows and impassioned correspondents of rosa were pretty and dressed alike and delightfully but the bride was peerless her southern beauty literally shone in that white satin dress and veil and her head was regal with the crown of orangeblossoms another crown she hadtrue virgin modesty a low murmur burst from the men the moment they saw her the old women forgave her beauty on the spot and the young women almost pardoned it she was so sweet and womanly and so sisterly to her own sex when they started for the church she began to tremble she scarce knew why and when the solemn words were said and the ring was put on her finger she cried a little and looked half imploringly at her bridesmaids once as if seared at leaving them for an untried and mysterious life with no woman near they were married then came the breakfast that hour of uneasiness and blushing to such a bride as this but at last she was released she sped upstairs thanking goodness it was over down came her last box the bride followed in a plain travelling dress which her glorious eyes and brows and her rich glowing cheeks seemed to illumine she was handed into the carriage the bridegroom followed all the young guests clustered about the door armed with white shoesslippers are gone by they started the ladies flung their white shoes right and left with religious impartiality except that not one of their missiles went at the object the men more skilful sent a shower on to the roof of the carriage which is the lucky spot the bride kissed her hand and managed to put off crying though it cost her a struggle the party hurrahed enthusiastic youths gathered fallen shoes and ran and hurled them again with cheerful yells and away went the happy pair the bride leaning sweetly and confidingly with both her white hands on the bridegrooms shoulder while he dried the tears that would run now at leaving home and parent forever and kissed her often and encircled her with his strong arm and murmured comfort and love and pride and joy and sweet vows of lifelong tenderness into her ears that soon stole nearer his lips to hear and the fair cheek grew softly to his shoulder chapter vi dr staines and mrs staines visited france switzerland and the rhine and passed a month of elysium before they came to london to face their real destiny and fight the battle of life and here methinks a reader of novels may perhaps cry out and say what manner of man is this who marries his hero and heroine and then instead of leaving them happy for life and at rest from his uneasy pen and all their other troubles flows coolly on with their adventures to this i can only reply that the old english novel is no rule to me and life is and i respectfully propose an experiment catch eight old married people four of each sex and say unto them sir or madam did the more remarkable events of your life come to you before marriage or after most of them will say after and let that be my excuse for treating the marriage of christopher staines and rosa lusignan as merely one incident in their lives an incident which so far from ending their story led by degrees to more striking events than any that occurred to them before they were man and wife they returned then from their honey tour and staines who was methodical and kept a diary made the following entry therein we have now a life of endurance and selfdenial and economy before us we have to rent a house and furnish it and live in it until professional income shall flow in and make all things easy and we have two thousand five hundred pounds left to do it with they came to a family hotel and dr staines went out directly after breakfast to look for a house acting on a friends advice he visited the streets and places north of oxford street looking for a good commodious house adapted to his business he found three or four at fair rents neither cheap nor dear the district being respectable and rather wealthy but no longer fashionable he came home with his notes and found rosa beaming in a crisp peignoir and her lovely head its natural size and shape highbred and elegant he sat down and with her hand in his proceeded to describe the houses to her when a waiter threw open the doormrs john cole florence cried rosa starting up in flowed florence they both uttered a little squawk of delight and went at each other like two little tigresses and kissed in swift alternation with a singular ardor drawing their crests back like snakes and then darting them forward and inflicting what to the male philosopher looking on seemed hard kisses violent kisses rather than the tender ones to be expected from two tender creatures embracing each other darling said rosa i knew you would be the first didnt i tell you so christophermy husbandmy darling florry sit down love and tell me everything he has just been looking out for a house ah you have got all that over long ago she has been married six months florry you are handsomer than ever and what a beautiful dress ah london is the place real brussels i declare and she took hold of her friends lace and gloated on it christopher smiled goodnaturedly and said i dare say you ladies have a good deal to say to each other oceans said rosa i will go and hunt houses again theres a good husband said mrs cole as soon as the door closed on him and such a fine man why he must be six feet mine is rather short but he is very good refuses me nothing my will is law that is all rightyou are so sensible but i want governing a little and i like itactually did the dressmaker find it dear oh no i had it by me i bought it at brussels on our wedding tour it is dearer there than in london she said this as if dearer and better were synonymous but about your house rosie dear yes darling ill tell you all about it i never saw a moire this shade before i dont care for them in general but this is so distingue florence rewarded her with a kiss the house said rosa oh he has seen one in portman street and one in gloucester place oh that will never do cried mrs cole it is no use being a physician in those outoftheway places he must be in mayfair must he of course besides then my johnnie can call him in when they are just going to die johnnie is a general prac and makes two thousand a year and he shall call your one in but he must live in mayfair why rosie you would not be such a goose as to live in those placesthey are quite gone by i shall do whatever you advise me dear oh what a comfort to have a dear friend and six months married and knows things how richly it is trimmed why it is nearly all trimmings that is the fashion oh and after that big word there was no more to be said these two ladies in their conversation gravitated towards dress and fell flat on it every halfminute that great and elevating topic held them by a silken cord but it allowed them to flutter upwards into other topics and in those intervals numerous though brief the lady who had been married six months found time to instruct the matrimonial novice with great authority and even a shade of pomposity my dear the way ladies and gentlemen get a housein the first place you dont go about yourself like that and you never go to the people themselves or you are sure to be taken in but to a respectable houseagent yes dear that must be the best way one would think of course it is and you ask for a house in mayfair and he shows you several and recommends you the best and sees you are not cheated thank you love said rosa now i know what to do ill not forget a word and the train so beautifully shaped ah it is only in london or paris they can make a dress flow behind like that etc etc dr staines came back to dinner in good spirits he had found a house in harewood square good entrance hall where his gratuitous patients might sit on benches good diningroom where his superior patients might wait and good library to be used as a consultingroom rent only eightyfive pounds per annum but rosa told him that would never do a physician must be in the fashionable part of the town eventually said christopher but surely at first startingand you know they say little boats should not go too far from shore then rosa repeated all her friends arguments and seemed so unhappy at the idea of not living near her that staines who had not yet said the hard word no to her gave in consoling his prudence with the reflection that after all mr cole could put many a guinea in his way for mr cole was middleagedthough his wife was youngand had really a very large practice so next day the newlywedded pair called on a houseagent in mayfair and his son and partner went with them to several places the rents of houses equal to that in harewood square were three hundred pounds a year at least and a premium to boot christopher told him these were quite beyond the mark very well said the agent then ill show you a bijou rosa clapped her hands that is the thing for us we dont want a large house only a beautiful one and in mayfair then the bijou will be sure to suit you he took them to the bijou the bijou had a small diningroom with one very large window in two sheets of plate glass and a projecting balcony full of flowers a still smaller library which opened on a square yard enclosed here were a great many pots with flowers dead or dying from neglect on the first floor a fairsized drawingroom and a tiny one at the back on the second floor one good bedroom and a dressingroom or little bedroom three garrets above rosa was in ecstasies it is a nest said she it is a banknote said the agent stimulating equal enthusiasm after his fashion you can always sell the lease again for more money christopher kept cool i dont want a house to sell but to live in and do my business i am a physician now the drawingroom is built over the entrance to a mews the back rooms all look into a mews we shall have the eternal noise and smell of a mews my wifes rest will be broken by the carriages rolling in and out the hall is fearfully small and stuffy the rent is abominably high and what is the premium for i wonder always a premium in mayfair sir a lease is property here the gentleman is not acquainted with this part madam oh yes he is said rosa as boldly as a six years wife he knows everything then he knows that a house of this kind at a hundred and thirty pounds a year in mayfair is a banknote staines turned to rosa the poor patients where am i to receive them in the stable suggested the house agent oh said rosa shocked well then the coachhouse why theres plenty of room for a brougham and one horse and fifty poor patients at a time beggars musnt be choosers if you give them physic gratis that is enough you aint bound to find em a palace to sit down in and hot coffee and rump steaks all round doctor this tickled rosa so that she burst out laughing and thenceforward giggled at intervals wit of this refined nature having all the charm of novelty for her they inspected the stables which were indeed the one redeeming feature in the horrid little bijou and then the agent would show them the kitchen and the new stove he expatiated on this to mrs staines cook a dinner for thirty people madam and theres room for them to eat itin the road said staines the agent reminded him there were larger places to be had by a very simple process viz paying for them staines thought of the large comfortable house in harewood square one hundred and thirty pounds a year for this poky little hole he groaned why it is nothing at all for a bijou but it is too much for a bandbox rosa laid her hand on his arm with an imploring glance well said he ill submit to the rent but i really cannot give the premium it is too ridiculous he ought to bribe me to rent it not i him cant be done without sir well ill give a hundred pounds and no more impossible sir then good morning now dearest just come and see the house at harewood squareeightyfive pounds and no premium will you oblige me with your address doctor said the agent dr staines morleys hotel and so they left mayfair rosa sighed and said oh the nice little place and we have lost it for two hundred pounds two hundred pounds is a great deal for us to throw away being near the coles would soon have made that up to you and such a cosey little nest well the house will not run away but somebody is sure to snap it up it is a bijou she was disappointed and half inclined to pout but she vented her feelings in a letter to her beloved florry and appeared at dinner as sweet as usual during dinner a note came from the agent accepting dr staines offer he glozed the matter thus he had persuaded the owner it was better to take a good tenant at a moderate loss than to let the bijou be uninhabited during the present rainy season an assignment of the leasewhich contained the usual covenantswould be prepared immediately and dr staines could have possession in fortyeight hours by paying the premium rosa was delighted and as soon as dinner was over and the waiters gone she came and kissed christopher he smiled and said well you are pleased that is the principal thing i have saved two hundred pounds and that is something it will go towards furnishing la yes said rosa i forgot we shall have to get furniture now how nice it was a pleasure the man of forecast could have willingly dispensed with but he smiled at her and they discussed furniture and christopher whose retentive memory had picked up a little of everything said there were wholesale upholsterers in the city who sold cheaper than the westend houses and he thought the best way was to measure the rooms in the bijou and go to the city with a clear idea of what they wanted ask the prices of various necessary articles and then make a list and demand a discount of fifteen per cent on the whole order being so considerable and paid for in cash rosa acquiesced and told christopher he was the cleverest man in england about nine oclock mrs cole came in to condole with her friend and heard the good news when rosa told her how they thought of furnishing she said oh no you must not do that you will pay double for everything that is the mistake johnnie and i made and after that a friend of mine took me to the auctionrooms and i saw everything soldoh such bargains half and less than half their value she has furnished her house almost entirely from sales and she has the loveliest things in the worldsuch ducks of tables and jardinieres and things and beautiful rare chinaher house swarms with itfor an old song a sale is the place and then so amusing yes but said christopher i should not like my wife to encounter a public room not alone of course but with me la dr staines they are too full of buying and selling to trouble their heads about us oh christopher do let me go with her am i always to be a child thus appealed to before a stranger staines replied warmly no dearest no you cannot please me better than by beginning life in earnest if you two ladies together can face an auctionroom go by all means only i must ask you not to buy china or ormulu or anything that will break or spoil but only solid good furniture wont you come with us no or you might feel yourself in leadingstrings remember the bijou is a small house choose your furniture to fit it and then we shall save something by its being so small this was wednesday there was a weekly sale in oxford street on fridays and the ladies made the appointment accordingly next day after breakfast christopher was silent and thoughtful awhile and at last said to rosa ill show you i dont look on you as a child ill consult you in a delicate matter rosas eyes sparkled it is about my uncle philip he has been very cruel he has wounded me deeply he has wounded me through my wife i never thought he would refuse to come to our marriage and did he you never showed me his letter you were not my wife then i kept an affront from you but now you see i keep nothing dear christie i am so happy i have got over that stingalmost and the memory of many kind acts comes back to me and i dont know what to do it seems ungrateful not to visit himit seems almost mean to call ill tell you take me to see him directly he wont hate us forever if he sees us often we may as well begin at once nobody hates me long christopher was proud of his wifes courage and wisdom he kissed her begged her to put on the plainest dress she could and they went together to call on uncle philip when they got to his house in gloucester place portman square rosas heart began to quake and she was right glad when the servant said not at home they left their cards and address and she persuaded christopher to take her to the saleroom to see the things a lot of brokers were there like vultures and one after another stepped forward and pestered them to employ him in the morning dr staines declined their services civilly but firmly and he and rosa looked over a quantity of furniture and settled what sort of things to buy another broker came up and whenever the couple stopped before an article proceeded to praise it as something most extraordinary staines listened in cold satirical silence and told his wife in french to do the same notwithstanding their marked disgust the impudent intrusive fellow stuck to them and forced his venal criticism on them and made them uncomfortable and shortened their tour of observation i think i shall come with you tomorrow said christopher or i shall have these blackguards pestering you oh florry will send them to the rightabout she is as brave as a lion next day dr staines was sent for into the city at twelve to pay the money and receive the lease of the bijou and this and the taking possession occupied him till four oclock when he came to his hotel meantime his wife and mrs cole had gone to the auctionroom it was a large room with a good sprinkling of people but not crowded except about the table at the head of this tablefull twenty feet longwas the auctioneers pulpit and the lots were brought in turn to the other end of the table for sight and sale we must try and get a seat said the enterprising mrs cole and pushed boldly in the timid rosa followed strictly in her wake and so evaded the human waves her leader clove they were importuned at every step by brokers thrusting catalogues on them with offers of their services yet they soon got to the table a gentleman resigned one chair a broker another and they were seated mrs staines let down half her veil but mrs cole surveyed the company pointblank the broker who had given up his seat and now stood behind rosa offered her his catalogue no thank you said rosa i have one and she produced it and studied it yet managed to look furtively at the company there were not above a dozen private persons visible from where rosa sat perhaps as many more in the whole room they were easily distinguishable by their cleanly appearance the dealers male or female were more or less rusty greasy dirty aquiline not even the amateurs were brightly dressed that fundamental error was confined to mesdames cole and staines the experienced however wealthy do not hunt bargains in silk and satin the auctioneer called lot four saucepans two trays a kettle a bootjack and a towelhorse these were put up at two shillings and speedily knocked down for five to a fat old woman in a greasy velvet jacket blind industry had sewed bugles on it not artfully but agriculturally the lady on the left said the auctioneer to his clerk that meant get the money the old lady plunged a huge paw into a huge pocket and pulled out a huge handful of coincopper silver and goldand paid for the lot and rosa surveyed her dirty hands and nails with innocent dismay oh what a dreadful creature she whispered and what can she want with those old rubbishy things i saw a hole in one from here the broker overheard and said she is a dealer maam and the things were given away shell sell them for a guinea easy didnt i tell you said mrs cole soon after this the superior lots came on and six very neat bedroom chairs were sold to all appearance for fifteen shillings the next lot was identical and rosa hazarded a bidsixteen shillings instantly some dealer one of the hooknosed that gathered round each lot as it came to the foot of the table cried eighteen shillings nineteen said rosa a guinea said the dealer dont let it go said the broker behind her dont let it go maam she colored at the intrusion and left off bidding directly and addressed herself to mrs cole why should i give so much when the last were sold for fifteen shillings the real reason was that the first lot was not bid for at all except by the proprietor however the broker gave her a very different solution he said the trade always run up a lady or a gentleman let me bid for you they wont run me up they know better rosa did not reply but looked at mrs cole yes dear said that lady you had much better let him bid for you very well said rosa you can bid for this chest of drawerslot when lot came on the broker bid in the silliest possible way if his object had been to get a bargain he began to bid early and ostentatiously the article was protected by somebody or other there present who now of course saw his way clear he ran it up audaciously and it was purchased for rosa at about the price it could have been bought for at a shop the next thing she wanted was a set of oak chairs they went up to twentyeight pounds then she said i shall give no more sir better not lose them said the agent they are a great bargain and bid another pound for her on his own responsibility they were still run up and rosa peremptorily refused to give any more she lost them accordingly by good luck her faithful broker looked blank so did the proprietor but as the sale proceeded she being young the competition though most of it sham being artful and exciting and the traitor she employed constantly puffing every article she was drawn in to wishing for things and bidding by her feelings then her traitor played a game that has been played a hundred times and the perpetrators never once lynched as they ought to be on the spot he signalled a confederate with a hooked nose the jew rascal bid against the christian scoundrel and so they ran up the more enticing things to twice their value under the hammer rosa got flushed and her eye gleamed like a gamblers and she bought away like wildfire in which sport she caught sight of an old gentleman with little black eyes that kept twinkling at her she complained of these eyes to mrs cole why does he twinkle so i can see it is at me i am doing something foolishi know i am mrs cole turned and fixed a haughty stare on the old gentleman would you believe it instead of sinking through the floor he sat his ground and retorted with a cold clear grin but now whenever rosas agent bid for her and the other man of straw against him the black eyes twinkled and rosas courage began to ooze away at last she said that is enough for one day i shall go who could bear those eyes the broker took her address so did the auctioneers clerk the auctioneer asked her for no deposit her beautiful innocent and highbred face was enough for a man who was always reading faces and interpreting them and so they retired but this charming sex is like that same auctioneers hammer it cannot go abruptly it is always goinggoinggoinga long time before it is gone i think it would perhaps loiter at the door of a jail with the order of release in its hand after six years confinement getting up to go quenches in it the desire to go so these ladies having got up to go turned and lingered and hung fire so long that at last another set of oak chairs came up oh i must see what these go for said rosa at the door the bidding was mighty languid now rosas broker was not stimulating it and the auctioneer was just knocking down twelve chairsoak and leatherand two armchairs for twenty pounds when casting his eyes around he caught sight of rosa looking at him rather excited he looked inquiringly at her she nodded slightly he knocked them down to her at twenty guineas and they were really a great bargain twentytwo cried the dealer too late said the auctioneer i spoke with the hammer sir after the hammer isaacs shelp me god we was together one or two more of his tribe confirmed this pious falsehood and clamored to have them put up again call the next lot said the auctioneer peremptorily make up your mind a little quicker next time mr isaacs you have been long enough at it to know the value of oak and moroccar mrs staines and her friend now started for morleys hotel but went round by regent street whereby they got glued at peter robinsons window and nine other windows and it was nearly five oclock when they reached morleys as they came near the door of their sittingroom mrs staines heard somebody laughing and talking to her husband the laugh to her subtle ears did not sound musical and genial but keen satirical unpleasant so it was with some timidity she opened the door and there sat the old chap with the twinkling eyes both parties stared at each other a moment why it is them cried the old gentleman ha ha ha ha ha rosa colored all over and felt guilty somehow and looked miserable rosa dear said dr staines this is our uncle philip oh said rosa and turned red and pale by turns for she had a great desire to propitiate uncle philip you were in the auctionroom sir said mrs cole severely i was madam he he furnishing a house no maam i go to a dozen sales a week but it is not to buyi enjoy the humors did you ever hear of robert burton maam no yes a great traveller isnt he discovered the nileor the nigeror something this majestic vagueness staggered old crusty at first but he recovered his equilibrium and said why yes now i think of it you are right he has travelled farther than most of us for about two centuries ago he visited that bourn whence no traveller returns well when he was alivehe was a student of christchurchhe used to go down to a certain bridge over the isis and enjoy the chaff of the bargemen now there are no bargemen left to speak of the mantle of bobby burtons bargees has fallen on the jews and demisemichristians that buy and sell furniture at the weekly auctions thither i repair to hear what little coarse wit is left us used to go to the house of commons but they are getting too civil by half for my money besides characters come out in an auction for instance only this very day i saw two ladies enter in gorgeous attire like heifers decked for sacrifice and reduce their spoliation to a certainty by employing a broker to bid now what is a broker a fellow who is to be paid a shilling in the pound for all articles purchased what is his interest then to buy cheap clearly not he is paid in proportion to the dearness of the article rosas face began to work piteously accordingly what did the broker in question do he winked to another broker and these two bid against one another over their victims head and ran everything she wanted up at least a hundred per cent above the value so open and transparent a swindle i have seldom seen even in an auctionroom ha ha ha ha ha his mirth was interrupted by rosa going to her husband hiding her head on his shoulder and meekly crying christopher comforted her like a man dont you cry darling said he how should a pure creature like you know the badness of the world all in a moment if it is my wife you are laughing at uncle philip let me tell you this is the wrong place id rather a thousand times have her as she is than armed with the cunning and suspicions of a hardened old worldling like you with all my heart said uncle philip who to do him justice could take blows as well as give them but why employ a broker why pay a scoundrel five per cent to make you pay a hundred per cent why pay a noisy fool a farthing to open his mouth for you when you have taken the trouble to be there yourself and have got a mouth of your own to bid discreetly with was ever such an absurdity he began to get angry do you want to quarrel with me uncle philip said christopher firing up because sneering at my rosa is the way and the only way and the sure way oh no said rosa interposing uncle philip was right i am very foolish and inexperienced but i am not so vain as to turn from good advice i will never employ a broker again sir uncle philip smiled and looked pleased mrs cole caused a diversion by taking leave and rosa followed her downstairs on her return she found christopher telling his uncle all about the bijou and how he had taken it for a hundred and thirty pounds a year and a hundred pounds premium and uncle philip staring fearfully at last he found his tongue the bijou said he why that is a name they gave to a little den in dear street mayfair you havent ever been and taken that built over a mews christopher groaned that is the place i fear why the owner is a friend of mine an old patient stables stunk him out let it to a man i forget his name stables stunk him out he said i shall go you cant said my friend you have taken a lease lease be dd said the other i never took your house heres quite a large stench not specified in your description of the propertyit cant be the same place flung the lease at his head and cut like the wind to foreign parts less odoriferous id have got you the hole for ninety but you are like your wifeyou must go to an agent what dont you know that an agent is a man acting for you with an interest opposed to yours employing an agent it is like a trojan seeking the aid of a greek you neednt cry mrs staines your husband has been let in deeper than you have now you are young people beginning life ill give you a piece of advice employ others to do what you cant do and it must be done but never to do anything you can do better for yourselves agent the word is derived from a latin word agere to do and agents act up to their etymology for they invariably do the nincompoop that employs them or deals with them in any mortal way id have got you that beastly little bijou for ninety pounds a year uncle philip went away crusty leaving the young couple finely mortified and discouraged that did not last very long christopher noted the experience and uncle phils wisdom in his diary and then took his wife on his knee and comforted her and said never mind experience is worth money and it always has to be bought those who cheat us will die poorer than we shall if we are honest and economical i have observed that people are seldom ruined by the vices of others these may hurt them of course but it is only their own faults and follies that can destroy them ah christie said rosa you are a man oh the comfort of being married to a man a man sees the best side i do adore men dearest i will waste no more of your money i will go to no more sales christopher saw she was deeply mortified and he said quietly on the contrary you will go to the very next only take uncle philips advice employ no broker and watch the prices things fetch when you are not bidding and keep cool she caressed his ears with both her white hands and thanked him for giving her another trial so that trouble melted in the sunshine of conjugal love notwithstanding the agents solemn assurance the bijou was out of repair dr staines detected internal odors as well as those that flowed in from the mews he was not the man to let his wife perish by miasma so he had the drains all up and actually found brick drains and a cesspool he stopped that up and laid down new pipe drains with a good fall and properly trapped the old drains were hidden after the manner of builders he had the whole course of his new drains marked upon all the floors they passed under and had several stones and boards hinged to facilitate examination at any period but all this with the necessary cleaning whitewashing painting and papering ran away with money then came rosas purchases which to her amazement amounted to one hundred and ninety pounds and not a carpet curtain or bed amongst the lot then there was the carriage home from the auctionroom an expense one avoids by buying at a shop and the broker claimed his shilling in the pound this however staines refused the man came and blustered rosa who was there trembled then for the first time she saw her husbands brow lower he seemed transfigured and looked terrible you scoundrel said he you set another villain like yourself to bid against you and you betrayed the innocent lady that employed you i could indict you and your confederate for a conspiracy i take the goods out of respect for my wifes credit but you shall gain nothing by swindling her be off you heartless miscreant or ill ill take the law if you do take it then ill give you something to howl for and he seized him with a grasp so tremendous that the fellow cried out in dismay oh dont hit me sir pray dont on this abject appeal staines tore the door open with his left hand and spun the broker out into the passage with his right two movements of this angry hercules and the man was literally whirled out of sight with a rapidity and swiftness almost ludicrous it was like a trick in a pantomime a clatter on the stairs betrayed that he had gone down the first few steps in a wholesale and irregular manner though he had just managed to keep his feet as for staines he stood there still lowering like thunder and his eyes like hot coals but his wife threw her tender arms around him and begged him consolingly not to mind she was trembling like an aspen dear me said christopher with a ludicrous change to marked politeness and respect i forgot you in my righteous indignation next he became uxorious did they frighten her a duck sit on my knee darling and pull my hair for not being more consideratethere there this was followed by the whole absurd soothing process as practised by manly husbands upon quivering and somewhat hysterical wives and ended with a formal apology you must not think that i am passionate on the contrary i am always practising selfgovernment my maxim is animum rege qui nisi paret imperat and that means make your temper your servant or else it will be your master but to illuse my dear little wifeit is unnatural it is monstrous it makes my blood boil oh dear dont go into another it is all over i cant bear to see you in a passion you are so terrible so beautiful ah they are fine things courage and strength theres nothing i admire so much why they are as common as dirt what i admire is modesty timidity sweetness the sensitive cheek that pales or blushes at a word the bosom that quivers and clings to a fellow whenever anything goes wrong oh that is what you admire is it said rosa dryly admire it said christopher not seeing the trap i adore it then christie dear you are a simpleton that is all and we are made for one another the house was to be furnished and occupied as soon as possible so mrs staines and mrs cole went to another saleroom mrs staines remembered all uncle philip had said and went plainly dressed but her friend declined to sacrifice her showy dress to her friends interests rosa thought that a little unkind but said nothing in this auctionroom they easily got a place at the table but did not find it heaven for a number of secondhand carpets were in the sale and these brimful of dust were all shown on the table and the dirt choked and poisoned our fair friends brokers pestered them until at last rosa smarting under her late exposure addressed the auctioneer quietly in her silvery tones sir these gentlemen are annoying me by forcing their services on me i do not intend to buy at all unless i can be allowed to bid for myself when rosa blushing and amazed at her own boldness uttered these words she little foresaw their effect she had touched a popular sore you are quite right madam said a respectable tradesman opposite her what business have these dirty fellows without a shilling in their pockets to go and force themselves on a lady against her will it has been complained of in the papers again and again said another what maynt we live as well as you retorted a broker yes but not to force yourself on a lady why shed give you in charge of the police if you tried it on outside then there was a downright clamor of discussion and chaff presently up rises very slowly a countryman so colossal that it seemed as if he would never have done getting up and gives his experiences he informed the company in a broad yorkshire dialect that he did a bit in furniture and at first starting these brokers buzzed about him like flies and pestered him aah damned em pretty hard said he but they didnt heed any so then ah spoke em civil and ah said well lads i dinna come fra yorkshire to sit like a dummy and let you buy wi my brass the first that pesters me again ahll just fell him on t plaace like a caulf and ahm not very sure hell get up again in a hurry so they dropped me like a hot potato never pestered me again but if they wont give over pestering you mistress ahll come round and just stand behind your chair and bring nieve with me showing a fist like a leg of mutton no no said the auctioneer that will not do i will have no disturbance here call the policeman while the clerk went to the door for the bobby a gentleman reminded the auctioneer that the journals had repeatedly drawn attention to the nuisance fault of the public not mine sir policeman stand behind that ladys chair and if anybody annoys her put him quietly into the street this auctionroom will be to let soon said a voice at the end of the table this auctionroom said the auctioneer master of the gay or grave at a moments notice is supported by the public and the trade it is not supported by paupers a jew upholsterer put in his word i do my own business but i like to let a poor man live jonathan said the auctioneer to one of his servants after this sale you may put up the shutters we have gone and offended mr jacobs he keeps a shop in blind alley whitechapel now then lot rosa bid timidly for one or two lots and bought them cheap the auctioneer kept looking her way and she had only to nod the obnoxious broker got opposite her and ran her up a little out of spite but as he had only got half a crown about him and no means of doubling it he dared not go far on the other side of the table was a figure to which rosas eyes often turned with interesta fair young boy about twelve years old he had golden hair and was in deep mourning his appearance interested rosa and she wondered how he came there and why he looked like a lamb wedged in among wolves a flower among weeds as the lots proceeded the boy seemed to get uneasy and at last when lot was put up anybody could see in his poor little face that he was there to bid for it lot an armchair covered in morocco an excellent and useful article should not be at all surprised if it was made by gillow gillow would though said jacobs who owed him a turn chorus of dealershaw haw the auctioneeri like to hear some people run a lot down shows they are going to bid for it in earnest well name your own price five pounds to begin now if nobody had spoken the auctioneer would have gone on well four pounds thenthree two whatever you like and at last obtained a bona fide offer of thirty shillings but the moment he said five pounds to begin the boy in black lifted up his childish treble and bid thus five pound tensix poundssix pound tenseven poundsseven pound teneight poundseight pound tennine poundsnine pound tenten pounds without interruption and indeed almost in a breath there was a momentary pause of amazement and then an outburst of chaff nice little boy didnt he say his lesson well favor us with your card sir you are a gent as knows how to buy what did he stop for if its worth ten it is worth a hundred bless the child said a female dealer kindly what made you go on like that why there was no one bid against you youd have got it for two poundsa rickety old thing young master began to whimper why the gentleman said five pounds to begin it was the chair poor grandpapa always sat in and all the things are sold and mamma said it would break her heart to lose it she was too ill to come so she sent me she told me i was not to let it be sold away from us for less than ten pounds or she shshould be mmmiserable and the poor little fellow began to cry rosa followed suit promptly but unobtrusively sentiment always costs money said mr jacobs gravely how do you know asked mr cohen have you got any on hand i never seen none at your shop some tempting things now came up and mrs staines bid freely but all of a sudden she looked down the table and there was uncle philip twinkling as before oh dear what am i doing now thought she i have got no broker she bid on but in fear and trembling because of those twinkling eyes at last she mustered courage wrote on a leaf of her pocketbook and passed it down to him it would be only kind to warn me what am i doing wrong he sent her back a line directly auctioneer running you up himself follow his eye when he bids you will see there is no bona fide bidder at your prices rosa did so and found that it was true she nodded to uncle philip and with her expressive face asked him what she should do the old boy must have his joke so he wrote back tell him as you see he has a fancy for certain articles you would not be so discourteous as to bid against him the next article but one was a drawingroom suite rosa wanted but the auctioneer bid against her so at eighteen pounds she stopped it is against you madam said the auctioneer yes sir said rosa but as you are the only bidder and you have been so kind to me i would not think of opposing you the words were scarcely out of her mouth when they were greeted with a roar of homeric laughter that literally shook the room and this time not at the expense of the innocent speaker thats into your mutton governor sharps the word this time i say governor dont you want a broker to bid for ye wink at me next time sir ill do the office for you no greenhorns left now that lady wont give a tenpund note for her grandfathers armchair oh yes she will if its stuffed with banknotes put the next lot up with the owners name and the reserve price open business and sing a psalm at starting a little less noise in judaea if you please said the auctioneer who had now recovered from the blow lot this was a very pretty marqueterie cabinet it stood against the wall and rosa had set her heart upon it nobody would bid she had muzzled the auctioneer effectually your own price two pounds said rosa a dealer offered guineas and it advanced slowly to four pounds and half a crown at which it was about to be knocked down to rosa when suddenly a new bidder arose in the broker rosa had rejected they bid slowly and sturdily against each other until a line was given to rosa from uncle philip this time it is your own friend the snipenosed woman she telegraphed a broker rosa read and crushed the note six guineas said she sixten seven seventen eight eightten ten guineas said rosa and then with feminine cunning stealing a sudden glance caught her friend leaning back and signalling the broker not to give in eleven pounds twelve thirteen fourteen sixteen eighteen twenty twenty guineas it is yours my faithful friend said rosa turning suddenly round to mrs cole with a magnificent glance no one would have thought her capable of then she rose and stalked away dumfounded for the moment mrs cole followed her and stopped her at the door why rosie dear it is the only thing i have bid for there ive sat by your side like a mouse rosa turned gravely towards her you know it is not that you had only to tell me you wanted it i would never have been so mean as to bid against you mean indeed said florence tossing her head yes mean to draw back and hide behind the friend you were with and employ the very rogue she had turned off but it is my own fault cecilia warned me against you she always said you were a treacherous girl and i say you are an impudent little minx only just married and going about like two vagabonds and talk to me like that we are not going about like two vagabonds we have taken a house in mayfair say a stable it was by your advice you falsehearted creature you are a fool you are worse you are a traitress then dont you have anything to do with me heaven forbid i should you treacherous thing you insolentinsolenti hate you and i despise you i always hated you at bottom thats why you pretended to love me you wretch well i pretend no more i am your enemy for life thank you you have told the truth for once in your life i have and he shall never call in your husband so you may leave mayfair as soon as you like not to please you madam we can get on without traitors and so they parted with eyes that gleamed like tigers rosa drove home in great agitation and tried to tell christopher but choked and became hysterical the husbandphysician coaxed and scolded her out of that and presently in came uncle philip full of the humors of the auctionroom he told about the little boy with a delight that disgusted mrs staines and then was particularly merry on female friendships fancy a man going to a sale with his friend and bidding against him on the sly she is no friend of mine we are enemies for life and you were to be friends till death said staines with a sigh philip inquired who she was mrs john cole not of curzon street yes and you have quarrelled with her yes well but her husband is a general practitioner she is a traitress but her husband could put a good deal of money in christophers way i cant help it she is a traitress and you have quarrelled with her about an old wardrobe no for her disloyalty and her base goodfornothingness oh oh oh uncle philip got up looking sour good afternoon mrs christopher said he very dryly christopher accompanied him to the foot of the stairs well christopher said he matrimony is a blunder at the best and you have not done the thing by halves you have married a simpleton she will be your ruin uncle philip since you only come here to insult us i hope in future you will stay at home oh with pleasure sir goodby chapter vii christopher staines came back looking pained and disturbed there said he i feared it would come to this i have quarrelled with uncle philip oh how could you he affronted me what about never you mind dont let us say anything more about it darling it is a pity a sad pityhe was a good friend of mine once he paused entered what had passed in his diary and then sat down with a gentle expression of sadness on his manly features rosa hung about him soft and pitying till it cleared away at all events for the time next day they went together to clear the goods rosa had purchased whilst the list was being made out in the office in came the fairhaired boy with a tenpound note in his very hand rosa caught sight of it and turned to the auctioneer with a sweet pitying face oh sir surely you will not take all that money from him poor child for a rickety old chair the auctioneer stared with amazement at her simplicity and said what would the vendors say to me she looked distressed and said well then really we ought to raise a subscription poor thing why maam said the auctioneer he isnt hurt the article belonged to his mother and her sister the brotherinlaw isnt on good terms so he demanded a public sale she will get back four pun ten out of it here the clerk put in his word and theres five pounds paid i forgot to tell you oh left a deposit did he no sir but the laughing hyena gave you five pounds at the end of the sale the laughing hyena mr jones oh beg pardon that is what we call him in the room he has got such a curious laugh oh i know the gent he is a retired doctor i wish hed laugh less and buy more and he gave you five pounds towards the young gentlemans armchair well i should as soon have expected blood from a flint you have got five pounds to pay sir so now the chair will cost your mamma ten shillings give him the order and the change mr jones christopher and rosa talked this over in the room whilst the men were looking out their purchases come said rosa now i forgive him sneering at me his heart is not really hard you see staines on the contrary was very angry what he cried pity a boy who made one bad bargain that after all was not a very bad bargain and he had no kindness nor even common humanity for my beautiful rosa inexperienced as a child and buying for her husband like a good affectionate honest creature amongst a lot of sharpers and hardhearted cynicslike himself it was cruel of him said rosa altering her mind in a moment and half inclined to cry this made christopher furious the illnatured crotchety oldthe fact is he is a misogynist oh the wretch said rosa warmly and what is that a womanhater oh is that all why so do iafter that florence cole women are mean heartless things give me men they are loyal and true all of them inquired christopher a little satirically read the papers every soul of them said mrs staines passing loftily over the proposed test that is all the ones i care about and that is my own own one disagreeable creatures to have about onethese simpletons mrs staines took christopher to shops to buy the remaining requisites and in three days more the house was furnished two female servants engaged and the couple took their luggage over to the bijou rosa was excited and happy at the novelty of possession and authority and that close sense of house proprietorship which belongs to woman by dinnertime she could have told you how many shelves there were in every cupboard and knew the bijou by heart in a way that christopher never knew it all this ended as running about and excitement generally does with my lady being exhausted and lax with fatigue so then he made her lie down on a little couch while he went through his accounts when he had examined all the bills carefully he looked very grave and said who would believe this we began with three thousand pounds it was to last us several yearstill i got a good practice rosa there is only fourteen hundred and forty pounds left oh impossible said rosa oh dear why did i ever enter a saleroom no no my darling you were bitten once or twice but you made some good bargains too remember there was four hundred pounds set apart for my life policy what a waste of money your father did not think so then the lease the premium repairs of the drains that would have poisoned my rosa turning the coachhouse into a dispensary painting papering and furnishing china and linen and everything to buy we must look at this seriously only fourteen hundred and forty pounds left a slow profession no friends i have quarrelled with uncle philip you with mrs cole and her husband would have launched me and it was to please her we settled here oh i could kill her nasty cat never mind it is not a case for despondency but it is for prudence all we have to do is to look the thing in the face and be very economical in everything i had better give you an allowance for housekeeping and i earnestly beg you to buy things yourself whilst you are a poor mans wife and pay ready money for everything my mother was a great manager and she always said there is but one way be your own marketwoman and pay on the spot never let the tradesmen get you on their books or what with false weight double charges and the things your servants order that never enter the house you lose more than a hundred a year by cheating rosa yielded a languid assent to this part of his discourse and it hardly seemed to enter her mind but she raised no objection and in due course he made her a special allowance for housekeeping it soon transpired that medical advice was to be had gratis at the bijou from eight till ten and there was generally a good attendance but a week passed and not one patient came of the class this couple must live by christopher set this down to what people call the transition period his kent patients had lost him his london patients not found him he wrote to all his patients in the country and many of his pupils at the university to let them know where he was settled and then he waited not a creature came rosa bore this very well for a time so long as the house was a novelty but when that excitement was worn out she began to be very dull and used to come and entice him out to walk with her he would look wistfully at her but object that if he left the house he should be sure to lose a patient oh they wont come any more for our staying intiresome things said rosa but christopher would kiss her and remain firm my love said he you do not realize how hard a fight there is before us how should you you are very young no for your sake i must not throw a chance away write to your female friends that will while away an hour or two what after that florence cole write to those who have not made such violent professions so i will dear especially to those that are married and come to london oh and ill write to that coldblooded thing lady cicely treherne why do you shake your head did i i was not aware well dear if ladies of rank were to come here i fear they might make you discontented with your lot all the women on earth could not do that however the chances are she will not come near me she left the school quite a big girl an immense girl when i was only twelve she used to smile at my capriccios and once she kissed meactually she was an awful sawny though and so affected i think i will write to her these letters brought just one lady a mrs turner who talked to rosa very glibly about herself and amused rosa twice at the third visit rosa tried to change the conversation mrs turner instantly got up and went away she could not bear the sound of the human voice unless it was talking about her and her affairs and now staines began to feel downright uneasy income was going steadily out not a shilling coming in the lame the blind and the sick frequented his dispensary and got his skill out of him gratis and sometimes a little physic a little wine and other things that cost him money but of the patients that pay not one came to his front door he walked round and round his little yard like a hyena in its cage waiting waiting waiting and oh how he envied the lot of those who can hunt for work instead of having to stay at home and wait for others to come whose will they cannot influence his heart began to sicken with hope deferred and dim forebodings of the future and he saw with grief that his wife was getting duller and duller and that her days dragged more heavily far than his own for he could study at last his knocker began to show signs of life his visitors were physicians his lectures on diagnosis were well known to them and one after another found him out they were polite kind even friendly but here it ended these gentlemen of course did not resign their patients to him and the inferior class of practitioners avoided his door like a pestilence mrs staines who had always lived for amusement could strike out no fixed occupation her time hung like lead the house was small and in small houses the faults of servants run against the mistress and she cant help seeing them and all the worse for her it is easier to keep things clean in the country and rosa had a high standard which her two servants could never quite attain this annoyed her and she began to scold a little they answered civilly but in other respects remained imperfect beings they laid out every shilling they earned in finery and this i am ashamed to say irritated mrs staines who was wearing out her wedding garments and had no excuse for buying and staines had begged her to be economical the more they dressed the more she scolded they began to answer she gave the cook warning the other though not on good terms with the cook had a gush of esprit de corps directly and gave mrs staines warning mrs staines told her husband all this he took her part though without openly interfering and they had two new servants not so good as the last this worried rosa sadly but it was a fleabite to the deeper nature and more forecasting mind of her husband still doomed to pace that miserable yard like a hyena chafing seeking longing for the patient that never came rosa used to look out of his dressingroom window and see him pace the yard at first tears of pity stood in her eyes by and by she got angry with the world and at last strange to say a little irritated with him it is hard for a weak woman to keep up all her respect for the man that fails one day after watching him a long time unseen she got excited put on her shawl and bonnet and ran down to him she took him by the arm if you love me come out of this prison and walk with me we are too miserable i shall be your first patient if this goes on much longer he looked at her saw she was very excited and had better be humored so he kissed her and just said with a melancholy smile how poor are they that have not patience then he put on his hat and walked in the park and kensington gardens with her the season was just beginning there were carriages enough and gay amazons enough to make poor rosa sigh more than once christopher heard the sigh and pressed her arm and said courage love i hope to see you among them yet the sooner the better said she a little hardly and meantime which of them all is as beautiful as you all i know is they are more attractive who looks at me walking tamely by christopher said nothing but these words seemed to imply a thirst for admiration and made him a little uneasy by and by the walk put the swiftchanging rosa in spirits and she began to chat gayly and hung prattling and beaming on her husbands arm when they entered curzon street here however occurred an incident trifling in itself but unpleasant dr staines saw one of his best kentish patients get feebly out of his carriage and call on dr barr he started and stopped rosa asked what was the matter he told her she said we are unfortunate staines said nothing he only quickened his pace but he was greatly disturbed she expected him to complain that she had dragged him out and lost him that first chance but he said nothing when they got home he asked the servant had anybody called no sir surely you are mistaken jane a gentleman in a carriage not a creature have been since you went out sir well then dearest said he sweetly we have nothing to reproach ourselves with then he knit his brow gloomily it is worse than i thought it seems even ones country patients go to another doctor when they visit london it is hard it is hard rosa leaned her head on his shoulder and curled round him as one she would shield against the worlds injustice but she said nothing she was a little frightened at his eye that lowered and his noble frame that trembled a little with ire suppressed two days after this a brougham drove up to the door and a tallish fattish pastyfaced man got out and inquired for dr staines he was shown into the diningroom and told jane he had come to consult the doctor rosa had peeped over the stairs all curiosity she glided noiselessly down and with loves swift foot got into the yard before jane he is come he is come kiss me dr staines kissed her first and then asked who was come oh nobody of any consequence only the first patient kiss me again dr staines kissed her again and then was for going to the first patient no said she not yet i met a doctors wife at dr maynes and she told me things you must always keep them waiting or else they think nothing of you such a funny woman treat em like dogs my dear she said but i told her they wouldnt come to be treated like dogs or any other animal you had better have kept that to yourself i think oh if you are going to be disagreeable goodby you can go to your patient sir christie dear if he is veryvery illand im sure i hope he isoh how wicked i am may i have a new bonnet if you really want one on the patients card was mr pettigrew manchester square as soon as staines entered the room the first patient told him who and what he was a retired civilian from india but he had got a son there still a very rising man wanted to be a parson but he would not stand that bad profession dont rise by merit very hard to rise at allno india was the place as for me i made my fortune there in ten years obliged to leave it nowinvalid this many years no tone tried two or three doctors in this neighborhood heard there was a new one had written a book on something thought i would try him to stop him staines requested to feel his pulse and examine his tongue and eye you are suffering from indigestion said he i will write you a prescription but if you want to get well you must simplify your diet very much while he was writing the prescription off went this patients tongue and ran through the topics of the day and into his family history again staines listened politely he could afford it having only this one at last the first patient having delivered an octavo volume of nothing rose to go but it seems that speaking an infinite deal of nothing exhausts the body though it does not affect the mind for the first patient sank down in his chair again i have excited myself too muchfeel rather faint staines saw no signs of coming syncope he rang the bell quietly and ordered a decanter of sherry to be brought the first patient filled himself a glass then another and went off revived to chatter elsewhere but at the door he said i had always a running account with dr mivar i suppose you dont object to that system double fee the first visit single afterwards dr staines bowed a little stiffly he would have preferred the money however he looked at the blue book and found his visitor lived at manchester square so that removed his anxiety the first patient called every other day chattered nineteen to the dozen was exhausted drank two glasses of sherry and drove away soon after this a second patient called this one was a deputy patientcollett a retired butlerkept a lodginghouse and waited at parties he lived close by but had a married daughter in chelsea would the doctor visit her and he would be responsible staines paid the woman a visit or two and treated her so effectually that soon her visits were paid to him she was cured and staines who by this time wanted to see money sent to collett collett did not answer staines wrote warmly collett dead silent staines employed a solicitor collett said he had recommended the patient that was all he had never said he would pay her debts that was her husbands business now her husband was the mate of a ship would not be in england for eighteen months the woman visited by lawyers clerk cried bitterly and said she and her children had scarcely enough to eat lawyer advised staines to abandon the case and pay him two pounds fifteen shillings expenses he did so this is damnable said he i must get it out of pettigrew bytheby he has not been here this two days he waited another day for pettigrew and then wrote to him no answer called pettigrew gone abroad house in manchester square to let staines went to the houseagent with his tale agent was impenetrable at first but at last won by the doctors manner and his unhappiness referred him to pettigrews solicitor the solicitor was a respectable man and said he would forward the claim to pettigrew in paris but by this time pettigrew was chattering and guzzling in berlin and thence he got to st petersburg in that stronghold of gluttony he gormandized more than ever and being unable to talk it off his stomach as in other cities had apoplexy and died but long before this staines saw his money was as irrecoverable as his sherry and he said to rosa i wonder whether i shall ever live to curse the human race heaven forbid said rosa oh they use you cruelly my poor poor christie thus for months the young doctors patients bled him and that was all and rosa got more and more moped at being in the house so much and pestered christopher to take her out and he declined and being a man hard to beat took to writing on medical subjects in hopes of getting some money from the various medical and scientific publications but he found it as hard to get the wedge in there as to get patients at last rosas remonstrances began to rise into something that sounded like reproaches one sunday she came to him in her bonnet and interrupted his studies to say he might as well lay down the pen and talk nobody would publish anything he wrote christopher frowned but contained himself and laid down the pen i might as well not be married at all as be a doctors wife you are never seen out with me not even to church do behave like a christian and come to church with me now dr staines shook his head why i wouldnt miss church for all the world any excitement is better than always moping come over the water with me the time jane and i went the clergyman read a paper that mr brown had fallen down in a fit there was such a rush directly and im sure fifty ladies went outfancy all mrs browns wasnt that fun fun i dont see it well rosa your mind is evidently better adapted to diversion than mine is go you to church love and ill continue my studies then all i can say is i wish i was back in my fathers house husband friend companioni have none then she burst out crying violently and being shocked at what she had said and at the agony it had brought into her husbands face she went off into hysterics and as his heart would not let him bellow at her or empty a bucket on her as he would on another patient she had a good long bout of them and got her way for she broke up his studies for that day at all events even after the hysterics were got under she continued to moan and sigh very prettily with her lovely languid head pillowed on her husbands arm in a word though the hysterics were real yet this innocent young person had the presence of mind to postpone entire convalescence and lay herself out to be petted all day but fate willed it otherwise while she was sighing and moaning came to the door a scurrying of feet and then a sharp persistent ringing that meant something the moaner cocked eye and ear and said in her everyday voice which coming so suddenly sounded very droll what is that i wonder jane hurried to the streetdoor and rosa recovered by magic and preferring gossip to hysterics in an almost gleeful whisper ordered christopher to open the door of the study the bijou was so small that the following dialogue rang in their ears a boy in buttons gasped out oh if you please will you ast the doctor to come round directly theres a haccident la bless me said jane and never budged yes miss its our missuss little girl fallen right off an ichair and cut her head dreadful and smothered in blood la to be sure and she waited steadily for more ay and missus she fainted right off and ive been to the regler doctor which hes out and sarah the housemaid said i had better come here you was only just set up she said you wouldnt have so much to do says she that is all she knows said jane why our masterthey pulls him in pieces which is to have him fust what an awful liar oh you good girl whispered dr staines and rosa in one breath ah well said buttons any way sarah says she knows you are clever cos her little girl as lives with her mother and calls sarah aunt has bin to your spensary with ringworm and you cured her right off ay and a good many more said jane loftily she was a housemaid of imagination and while staines was putting some lint and an instrument case into his pocket she proceeded to relate a number of miraculous cures dr staines interrupted them by suddenly emerging and inviting buttons to take him to the house mrs staines was so pleased with jane for cracking up the doctor that she gave her five shillings and after that used to talk to her a great deal more than to the cook which judicious conduct presently set all three by the ears buttons took the doctor to a fine house in the same street and told him his mistresss name on the waymrs lucas he was taken up to the nursery and found mrs lucas seated crying and lamenting and a woman holding a little girl of about seven whose brow had been cut open by the fender on which she had fallen from a chair it looked very ugly and was even now bleeding dr staines lost no time he examined the wound keenly and then said kindly to mrs lucas i am happy to tell you it is not serious he then asked for a large basin and some tepid water and bathed it so softly and soothingly that the child soon became composed and the mother discovered the artist at once he compressed the wound and explained to mrs lucas that the principal thing really was to avoid an ugly scar there is no danger said he he then bound the wound neatly up and had the girl put to bed you will not wake her at any particular hour nurse let her sleep have a little strong beeftea ready and give it her at any hour night or day she asks for it but do not force it on her or you will do her more harm than good she had better sleep before she eats mrs lucas begged him to come every morning and as he was going she shook hands with him and the soft palm deposited a hard substance wrapped in paper he took it with professional gravity and seeming unconsciousness but once outside the house went home on wings he ran up to the drawingroom and found his wife seated and playing at reading he threw himself on his knees and the fee into her lap and while she unfolded the paper with an ejaculation of pleasure he said darling the first real patientthe first real fee it is yours to buy the new bonnet oh im so glad said she with her eyes glistening but im afraid one cant get a bonnet fit to wearfor a guinea dr staines visited his little patient every day and received his guinea mrs lucas also called him in for her own little ailments and they were the best possible kind of ailments for being imaginary there was no limit to them then did mrs staines turn jealous of her husband they never ask me said she and i am moped to death it is hard said christopher sadly but have a little patience society will come to you long before practice comes to me about two oclock one afternoon a carriage and pair drove up and a gorgeous footman delivered a cardlady cicely treherne of course mrs staines was at home and only withheld by propriety from bounding into the passage to meet her schoolfellow however she composed herself in the drawingroom and presently the door was opened and a very tall young woman richly but not gayly dressed drifted into the room and stood there a statue of composure rosa had risen to fly to her but the reverence a girl of eighteen strikes into a child of twelve hung about her still and she came timidly forward blushing and sparkling a curious contrast in color and mind to her visitor for lady cicely was languor in personher hair whiteybrown her face a fine oval but almost colorless her eyes a pale gray her neck and hands incomparably white and beautifula lymphatic young lady a live antidote to emotion however rosas beauty timidity and undisguised affectionateness were something so different from what she was used to in the world of fashion that she actually smiled and held out both her hands a little way rosa seized them and pressed them they left her and remained passive and limp o lady cicely said rosa how kind of you to come how kind of you to send to me was the polite but perfectly cool reply but how you are gwown andmay i say impwovedyou la petite lusignan it is incwedible lisped her ladyship very calmly i was only a child said rosa you were always so beautiful and tall and kind to a little monkey like me oh pray sit down lady cicely and talk of old times she drew her gently to the sofa and they sat down hand in hand but lady cicelys highbred reserve made her a very poor gossip about anything that touched herself and her family so rosa though no egotist was drawn into talking about herself more than she would have done had she deliberately planned the conversation but here was an old schoolfellow and a singularly polite listener and so out came her love her genuine happiness her particular griefs and especially the crowning grievance no society moped to death etc lady cicely could hardly understand the sentiment in a woman who so evidently loved her husband society said she after due reflection why it is a boa and here i may as well explain that lady cicely spoke certain words falsely and others affectedly and as for the letter r she could say it if she made a hearty effort but was generally too lazy to throw her leg over it society im dwenched to death with it if i could only catch fiah like other women and love somebody i would much rather have a teteatete with him than go teawing about all day and all night from one unintwisting cwowd to another to be sure said she puzzling the matter out you are a beauty and would be more looked at the idea andoh no no it is not that but even in the country we had always some society well dyar believe me with your appeawance you can have as much society as you please but it will boa you to death as it does me and then you will long to be left quiet with a sensible man who loves you said rosa when shall i have another teteatete with you i wonder oh it has been such a comfort to me bless you for coming therei wrote to cecilia and emily and mrs bosanquet that is now and all my sworn friends and to think of you being the one to comeyou that never kissed me but once and an earls daughter into the bargain ha ha halady cicely actually laughed for once in a way and did not feel the effort as for kissing said she if i fall shawt fawgive me i was nevaa vewy demonstwative no and i have had a lesson that florence coleflorence whiting that was you knowwas always kissing me and she has turned out a traitor ill tell you all about her and she did lady cicely thought mrs staines a little too unreserved in her conversation but was so charmed with her sweetness and freshness that she kept up the acquaintance and called on her twice a week during the season at first she wondered that her visits were not returned but rosa let out that she was ashamed to call on foot in grosvenor square lady cicely shrugged her beautiful shoulders a little at that but she continued to do the visiting and to enjoy the simple innocent rapture with which she was received this ladys pronunciation of many words was false or affected she said good murning for good morning and turned other vowels to diphthongs and played two or three pranks with her rs but we cannot be all imperfection with her pronunciation her folly came to a full stop i really believe she lisped less nonsense and bad taste in a year than some of us articulate in a day to be sure folly is generally uttered in a hurry and she was too deplorably lazy to speak fast on any occasion whatever one day mrs staines took her upstairs and showed her from the back window her husband pacing the yard waiting for patients lady cicely folded her arms and contemplated him at first with a sort of zoological curiosity gentleman pacing back yard like hyena she had never seen before at last she opened her mouth in a whisper what is he doing waiting for patients oh waitingforpatients for patients that never come and never will come cuwious how little i know of life it is that all day dear or else writing lady cicely with her eyes fixed on staines made a motion with her hand that she was attending and they wont publish a word he writes poor man nice for me is it not i begin to understand said lady cicely quietly and soon after retired with her invariable composure meantime dr staines like a good husband had thrown out occasional hints to mrs lucas that he had a wife beautiful accomplished moped more than that he went so far as to regret to her that mrs staines being in a neighborhood new to him saw so little society the more so as she was formed to shine and had not been used to seclusion all these hints fell dead on mrs lucas a handsome and skilful doctor was welcome to her his wifethat was quite another matter but one day mrs lucas saw lady cicely trehernes carriage standing at the door the style of the whole turnout impressed her she wondered whose it was on another occasion she saw it drive up and the lady get out she recognized her and the very next day this parvenue said adroitly now dr staines really you cant be allowed to hide your wife in this way staines stared why not introduce her to me next wednesday it is my night i would give a dinner expressly for her but i dont like to do that while my husband is in naples when staines carried the invitation to his wife she was delighted and kissed him with childish frankness but the very next moment she became thoughtful uneasy depressed oh dear ive nothing to wear oh nonsense rosa your wedding outfit the idea i cant go as a bride its not a masquerade but you have other dresses all gone by more or less or not fit for such parties as she gives a hundred carriages bring them down and let me see them oh yes and the lady who had nothing to wear paraded a very fair show of dresses staines saw something to admire in all of them mrs staines found more to object to in each at last he fell upon a silvergray silk of superlative quality that it is as old as the hills shrieked rosa it looks just out of the shop come tell the truth how often have you worn it i wore it before i was married ay but how often twice three times i believe i thought so it is good as new but i have had it so long by me i had it two years before i made it up what does that matter do you think the people can tell how long a dress has been lurking in your wardrobe this is childish rosa there with this dress as good as new and your beauty you will be as much admired and perhaps hated as your heart can desire i am afraid not said rosa naively oh how i wish i had known a week ago i am very thankful you did not said staines dryly at ten oclock mrs staines was nearly dressed at a quarter past ten she demanded ten minutes at halfpast ten she sought a reprieve at a quarter to eleven being assured that the street was full of carriages which had put down at mrs lucass she consented to emerge and in a minute they were at the house they were shown first into a cloakroom and then into a tearoom and then mounted the stairs one servant took their names and bawled them to another four yards off he to another about as near and so on and they edged themselves into the room not yet too crowded to move in they had not taken many steps on the chance of finding their hostess when a slight buzz arose and seemed to follow them rosa wondered what that was but only for a moment she observed a tall stout aquiline woman fix an eye of bitter diabolical malignant hatred on her and as she advanced ugly noses were cocked disdainfully and scraggy shoulders elevated at the risk of sending the bones through the leather and a titter or two shot after her a womans instinct gave her the key at once the sexes had complimented her at sight each in their way the men with respectful admiration the women with their inflammable jealousy and ready hatred in another of the quality they value most in themselves but the country girl was too many for them she would neither see nor bear but moved sedately on and calmly crushed them with her southern beauty their dry powdered faces could not live by the side of her glowing skin with natures delicate gloss upon it and the rich blood mantling below it the gotup beauties ie the majority seemed literally to fade and wither as she passed mrs lucas got to her suppressed a slight maternal pang having daughters to marry and took her line in a moment here was a decoy duck mrs lucas was all graciousness made acquaintance and took a little turn with her introducing her to one or two persons among the rest to the malignant woman mrs barr mrs barr on this ceased to look daggers and substituted icicles but on the hateful beauty moving away dropped the icicles and resumed the poniards the rooms filled the heat became oppressive and the mixed odors of flowers scents and perspiring humanity sickening some unable to bear it trickled out of the room and sat all down the stairs rosa began to feel faint up came a tall sprightly girl whose pertness was redeemed by a certain bonhomie and said mrs staines i believe i am to make myself agreeable to you that is the order from headquarters miss lucas said staines she jerked a little offhand bow to him and said will you trust her to me for five minutes certainly but he did not much like it miss lucas carried her off and told dr staines over her shoulder now he could flirt to his hearts content thank you said he dryly ill await your return oh there are some much greater flirts here than i am said the ready miss lucas and whispering something in mrs stainess ear suddenly glided with her behind a curtain pressed a sort of button fixed to a lookingglass door the door opened and behold they were in a delicious place for which i can hardly find a word since it was a boudoir and a conservatory in one a large octagon the walls lined from floor to ceiling with lookingglasses of moderate width at intervals and with creepers that covered the intervening spaces of the wall and were trained so as to break the outline of the glasses without greatly clouding the reflection ferns in great variety were grouped in a deep crescent and in the bight of this green bay were a small table and chairs as there were no hothouse plants the temperature was very cool compared with the reeking oven they had escaped and a little fountain bubbled and fed a little meandering gutter that trickled away among the ferns it ran crystal clear over little bright pebbles and shells it did not always run you understand but miss lucas turned a secret tap and started it oh how heavenly said rosa with a sigh of relief and how good of you to bring me here yes by rights i ought to have waited till you fainted but there is no making acquaintance among all those people mamma will ask such crowds one is like a fly in a gluepot miss lucas had good nature smartness and animal spirits hence arose a vivacity and fluency that were often amusing and passed for very clever reserve she had none would talk about strangers or friends herself her mother her god and the last buffoonsinger in a breath at a hint from rosa she told her who the lady in the pink dress was and the lady in the violet velvet and so on for each lady was defined by her dress and more or less quizzed by this showwoman not exactly out of malice but because it is smarter and more natural to decry than to praise and a little medisance is the spice to gossip belongs to it as mint sauce to lamb so they chatted away and were pleased with each other and made friends and there in cool grot quite forgot the sufferings of their fellowcreatures in the adjacent turkish bath yclept society it was rosa who first recollected herself will not mrs lucas be angry with me if i keep you all to myself oh no but im afraid we must go into the hothouse again i like the greenhouse best with such a nice companion they slipped noiselessly into the throng again and wriggled about miss lucas presenting her new friend to several ladies and gentlemen presently staines found them and then miss lucas wriggled away and in due course the room was thinned by many guests driving off home or to balls and other receptions and dr staines and mrs staines went home to the bijou here the physician prescribed bed but the lady would not hear of such a thing until she had talked it all over so they compared notes and rosa told him how well she had got on with miss lucas and made a friendship but for that said she i should be sorry i went among those people such a dowdy dowdy said staines why you stormed the town you were the great success of the night and for all i know of the season the wretch delivered this with unbecoming indifference it is too bad to mock me christie where were your eyes to the best of my recollection they were one on each side of my nose yes but some people are eyes and no eyes i scorn the imputation try me very well then did you see that lady in skyblue silk embroidered with flowers and flounced with white velvet and the corsage point lace and oh such emeralds i did a tall skinny woman with eyes resembling her jewels in color though not in brightness never mind her eyes it is her dress i am speaking of exquisite and what a coiffure well did you see her in the black velvet trimmed so deep with chantilly lace wave on wave and her headdress of crimson flowers and such a riviere of diamonds oh dear oh dear i did love the room was an oven but her rubicund face and suffocating costume made it seem a furnace stuff well did you see the lady in the corncolored silk and poppies in her hair of course i did ceres in person she made me feel hot too but i cooled myself a bit at her pale sickly face never mind their faces that is not the point oh excuse me it is always a point with us benighted males all eyes and no eyes well then the lady in white with cherryvelvet bands and a white tunic looped with crimson and headdress of white illusion a la vierge i think they call it it was very refreshing and adapted to that awful atmosphere it was the nearest approach to nudity i ever saw even amongst fashionable people it was lovely and then that superb figure in white illusion and gold with all those narrow flounces over her slip of white silk glacee and a wreath of white flowers with gold wheat ears amongst them in her hair and oh oh oh her pearls oriental and as big as almonds and oh oh oh her nose reddish and as long as a woodcocks noses noses stupid that is not what strikes you first in a woman dressed like an angel well if you were to run up against that one as i nearly did her nose would be the thing that would strike you first nose it was a rostrum the spearhead of goliah now dont christopher this is no laughing matter do you mean you were not ashamed of your wife i was no i was not you had but one rival a very young lady wise before her age a blonde with violet eyes she was dressed in light mauvecolored silk without a single flounce or any other tomfoolery to fritter away the sheen and color of an exquisite material her sunny hair was another wave of color wreathed with a thin line of white jessamine flowers closely woven that scented the air this girl was the moon of that assembly and you were the sun i never even saw her eyes and no eyes she saw you and said oh what a beautiful creature for i heard her as for the old stagers whom you admire so their faces were all clogged with powder the pores stopped up the true texture of the skin abolished they looked downright nasty whenever you or that young girl passed by them then it was you saw to what a frightful extent women are got up in our day even young women and respectable women no rosa dress can do little for you you have beautyreal beauty beauty that passes unnoticed unless one is well dressed then what an obscure pair the apollo belvidere and the venus de medicis must be oh they are dressedin marble christopher staines stared first then smiled well done said he admiringly that is a knockdown blow so now you have silenced your husband go you to bed directly i cant afford you diamonds so i will take care of that little insignificant trifle your beauty mrs staines and mrs lucas exchanged calls and soon mrs staines could no longer complain she was out of the world mrs lucas invited her to every party because her beauty was an instrument of attraction she knew how to use and miss lucas took a downright fancy to her drove her in the park and on sundays to the zoological gardens just beginning to be fashionable the lucases rented a box at the opera and if it was not let at the library by six oclock and if other engagements permitted word was sent round to mrs staines as a matter of course and she was taken to the opera she began almost to live at the lucases and to be oftener fatigued than moped the usual order of things was inverted the maiden lady educated the matron for miss lucas knew all about everybody in the park honorable or dishonorable all the scandals and all the flirtations and whatever she knew she related pointblank being as inquisitive as voluble she soon learned how mrs staines and her husband were situated she took upon her to advise her in many things and especially impressed upon her that dr staines must keep a carriage if he wanted to get on in medicine the piece of advice accorded so well with rosas wishes that she urged it on her husband again and again he objected that no money was coming in and therefore it would be insane to add to their expenses rosa persisted and at last worried staines with her importunity he began to give rather short answers then she quoted miss lucas against him he treated the authority with marked contempt and then rosa fired up a little then staines held his peace but did not buy a carriage to visit his no patients so at last rosa complained to lady cicely treherne and made her the judge between her husband and herself lady cicely drawled out a prompt but polite refusal to play that part all that could be elicited from her and that with difficulty was why quall with your husband about a cawwige he is your best fwiend ah that he is said rosa but miss lucas is a good friend and she knows the world we dont neither christopher nor i so she continued to nag at her husband about it and to say that he was throwing his only chance away galled as he was by neglect this was irritating and at last he could not help telling her she was unreasonable you live a gay life and i a sad one i consent to this and let you go about with these lucases because you were so dull but you should not consult them in our private affairs their interference is indelicate and improper i will not set up a carriage till i have patients to visit i am sick of seeing our capital dwindle and no income created i will never set up a carriage till i have taken a hundredguinea fee oh then we shall go splashing through the mud all our days or ride in a cab said christopher with a quiet doggedness that left no hope of his yielding one afternoon miss lucas called for mrs staines to drive in the park but did not come upstairs it was an engagement and she knew mrs staines would be ready or nearly mrs staines not to keep her waiting came down rather hastily and in the very passage whipped out of her pocket a little glass and a little powder puff and puffed her face all over in a trice she was then going out but her husband called her into the study rosa my dear said he you were going out with a dirty face oh cried she give me a glass there is no need of that all you want is a basin and some nice rainwater i keep a little reservoir of it he then handed her the same with great politeness she looked in his eye and saw he was not to be trifled with she complied like a lamb and the heavenly color and velvet gloss that resulted were admirable he kissed her and said ah now you are my rosa again oblige me by handing over that powderpuff to me she looked vexed but complied when you come back i will tell you why you are a pest said mrs staines and so joined her friend rosy with rainwater and a rub dear me how handsome you look today was miss lucass first remark rosa never dreamed that rainwater and rub could be the cause of her looking so well it is my tiresome husband said she he objects to powder and he has taken away my puff and you stood that obliged to why you poorspirited little creature i should like to see a husband presume to interfere with me in those things here take mine rosa hesitated a little wellnoi think not miss lucas laughed at her and quizzed her so on her allowing a man to interfere in such sacred things as dress and cosmetics that she came back irritated with her husband and gave him a short answer or two then he asked what was the matter you treat me like a childtaking away my very puff i treat you like a beautiful flower that no bad gardener shall wither whilst i am here what nonsense how could that wither me it is only violet powderwhat they put on babies and who are the herods that put it on babies their own mothers that love them ten times more than the fathers do and kill a hundred of them for one a man ever kills mothersthe most wholesale homicides in the nation we will examine your violetpowder bring it down here while she was gone he sent for a breakfastcupful of flour and when she came back he had his scales out and begged her to put a teaspoonful of flour into one scale and of violet powder into another the flour kicked the beam as homer expresses himself put another spoonful of flour the one spoonful of violet powder outweighed the two of flour now said staines does not that show you the presence of a mineral in your vegetable powder i suppose they tell you it is made of white violets dried and triturated in a diamond mill let us find out what metal it is we need not go very deep into chemistry for that he then applied a simple test and detected the presence of lead in large quantities then he lectured her invisible perspiration is a process of nature necessary to health and to life the skin is made porous for that purpose you can kill anybody in an hour or two by closing the pores a certain infallible ass called pope leo xii killed a little boy in two hours by gilding him to adorn the pageant of his first procession as pope but what is death to the whole body must be injurious to a part what madness then to clog the pores of so large and important a surface as the face and check the invisible perspiration how much more to insert lead into your system every day of your life a cumulative poison and one so deadly and so subtle that the sheffield filecutters die in their prime from merely hammering on a leaden anvil and what do you gain by this suicidal habit no plum has a sweeter bloom or more delicious texture than the skin of your young face but this mineral filth hides that delicate texture and substitutes a dry uniform appearance more like a certain kind of leprosy than health nature made your face the rival of peaches roses lilies and you say no i know better than my creator and my god my face shall be like a dusty millers go into any flourmill and there you shall see men with faces exactly like your friend miss lucass but before a miller goes to his sweetheart he always washes his face you ladies would never get a miller down to your level in brains it is a millers dirty face our monomaniacs of woman imitate not the face a miller goes acourting with la what a fuss about nothing about nothing is your health nothing is your beauty nothing well then it will cost you nothing to promise me never to put powder on your face again very well i promise now what will you do for me work for youwrite for yousuffer for yoube selfdenying for youand even give myself the pain of disappointing you now and thenlooking forward to the time when i shall be able to say yes to everything you ask me ah child you little know what it costs me to say no to you rosa put her arms round him and acquiesced she was one of those who go with the last speaker but for that very reason the eternal companionship of so flighty and flirty a girl as miss lucas was injurious to her one day lady cicely treherne was sitting with mrs staines smiling languidly at her talk and occasionally drawling out a little plain good sense when in came miss lucas with her tongue well hung as usual and dashed into twenty topics in ten minutes this young lady in her discourse was like those little oily beetles you see in small ponds whose whole life is spent in tackingconfound them for itgenerally at right angles what they are in navigation was miss lucas in conversation tacked so eternally from topic to topic that no man on earth and not every woman could follow her at the sight and sound of her lady cicely congealed and stiffened easy and unpretending with mrs staines she was all dignity and even majesty in the presence of this chatterbox and the smoothness with which the transfiguration was accomplished marked that accomplished actress the highbred woman of the world rosa better able to estimate the change of manner than miss lucas was who did not know how little this sawny was afflicted with misplaced dignity looked wistfully and distressed at her lady cicely smiled kindly in reply rose without seeming to hurrycatch her condescending to be rude to charlotte lucasand took her departure with a profound and most gracious courtesy to the lady who had driven her away mrs staines saw her downstairs and said ruefully i am afraid you do not like my friend miss lucas she is a great rattle but so goodnatured and clever lady cicely shook her head clevaa people dont talk so much nonsense before strangaas oh dear said rosa i was in hopes you would like her do you like her indeed i do but i shall not if she drives an older friend away my dyah im not easily dwiven from those i esteem but you undastand that is not a woman for me to mispwonownce my ahs befawnor for you to make a bosom fwiend ofwosa staines she said this with a sudden maternal solemnity and kindness that contrasted nobly and strangely with her yeanay style and mrs staines remembered the words years after they were spoken it so happened that after this mrs staines received no more visits from lady cicely for some time and that vexed her she knew her sex enough to be aware that they are very jealous and she permitted herself to think that this highminded sawny was jealous of miss lucas this idea founded on a general estimate of her sex was dispelled by a few lines from lady cicely to say her family and herself were in deep distress her brother lord ayscough lay dying from an accident then rosa was all remorse and ran down to staines to tell him she found him with an open letter in his hand it was from dr barr and on the same subject the doctor who had always been friendly to him invited him to come down at once to hallowtree hall in huntingdonshire to a consultation there was a friendly intimation to start at once as the patient might die any moment husband and wife embraced each other in a tumult of surprised thankfulness a few necessaries were thrown into a carpetbag and dr staines was soon whirled into huntingdonshire having telegraphed beforehand he was met at the station by the earls carriage and people and driven to the hall he was received by an old silverhaired butler looking very sad who conducted him to a boudoir and then went and tapped gently at the door of the patients room it was opened and shut very softly and lady cicely dressed in black and looking paler than ever came into the room dr staines i think he bowed thank you for coming so promptly dr barr is gone i fear he thinkshe thinkso dr stainesno sign of life but in his poor hands that keep moving night and day staines looked very grave at that lady cicely observed it and faint at heart could say no more but led the way to the sickroom there in a spacious chamber lighted by a grand oriel window and two side windows lay rank title wealth and youth stricken down in a moment by a common accident the sufferers face was bloodless his eyes fixed and no signs of life but in his thumbs and they kept working with strange regularity in the room were a nurse and the surgeon the neighboring physician who had called in dr barr had just paid his visit and gone away lady cicely introduced dr staines and mr white and then dr staines stood and fixed his eyes on the patient in profound silence lady cicely scanned his countenance searchingly and was struck with the extraordinary power and intensity it assumed in examining the patient but the result was not encouraging dr staines looked grave and gloomy at last without removing his eye from the recumbent figure he said quietly to mr white thrown from his horse sir horse fell on him dr staines any visible injuries yes severe contusions and a rib broken and pressed upon the lungs i replaced and set it will you see if you please he examined and felt the patient and said it had been ably done then he was silent and searching at last he spoke again the motion of the thumbs corresponds exactly with his pulse is that so sir it is the case is without a parallel how long has he been so nearly a week impossible it is so sir lady cicely confirmed this all the better said dr staines upon reflection well sir said he the visible injuries having been ably relieved i shall look another way for the cause then after another pause i must have his head shaved lady cicely demurred a little to this but dr staines stood firm and his lordships valet undertook the job staines directed him where to begin and when he had made a circular tonsure on the top of the head had it sponged with tepid water i thought so said he here is the mischief and he pointed to a very slight indentation on the left side of the pia mater observe said he there is no corresponding indentation on the other side underneath this trifling depression a minute piece of bone is doubtless pressing on the most sensitive part of the brain he must be trephined mr whites eyes sparkled you are an hospital surgeon sir yes dr staines i have no fear of the operation then i hand the patient over to you the case at present is entirely surgical white was driven home and soon returned with the requisite instruments the operation was neatly performed and then lady cicely was called in she came trembling her brothers fingers were still working but not so regularly that is only habit said staines it will soon leave off now the cause is gone and truly enough in about five minutes the fingers became quiet the eyes became human next and within half an hour after the operation the earl gave a little sigh lady cicely clasped her hands and uttered a little cry of delight this will not do said staines i shall have you screaming when he speaks oh dr staines will he ever speak i think so and very soon so be on your guard this strange scene reached its climax soon after by the earl saying quietly are her knees broke tom lady cicely uttered a little scream but instantly suppressed it no my lord said staines smartly only rubbed a bit you can go to sleep my lord ill take care of the mare all right said his lordship and composed himself to slumber dr staines at the earnest request of lady cicely stayed all night and in course of the day advised her how to nurse the patient since both physician and surgeon had done with him he said the patients brain might be irritable for some days and no women in silk dresses or crinoline or creaking shoes must enter the room he told her the nurse was evidently a clumsy woman and would be letting things fall she had better get some old soldier used to nursing and dont whisper in the room said he nothing irritates them worse and dont let anybody play a piano within hearing but in a day or two you may try him with slow and continuous music on the flute or violin if you like dont touch his bed suddenly dont sit on it or lean on it dole sunlight into his room by degrees and when he can bear it drench him with it never mind what the old school tell you about these things they know a good deal less than nothing lady cicely received all this like an oracle the cure was telegraphed to dr barr and he was requested to settle the fee he was not the man to undersell the profession and was jealous of nobody having a large practice and a very wealthy wife so he telegraphed backfifty guineas and a guinea a mile from london so as christopher staines sat at an early breakfast with the carriage waiting to take him to the train two notes were brought him on a salver they were both directed by lady cicely treherne one of them contained a few kind and feeling words of gratitude and esteem the other a check drawn by the earls steward for one hundred and thirty guineas he bowled up to london and told it all to rosa she sparkled with pride affection and joy now who says you are not a genius she cried a hundred and thirty guineas for one fee now if you love your wife as she loves youyou will set up a brougham chapter viii doctor staines begged leave to distinguish he had not said he would set up a carriage at the first one hundred guinea fee but only that he would not set up one before there are misguided people who would call this logic but rosa said it was equivocating and urged him so warmly that at last he burst out who can go on forever saying no to the only creature he lovesand caved in fortyeight hours more a brougham waited at mrs stainess door the servant engaged to drive it was andrew pearman a bachelor and hitherto an undergroom he readily consented to be coachman and to do certain domestic work as well so mrs staines had a manservant as well as a carriage ere long three or four patients called or wrote one after the other these rosa set down to brougham and crowed she even crowed to lady cicely treherne to whose influence and not to broughams every one of these patients was owing lady cicely kissed her and demurely enjoyed the poor souls selfsatisfaction staines himself while he drove to or from these patients felt more sanguine and buoyed as he was by the consciousness of ability began to hope he had turned the corner he sent an account of lord ayscoughs case to a medical magazine and so full is the world of flunkeyism that this article though he withheld the name retaining only the title got the literary wedge in for him at once and in due course he became a paid contributor to two medical organs and used to study and write more and indent the little stone yard less than heretofore it was about this time circumstances made him acquainted with phoebe dale her intermediate history i will dispose of in fewer words than it deserves her ruin mr reginald falcon was dismissed from his club for marking high cards on the back with his nail this stopped his remaining resourceborrowing so he got more and more out at elbows till at last he came down to hanging about billiardrooms and making a little money by concealing his game from that however he rose to be a marker having culminated to that he wrote and proposed marriage to miss dale in a charming letter she showed it to her father with pride now if his vanity his disloyalty his falsehood his ingratitude and his other virtues had not stood in the way he would have done this three years ago and been jumped at but the offer came too late not for phoebeshe would have taken him in a momentbut for her friends a baited hook is one thing a bare hook is another farmer dale had long discovered where phoebes money went he said not a word to her but went up to town like a shot found falcon out and told him he mustnt think to eat his daughters bread she should marry a man that could make a decent livelihood and if she was to run away with him why theyd starve together the farmer was resolute and spoke very loud like one that expects opposition and comes prepared to quarrel instead of that this artful rogue addressed him with deep respect and an affected veneration that quite puzzled the old man acquiesced in every word expressed contrition for his past misdeeds and told the farmer he had quite determined to labor with his hands you know farmer said he i am not the only gentleman who has come to that in the present day now all my friends that have seen my sketches assure me i am a born painter and a painter ill befor love of phoebe the farmer made a wry face painter that is a sorry sort of a trade you are mistaken its the best trade going there are gentlemen making their thousands a year by it not in our parts there baint stop a bit what be ye going to paint sir housen or folk oh hang it not houses figures landscapes well ye might just make shift to live at it i suppose with here and there a signboard they are the best paid our way but lord bless ye they wants headpiece well sir let me see your work then well talk further ill go to work this afternoon said falcon eagerly then with affected surprise bless me i forgot i have no palette no canvas no colors you couldnt lend me a couple of sovereigns to buy them could you ay sir i could but i woant ill lend ye the things though if you have a mind to go with me and buy em falcon agreed with a lofty smile and the purchases were made mr falcon painted a landscape or two out of his imagination the dealers to whom he took them declined them one advised the gentleman painter to color teaboards thats your line said he the world has no taste said the gentleman painter but it has got lots of vanity ill paint portraits he did and formidable ones his portraits were amazingly like the people and yet unlike men and women especially about the face one thing he didnt trouble with lights and shades but went slap at the features his brush would never have kept him but he carried an instrument in the use of which he was really an artist viz his tongue by wheedling and undersellingfor he only charged a pound for the painted canvashe contrived to live then he aspired to dress as well as live with this second object in view he hit upon a characteristic expedient he used to prowl about and when he saw a young woman sweeping the afternoon streets with a long silk train and in short dressed to ride in the park yet parading the streets he would take his hat off to her with an air of profound respect and ask permission to take her portrait generally he met a prompt rebuff but if the fair was so unlucky as to hesitate a single moment he told her a melting tale he had once driven his fourinhand but by indorsing his friends bills was reduced to painting likeness admirable likenesses in oil only a guinea each his piteous tale provoked more gibes than pity but as he had no shame the rebuffs went for nothing he actually did get a few sitters by his audacity and some of the sitters actually took the pictures and paid for them others declined them with fury as soon as they were finished these he took back with a piteous sigh that sometimes extracted half a crown then he painted over the rejected one and let it dry so that sometimes a paid portrait would present a beauty enthroned on the debris of two or three rivals and that is where few beauties would object to sit all this time he wrote nice letters to phoebe and adopted the tone of the struggling artist and the true lover who wins his bride by patience perseverance and indomitable industry a babbled of self help meantime phoebe was not idle an excellent business woman she took immediate advantage of a new station that was built near the farm to send up milk butter and eggs to london being genuine they sold like wildfire observing that she extended her operations by buying of other farmers and forwarding to london and then having of course an eye to her struggling artist she told her father she must have a shop in london and somebody in it she could depend upon with all my heart wench said he but it must not be thou i cant spare thee may i have dick father dick he is rather young but he is very quick father and minds every word i tell him ay he is as fond of thee as ever a cow was of a calf well you can try him so the lovesick woman of business set up a little shop and put her brother dick in it and all to see more of her struggling artist she stayed several days to open the little shop and start the business she advertised pure milk and challenged scientific analysis of everything she sold this came of her being a reader she knew by the journals that we live in a sinful and adulterating generation and anything pure must be a godsend to the poor poisoned public now dr staines though known to the profession as a diagnost was also an analyst and this challenge brought him down on phoebe dale he told her he was a physician and in search of pure food for his own familywould she really submit the milk to analysis phoebe smiled an honest country smile and said surely sir she gave him every facility and he applied those simple tests which are commonly used in france though hardly known in england he found it perfectly pure and told her so and gazed at phoebe for a moment as a phenomenon she smiled again at that her broad country smile that is a wonder in london i dare say its my belief half the children that die here are perished with watered milk well sir we shant have that on our souls father and i he is a farmer in essex this comes a many miles this milk staines looked in her face with kindly approval marked on his own eloquent features she blushed a little at so fixed a regard then he asked her if she would supply him with milk butter and eggs why if you mean sell you them yes sir with pleasure but for sending them home to you in this big town as some do i cant for theres only brother dick and me it is an experiment like very well said staines i will send for them thank you kindly sir i hope you wont be offended sir but we only sell for ready money all the better my order at home is no bills when he was gone phoebe assuming vast experience though this was only her third day told dick that was one of the right sort and oh dick said she did you notice his eye not particklar sister there now the boy is blind why twas like a jewel such an eye i never saw in a mans head nor a womans neither staines told his wife about phoebe and her brother and spoke of her with a certain admiration that raised rosas curiosity and even that sort of vague jealousy that fires at bare praise i should like to see this phenomenon said she you shall said he i have to call on mrs manly she lives near i will drop you at the little shop and come back for you he did so and that gave rosa a quarter of an hour to make her purchases when he came back he found her conversing with phoebe as if they were old friends and dick glaring at his wife with awe and admiration he could hardly get her away she was far more extravagant in her praises than dr staines had been what a good creature said she and how clever to think of her setting up a shop like that all by herself for her dick is only seventeen dr staines recommended the little shop wherever he went and even extended its operations he asked phoebe to get her own wheat ground at home and send the flour up in bushel bags these assassins the bakers said he are putting copper into the flour now as well as alum pure flour is worth a fancy price to any family with that we can make the bread of life what you buy in the shops is the bread of death dick was a good sharp boy devoted to his sister he stuck to the shop in london and handed the money to phoebe when she came for it she worked for it in essex and extended her country connection for supply as the retail business increased staines wrote an article on pure food and incidentally mentioned the shop as a place where flour milk and butter were to be had pure this article was published in the lancet and caused quite a run upon the little shop by and by phoebe enlarged it for which there were great capabilities and made herself a pretty little parlor and there she and dick sat to falcon for their portraits here too she hung his rejected landscapes they were fair in her eyes what matter whether they were like nature his hand had painted them she knew from him that everybody else had rejected them with all the more pride and love did she have them framed in gold and hung up with the portraits in her little sanctum for a few months phoebe dale was as happy as she deserved to be her lover was working and faithful to herat least she saw no reason to doubt it he came to see her every evening and seemed devoted to her would sit quietly with her or walk with her or take her to a play or a musichallat her expense she now lived in a quiet elysium with a bright and rapturous dream of the future for she saw she had hit on a good vein of business and should soon be independent and able to indulge herself with a husband and ask no mans leave she sent to essex for a dairymaid and set her to churn milk into butter coram populo at a certain hour every morning this made a new sensation at other times the woman was employed to deliver milk and cream to a few favored customers mrs staines dropped in now and then and chatted with her her sweet face and her naivete won phoebes heart and one day as happiness is apt to be communicative she let out to her in reply to a feeler or two as to whether she was quite alone that she was engaged to be married to a gentleman but he is not rich maam said phoebe plaintively he has had trouble obliged to work for his living like me he painted these pictures every one of them if it was not making too free and you could spare a guineahe charges no more for the picture only you must go to the expense of the frame of course i will said rosa warmly ill sit for it here any day you like now rosa said this out of her ever ready kindness not to wound phoebe but having made the promise she kept clear of the place for some days hoping phoebe would forget all about it meantime she sent her husband to buy in about a fortnight she called again primed with evasions if she should be asked to sit but nothing of the kind was proposed phoebe was dealing when she went in the customers disposed of she said to mrs staines oh maam i am glad you are come i have something i should like to show you she took her into the parlor and made her sit down then she opened a drawer and took out a very small substance that looked like a tear of ground glass and put it on the table before her there maam said she that is all he has had for painting a friends picture oh what a shame his friend was going abroadto natal to his uncle that farms out there and does very well it is a firstrate part if you take out a little stock with you and some money so my one gave him credit and when the letter came with that postmark he counted on a fivepound note but the letter only said he had got no money yet but sent him something as a keepsake and there was this little stone poor fellow he flung it down in a passion he was so disappointed phoebes great gray eyes filled and rosa gave a little coo of sympathy that was very womanly and lovable phoebe leaned her cheek on her hand and said thoughtfully i picked it up and brought it away for after alldont you think maam it is very strange that a friend should send it all that way if it was worth nothing at all it is impossible he could not be so heartless and do you know maam when i take it up in my fingers it doesnt feel like a thing that was worth nothing no more it does it makes my fingers tremble may i take it home and show it my husband he is a great physician and knows everything i am sure i should be obliged to you maam rosa drove home on purpose to show it to christopher she ran into his study oh christopher please look at that you know that good creature we have our flour and milk and things of she is engaged and he is a painter oh such daubs he painted a friend and the friend sent that home all the way from natal and he dashed it down and she picked it up and what is it ground glass or a pebble or what humphby its shape and the greatbrilliancyand refraction of light on this angle where the stone has got polished by rubbing against other stones in the course of ages im inclined to think it isa diamond a diamond shrieked rosa no wonder my fingers trembled oh can it be oh you good coldblooded christiepoor thingscome along diamond oh you beauty oh you duck dont be in such a hurry i only said i thought it was a diamond let me weigh it against water and then i shall know he took it to his little laboratory and returned in a few minutes and said yes it is just three times and a half heavier than water it is a diamond are you positive ill stake my existence what is it worth my dear im not a jeweller but it is very large and pearshaped and i see no flaw i dont think you could buy it for less than three hundred pounds three hundred pounds it is worth three hundred pounds or sell it for more than a hundred and fifty pounds a hundred and fifty it is worth a hundred and fifty pounds why my dear one would think you had invented the diamond show me how to crystallize carbon and i will share your enthusiasm oh i leave you to carbonize crystal i prefer to gladden hearts and i will do it this minute with my diamond do dear and i will take that opportunity to finish my article on adulteration rosa drove off to phoebe dale now phoebe was drinking tea with reginald falcon in her little parlor who is that i wonder said she when the carriage drew up reginald drew back a corner of the gauze curtain which had been drawn across the little glass door leading from the shop it is a lady and a beautifuloh let me get out and he rushed out at the door leading to the kitchen not to be recognized this set phoebe all in a flutter and the next moment mrs staines tapped at the little door then opened it and peeped good news may i come in surely said phoebe still troubled and confused by reginalds strange agitation there it is a diamond screamed rosa my husband knew it directly he knows everything if ever you are ill go to him and nobody elseby the refraction and the angle and its being three times and a half as heavy as water it is worth three hundred pounds to buy and a hundred and fifty pounds to sell oh so dont you go throwing it away as he did in a whisper two teacups was that him i have driven him away i am so sorry ill go and then you can tell him poor fellow oh maam dont go yet said phoebe trembling i havent half thanked you oh bother thanks kiss me that is the way may i you may and must thereand thereand there oh dear what nice things good luck and happiness are and how sweet to bring them for once upon this phoebe and she had a nice little cry together and mrs staines went off refreshed thereby and as gay as a lark pointing slyly at the door and making faces to phoebe that she knew he was there and she only retired out of her admirable discretion that they might enjoy the diamond together when she was gone reginald whose eye and ear had been at the keyhole alternately gloating on the face and drinking the accents of the only woman he had ever really loved came out looking pale and strangely disturbed and sat down at table without a word phoebe came back to him full of the diamond did you hear what she said my dear it is a diamond it is worth a hundred and fifty pounds at least why what ails you ah to be sure you know that lady i have cause to know her cursed jilt you seem a good deal put out at the sight of her it took me by surprise that is all it takes me by surprise too i thought you were cured i thought my turn had come at last reginald met this in sullen silence then phoebe was sorry she had said it for after all it wasnt the mans fault if an old sweetheart had run into the room and given him a start so she made him some fresh tea and pressed him kindly to try her homemade bread and butter my lord relaxed his frown and consented and of course they talked diamond he told her loftily he must take a studio and his sitters must come to him and must no longer expect to be immortalized for one pound it must be two pounds for a bust and three pounds for a kitcat nay but my dear said phoebe they will pay no more because you have a diamond then they will have to go unpainted said mr falcon this was intended for a threat phoebe instinctively felt that it might not be so received she counselled moderation it is a great thing to have earned a diamond said she but tis only once in a life now be ruled by me go on just as you are sell the diamond and give me the money to keep for you why you might add a little to it and so would i till we made it up two hundred pounds and if you could only show two hundred pounds you had made and laid by father would let us marry and i might keep this shopit pays well i can tell youand keep my gentleman in a sly corner you need never be seen in it ay ay said he that is the small game but i am a man that have always preferred the big game i shall set up my studio and make enough to keep us both so give me the stone if you please i shall take it round to them all and the rogues wont get it out of me for a hundred and fifty why it is as big as a nut no no reginald money has always made mischief between you and me you never had fifty pounds yet you didnt fall into temptation do pray let me keep it for you or else sell iti know how to sell nobody betterand keep the money for a good occasion is it yours or mine said he sulkily why yours dear you earned it then give it me please and he almost forced it out of her hand so now she sat down and cried over this piece of good luck for her heart filled with forebodings he laughed at her but at last had the grace to console her and assure her she was tormenting herself for nothing time will show said she sadly time did show three or four days he came as usual to laugh her out of her forebodings but presently his visits ceased she knew what that meant he was living like a gentleman melting his diamond and playing her false with the first pretty face he met this blow coming after she had been so happy struck phoebe dale stupid with grief the line on her high forehead deepened and at night she sat with her hands before her sighing and sighing and listening for the footsteps that never came oh dick she said never you love any one i am aweary of my life and to think that but for that diamondoh dear oh dear oh dear then dick used to try and comfort her in his way and often put his arm round her neck and gave her his rough but honest sympathy dicks rare affection was her one drop of comfort it was something to relieve her swelling heart oh dick she said to him one night i wish i had married him what to be illused he couldnt use me worse i have been wife and mother and sweetheart and all to him and to be left like this he treats me like the dirt beneath his feet tis your own fault phoebe partly you say the word and ill break every bone in his carcass what do him a mischief why id rather die than harm a hair of his head you must never lift a hand to him or i shall hate you hate me phoebe ay boy i should god forgive me tis no use deceiving ourselves when a woman loves a man she despises never you come between them theres no reason in her love so it is incurable one comfort it cant go on forever it must kill me before my time and so best if i was only a mother and had a little reginald to dandle on my knee and gloat upon till he spent his money and came back to me thats why i said i wished i was his wife oh why does god fill a poor womans bosom with love and nothing to spend it on but a stone for sure his heart must be one if i had only something that would let me always love it a little toddling thing at my knee that would always let me look at it and love it something too young to be false to me too weak to run away from my longingarmsandyearning heart then came a burst of agony and moans of desolation till poor puzzled dick blubbered loudly at her grief and then her tears flowed in streams trouble on trouble dick himself got strangely out of sorts and complained of shivers phoebe sent him to bed early and made him some white wine whey very hot in the morning he got up and said he was better but after breakfast he was violently sick and suffered several returns of nausea before noon one would think i was poisoned said he at one oclock he was seized with a kind of spasm in the throat that lasted so long it nearly choked him then phoebe got frightened and sent to the nearest surgeon he did not hurry and poor dick had another frightful spasm just as he came in it is hysterical said the surgeon no disease of the heart is there give him a little salvolatile every half hour in spite of the salvolatile these terrible spasms seized him every half hour and now he used to spring off the bed with a cry of terror when they came and each one left him weaker and weaker he had to be carried back by the women a sad sickening fear seized on phoebe she left dick with the maid and tying on her bonnet in a moment rushed wildly down the street asking the neighbors for a great doctor the best that could be had for money one sent her east a mile another west and she was almost distracted when who should drive up but dr and mrs staines to make purchases she did not know his name but she knew he was a doctor she ran to the window and cried oh doctor my brother oh pray come to him oh oh dr staines got quickly but calmly out told his wife to wait and followed phoebe upstairs she told him in a few agitated words how dick had been taken and all the symptoms especially what had alarmed her so his springing off the bed when the spasm came dr staines told her to hold the patient up he lost not a moment but opened his mouth resolutely and looked down the glottis is swollen said he then he felt his hands and said with the grave terrible calm of experience he is dying oh no no oh doctor save him save him nothing can save him unless we had a surgeon on the spot yes i might save him if you have the courage opening his windpipe before the next spasm is his one chance open his windpipe oh doctor it will kill him let me look at you she looked hard in his face it gave her confidence is it the only chance the only one and it is flying while we chatter do it he whipped out his lancet but i cant look on it i trust to you and my saviours mercy she fell on her knees and bowed her head in prayer staines seized a basin put it by the bedside made an incision in the windpipe and got dick down on his stomach with his face over the bedside some blood ran but not much now he cried cheerfully a small bellows theres one in your parlor run phoebe ran for it and at dr staines direction lifted dick a little while the bellows duly cleansed were gently applied to the aperture in the windpipe and the action of the lungs delicately aided by this primitive but effectual means he showed phoebe how to do it tore a leaf out of his pocketbook wrote a hasty direction to an able surgeon near and sent his wife off with it in the carriage phoebe and he never left the patient till the surgeon came with all the instruments required amongst the rest with a big tortuous pair of nippers with which he could reach the glottis and snip it but they consulted and thought it wiser to continue the surer method and so a little tube was neatly inserted into dicks windpipe and his throat bandaged and by this aperture he did his breathing for some little time phoebe nursed him like a mother and the terror and the joy did her good and made her less desolate dick was only just well when both of them were summoned to the farm and arrived only just in time to receive their fathers blessing and his last sigh their elder brother a married man inherited the farm and was executor phoebe and dick were left fifteen hundred pounds apiece on condition of their leaving england and going to natal they knew directly what that meant phoebe was to be parted from a bad man and dick was to comfort her for the loss when this part of the will was read to phoebe she turned faint and only her health and bodily vigor kept her from swooning right away but she yielded it is the will of the dead said she and i will obey it for oh if i had but listened to him more when he was alive to advise me i should not sit here now sick at heart and dryeyed when i ought to be thinking only of the good friend that is gone when she had come to this she became feverishly anxious to be gone she busied herself in purchasing agricultural machines and stores and even stock and to see her pinching the beasts ribs to find their condition and parrying all attempts to cheat her you would never have believed she could be a lovesick woman dick kept her up to the mark he only left her to bargain with the master of a good vessel for it was no trifle to take out horses and cows and machines and bales of cloth cotton and linen when that was settled they came in to town together and phoebe bought shrewdly at wholesale houses in the city for cash and would have bargains and the little shop in street was turned into a warehouse they were all ardor as colonists should be and what pleased dick most she never mentioned falcon yet he learned from the maid that worthy had been there twice looking very seedy the day drew near dick was in high spirits we shall soon make our fortune out there he said and ill get you a good husband she shuddered but said nothing the evening before they were to sail phoebe sat alone in her black dress tired with work and asking herself sick at heart could she ever really leave england when the door opened softly and reginald falcon shabbily dressed came in and threw himself into a chair she started up with a scream then sank down again trembling and turned her face to the wall so you are going to run away from me said he savagely ay reginald said she meekly this is your fine love is it you have worn it out dear she said softly without turning her head from the wall i wish i could say as much but curse it every time i leave you i learn to love you more i am never really happy but when i am with you bless you for saying that dear i often thought you must find that out one day but you took too long oh better late than never phoebe can you have the heart to go to the cape and leave me all alone in the world with nobody that really cares for me surely you are not obliged to go yes my father left dick and me fifteen hundred pounds apiece to go that was the condition poor dick loves his unhappy sister he wont go without mei should be his ruinpoor dick that really loves me and he lay adying here and the good doctor and megod bless himwe brought him back from the grave ah you little know what i have gone through you were not here catch you being near me when i am in trouble there i must go i must go i will go if i fling myself into the sea half way and if you do ill take a dose of poison for i have thrown away the truest heart the sweetest most unselfish kindest generousoh oh oh and he began to howl this set phoebe sobbing dont cry dear she murmured through her tears if you have really any love for me come with me what leave england and go to a desert love can make a desert a garden phoebe ill do anything else ill swear not to leave your side ill never look at any other face but yours but i cant live in africa i know you cant it takes a little real love to go there with a poor girl like me ah well id have made you so happy we are not poor emigrants i have a horse for you to ride and guns to shoot and me and dick would do all the work for you but there are others here you cant leave for me well then goodby dear in africa or here i shall always love you and many a salt tear i shall shed for you yet many a one i have as well you know god bless you pray for poor phoebe that goes against her will to africa and leaves her heart with thee this was too much even for the selfish reginald he kneeled at her knees and took her hand and kissed it and actually shed a tear or two over it she could not speak he had no hope of changing her resolution and presently he heard dicks voice outside so he got up to avoid him ill come again in the morning before you go oh no no she gasped unless you want me to die at your feet i am almost dead now reginald slipped out by the kitchen dick came in and found his sister leaning with her head back against the wall why phoebe said he whatever is the matter and he took her by the shoulder she moaned and he felt her all limp and powerless what is it lass whatever is the matter is it about going away she would not speak for a long time when she did speak it was to say something for which my male reader may not be prepared but it will not surprise the women o dickforgive me why what for forgive me or else kill me i dont care which i do though there i forgive you now whats your crime i cant go forgive me cant go i cant forgive me im blessed if i dont believe that vagabond has been here tormenting of you again oh dont miscall him he is penitent yes dick he has been here crying to meand i cant leave him i canti cant dear dick you are young and stouthearted take all the things over and make your fortune out there and leave your poor foolish sister behind i should only fling myself into the salt sea if i left him now and that would be peace to me but a grief to thee lordsake phoebe dont talk so i cant go without you and do but think why the horses are on board by now and all the gear its my belief a good hiding is all you want to bring you to your senses but i hant the heart to give you one worse luck blessed if i know what to say or do i wont go cried phoebe turning violent all of a sudden no not if i am dragged to the ship by the hair of my head forgive me and with that word she was a mouse again eh but women are kittle cattle to drive said poor dick ruefully and down he sat at a nonplus and very unhappy phoebe sat opposite sullen heartsick wretched to the core but determined not to leave reginald then came an event that might have been foreseen yet it took them both by surprise a light step was heard and a graceful though seedy figure entered the room with a set speech in his mouth phoebe you are right i owe it to your long and faithful affection to make a sacrifice for you i will go to africa with you i will go to the end of the world sooner than you shall say i care for any woman on earth but you both brother and sister were so unprepared for this that they could hardly realize it at first phoebe turned her great inquiring eyes on the speaker and it was a sight to see amazement doubt hope and happiness animating her features one after another is this real said she i will sail with you tomorrow phoebe and i will make you a good husband if you will have me that is spoke like a man said dick you take him at his word phoebe and if he illuses you out there ill break every bone in his skin how dare you threaten him said phoebe you had best leave the room out went poor dick with the tear in his eye at being snubbed so while he was putting up the shutters phoebe was making love to her pseudo penitent my dear said she trust yourself to me you dont know all my love yet for i have never been your wife and i would not be your jade that is the only thing i ever refused you trust yourself to me why you never found happiness with others try it with me it shall be the best days work you ever did going out in the ship with me you dont know how happy a loving wife can make her husband ill pet you out there as man was never petted and besides it isnt for life dick and me will soon make a fortune out there and then ill bring you home and see you spend it any way you like but one oh how i love you do you love me a little i worship the ground you walk on i adore every hair of your head her noble arm went round his neck in a moment and the grandeur of her passion electrified him so far that he kissed her affectionately if not quite so warmly as she did him and so it was all settled the maid was discharged that night instead of the morning and reginald was to occupy her bed phoebe went upstairs with her heart literally on fire to prepare his sleepingroom and so dick and reginald had a word i say dick how long will this voyage be two months sir i am told please to cast your eyes on this suit of mine dont you think it is rather seedyto go to africa with why i shall disgrace you on board the ship i say dick lend me three sovs just to buy a new suit at the slopshop well brotherinlaw said dick i dont see any harm in that ill go and fetch them for you what does this sensible dick do but go upstairs to phoebe and say he wants three pounds to buy a suit am i to lend it him phoebe was shaking and patting her penitents pillow she dropped it on the bed in dismay oh dick not for all the world why if he had three sovereigns hed desert me at the waters edge oh god help me how i love him god forgive me how i mistrust him good dick kind dick say we have suits of clothes and well fit him like a prince as he ought to be on board ship but not a shilling of money and my dear dont put the weight on me you understand ay mistress i understand good dick oh all right and then dont you snap this here good kind dicks nose off at a word again never i get wild if anybody threatens him then im not myself forgive my hasty tongue you know i love you dear oh ay you love me well enough but seems to me your love is precious like cold veal and your love for that chap is hot roast beef ha ha ha ha oh ye can laugh now can ye ha ha ha well the more of that music the better for me yes dear but go and tell him dick went down and said ive got no money to spare till i get to the cape but phoebe has got a box full of suits and i made her promise to keep it out she will dress you like a prince you may be sure oh that is it is it said reginald dryly dick made no reply at nine oclock they were on board the vessel at ten she weighed anchor and a steamvessel drew her down the river about thirty miles then cast off and left her to the southeasterly breeze up went sail after sail she nodded her lofty head and glided away for africa phoebe shed a few natural tears at leaving the shores of old england but they soon dried she was demurely happy watching her prize and asking herself had she really secured it and all in a few hours they had a prosperous voyage were married at cape town and went up the country bag and baggage looking out for a good bargain in land reginald was mounted on an english horse and allowed to zigzag about and shoot and play while his wife and brotherinlaw marched slowly with their cavalcade what with air exercise wholesome food and smiles of welcome and delicious petting this egotist enjoyed himself finely he admitted as much says he one evening to his wife who sat by him for the pleasure of seeing him feed it sounds absurd but i never was so happy in all my life at that the celestial expression of her pastoral face and the maternal gesture with which she drew her pets head to her queenly bosom was a picture for celibacy to gnash the teeth at chapter ix during this period the most remarkable things that happened to dr and mrs staines were really those which i have related as connecting them with phoebe dale and her brother to which i will now add that dr staines detailed dicks case in a remarkable paper entitled oedema of the glottis and showed how the patient had been brought back from the grave by tracheotomy and artificial respiration he received a high price for this article to tell the truth he was careful not to admit that it was he who had opened the windpipe so the credit of the whole operation was given to mr jenkyn and this gentleman was naturally pleased and threw a good many consultation fees in stainess way the lucases to his great comfortfor he had an instinctive aversion to miss lucasleft london for paris in august and did not return all the year in february he reviewed his years work and twelve months residence in the bijou the pecuniary result was outgoings nine hundred and fifty pounds income from fees two hundred and eighty pounds writing ninety pounds he showed these figures to mrs staines and asked her if she could suggest any diminution of expenditure could she do with less housekeeping money oh impossible you cannot think how the servants eat and they wont touch our homemade bread the fools why oh because they think it costs us less servants seem to me always to hate the people whose bread they eat more likely it is their vanity nothing that is not paid for before their eyes seems good enough for them well dear the bakers will revenge us but is there any other item we could reduce dress dress why i spend nothing fortyfive pounds this year well i shall want none next year well then rosa as there is nothing we can reduce i must write more and take more fees or we shall be in the wrong box only eight hundred and sixty pounds left of our little capital and mind we have not another shilling in the world one comfort there is no debt we pay ready money for everything rosa colored a little but said nothing staines did his part nobly he read he wrote he paced the yard he wore his old clothes in the house he took off his new ones when he came in he was all genius drudgery patience how phoebe dale would have valued him cooperated with him and petted him if she had had the good luck to be his wife the season came back and with it miss lucas towing a brilliant bride mrs vivian young rich pretty and gay with a waist you could span and athirst for pleasure this lady was the first that ever made rosa downright jealous she seemed to have everything the female heart could desire and she was no with miss lucas this year now rosa was no last season and had weakly imagined that was to last forever but miss lucas had always a sort of female flame and it never lasted two seasons rosa did not care so very much for miss lucas before except as a convenient friend but now she was mortified to tears at finding miss lucas made more fuss with another than with her this foolish feeling spurred her to attempt a rivalry with mrs vivian in the very things where rivalry was hopeless miss lucas gave both ladies tickets for a flowershow where all the great folk were to be princes and princesses etc but i have nothing to wear sighed rosa then you must get something and mind it is not pink please for we must not clash in colors you know im dark and pink becomes me the selfish young brute was not half so dark as rosa mine is coming from worths in paris on purpose and this new madame cie of regent street has such a duck of a bonnet just come from paris she wanted to make me one from it but i told her i would have none but the pattern bonnetand she knows very well she cant pass a copy off on me let me drive you up there and you can see mine and order one if you like it oh thank you let me just run and speak to my husband first staines was writing for the bare life and a number of german books about him slaving to make a few poundswhen in comes the buoyant figure and beaming face his soul delighted in he laid down his work to enjoy the sunbeam of love oh darling ive only come in for a minute we are going to a flowershow on the th everybody will be so beautifully dressedespecially that mrs vivian i have got ten yards of beautiful blue silk in my wardrobe but that is not enough to make a whole dresseverything takes so much stuff now madame cie does not care to make up dresses unless she finds the silk but miss lucas says she thinks to oblige a friend of hers she would do it for once in a way you know dear it would only take a few yards more and it would last as a dinnerdress for ever so long then she clasped him round the neck and leaned her head upon his shoulder and looked lovingly up in his face i know you would like your rosa to look as well as mrs vivian no one ever looks as well in my eyes as my rosa there the dress will add nothing to your beauty but go and get it to please yourself it is very considerate of you to have chosen something of which you have ten yards already see dear im to receive twenty pounds for this article if research was paid it ought to be a hundred i shall add it all to your allowance for dresses this year so no debt mind but come to me for everything the two ladies drove off to madame cies a pretty shop lined with dark velvet and lace draperies in the back room they were packing a lovely bridal dress going off the following saturday to new york what send from america to london oh dear yes exclaimed madame cie the american ladies are excellent customers they buy everything of the best and the most expensive i have brought a new customer said miss lucas and i want you to do a great favor and that is to match a blue silk and make her a pretty dress for the flowershow on the th madame cie produced a white muslin polonaise which she was just going to send home to the princess to be worn over mauve oh how pretty and simple exclaimed miss lucas i have some lace exactly like that said mrs staines then why dont you have a polonaise the lace is the only expensive part the muslin is a mere nothing and it is such a useful dress it can be worn over any silk it was agreed madame cie was to send for the blue silk and the lace and the dresses were to be tried on on thursday on thursday as rosa went gayly into madame cies back room to have the dresses tried on madame cie said you have a beautiful lace shawl but it wants arranging in five minutes i could astonish you with what i could do to that shawl oh pray do said mrs staines the dressmaker kept her word by the time the blue dress was tried on madame cie had with the aid of a few pins plaits and a bow of blue ribbon transformed the half lace shawl into one of the smartest and distingue things imaginable but when the bill came in at christmas for that five minutes labor and distingue touch she charged one pound eight madame cie then told the ladies in an artfully confidential tone she had a quantity of black silk coming home which she had purchased considerably below cost price and that she should like to make them each a dressnot for her own sake but theirsas she knew they would never meet such a bargain again you know miss lucas she continued we dont want our money when we know our customers christmas is soon enough for us christmas is a long time off thought the young wife nearly ten months i think ill have a black silk madame cie but i must not say anything to the doctor about it just yet or he might think me extravagant no one can ever think a lady extravagant for buying a black silk its such a useful dress lasts foreveralmost days weeks and months rolled on and with them an everrolling tide of flowershows dinners athomes balls operas lawnparties concerts and theatres strange that in one house there should be two people who loved each other yet their lives ran so far apart except while they were asleep the man all industry selfdenial patience the woman all frivolity selfindulgence and amusement both chained to an oar onlyone in a working boat the other in a painted galley the woman got tired first and her charming color waned sadly she came to him for medicine to set her up i feel so languid no no said he no medicine can do the work of wholesome food and rational repose you lack the season of all natures sleep dine at home three days running and go to bed at ten on this the doctors wife went to a chemist for advice he gave her a pink stimulant and as stimulants have two effects viz first to stimulate and then to weaken this did her no lasting good dr staines cursed the london season and threatened to migrate to liverpool but there was worse behind returning one day to his dressingroom just after rosa had come downstairs he caught sight of a red stain in a washhandbasin he examined it it was arterial blood he went to her directly and expressed his anxiety oh it is nothing said she nothing pray how often has it occurred once or twice i must take your advice and be quiet that is all staines examined the housemaid she lied instinctively at first seeing he was alarmed but being urged to tell the truth said she had seen it repeatedly and had told the cook he went downstairs again and sat down looking wretched oh dear said rosa what is the matter now rosa said he very gravely there are two people a woman is mad to deceiveher husband and her physician you have deceived both chapter x i suspect dr staines merely meant to say that she had concealed from him an alarming symptom for several weeks but she answered in a hurry to excuse herself and let the cat out of the bagexcuse my vulgarity it was all that mrs vivians fault she laughed at me so for not wearing them and she has a waist you can spanthe wretch oh then you have been wearing stays clandestinely why you know i have oh what a stupid i have let it all out how could you do it when you knew by experience it is your death but it looks so beautiful a tiny waist it looks as hideous as a chinese foot and to the eye of science far more disgusting it is the cause of so many unlovely diseases just tell me one thing have you looked at mrs vivian minutely i look at all your friends with great anxiety knowing no animal more dangerous than a fool viviana skinny woman with a pretty face lovely hair good teeth dying eyes yes lovely a sure proof of a disordered stomachand a waist pinched in so unnaturally that i said to myself where on earth does this idiot put her liver did you ever read of the frog who burst trying to swell to an ox well here is the rivalry reversed mrs vivian is a bag of bones in a balloon she can machine herself into a wasp but a fine young woman like you with flesh and muscle must kill yourself three or four times before you can make your body as meagre hideous angular and unnatural as vivians but all you ladies are monomaniacs one might as well talk sense to a gorilla it brought you to the edge of the grave i saved you yet you could go andgod grant me patience so i suppose these unprincipled women lent you their stays to deceive your husband no but they laughed at me so thatoh christie im a wretch i kept a pair at the lucases and a pair at madame cies and i put them on now and then but you never appeared here in them what before my tyrant oh no i dared not so you took them off before you came home rosa hung her head and said yes in a reluctant whisper you spent your daylight dressing you dressed to go out dressed again in stays dressed again without them and all to deceive your husband and kill yourself at the bidding of two shallow heartless women who would dance over your grave without a pang of remorse or sentiment of any kind since they live like midges only to dance in the sun and suck some workers blood oh christie im so easily led i am too great a fool to live kill me and she kneeled down and renewed the request looking up in his face with an expression that might have disarmed cain ipsum he smiled superior the question is are you sorry you have been so thoughtless yes dear oh oh will you be very good to make up oh yes only tell me how for it does not come natural to poor me keep out of those womens way for the rest of the season i will bring your stays home and allow me to do what i like with them of course cut them in a million pieces till you are recovered you must be my patient and go nowhere without me that is no punishment i am sure punishment am i the man to punish you i only want to save you well darling it wont be the first time no but i do hope it will be the last chapter xi sublata causa tollitur effectus the stays being gone and dissipation moderated mrs staines bloomed again and they gave one or two unpretending little dinners at the bijou dr staines admitted no false friends to these they never went beyond eight five gentlemen three ladies by this arrangement the terrible discursiveness of the fair and mans cruel disposition to work a subject threadbare were controlled and modified and a happy balance of conversation established lady cicely treherne was always invited and always managed to come for she said they were the most agweeable little paaties in london and the host and hostess both so intewesting in the autumn staines worked double tides with the pen and found a vehicle for medical narratives in a weekly magazine that did not profess medicine this new vein put him in heart his fees towards the end of the year were less than last year because there was no hundredguinea fee but there was a marked increase in the small fees and the unflagging pen had actually earned him two hundred pounds or nearly so he was in good spirits not so mrs staines for some time she had been uneasy fretful and like a person with a weight on her mind one sunday she said to him oh dear i do feel so dull nobody to go to church with nor yet to the zoo ill go with you said staines you will to which to both in for a penny in for a pound so to church they went and staines whose motto was hoc age minded his book rosa had intervals of attention to the words but found plenty of time to study the costumes during the litany in bustled clara the housemaid with a white jacket on so like her mistresss that rosa clutched her own convulsively to see whether she had not been skinned of it by some devilish sleightofhand no it was on her back but claras was identical in her excitement rosa pinched staines and with her nose that went like a waterwagtail pointed out the malefactor then she whispered look how dare she my very jacket earrings too and brooches and dresses her hair like mine well never mind whispered staines sunday is her day we have got all the week to shine there dont look at herfrom all evil speaking lying and slandering i cant keep my eyes off her attend to the litany do you know this is really a beautiful composition id rather do the work fifty times over myself hush people will hear you when they walked home after church staines tried to divert her from the consideration of her wrongs but noall other topics were too flat by comparison she mourned the hard fate of mistressesunfortunate creatures that could not do without servants is not that a confession that servants are good useful creatures with all their faults then as to the mania for dress why that is not confined to them it is the mania of the sex are you free from it no of course not but i am a lady if you please then she is your intellectual inferior and more excusable anyway it is wise to connive at a thing we cant help what keep her after this no never my dear pray do not send her away for she is tidy in the house and quick and better than any one we have had this last six months and you know you have tried a great number to hear you speak one would think it was my fault that we have so many bad servants i never said it was your fault but i think dearest a little more forbearance in trifles trifles triflesfor a mistress and maid to be seen dressed alike in the same church you take the servants part against me that you do you should not say that even in jest come now do you really think a jacket like yours can make the servant look like you or detract from your grace and beauty there is a very simple way put your jacket by for a future occasion and wear something else in its stead at church a nice thing indeed to give in to these creatures i wont do it why wont you this once because i wontthere that is unanswerable said he mrs staines said that but when it came to acting she deferred to her husbands wish she resigned her intention of sending for clara and giving her warning on the contrary when clara let her in and the white jackets rubbed together in the narrow passage she actually said nothing but stalked to her own room and tore her jacket off and flung it on the floor unfortunately she was so long dressing for the zoo that clara came in to arrange the room she picks up the white jacket takes it in both hands gives it a flap and proceeds to hang it up in the wardrobe then the great feminine heart burst its bounds you can leave that alone i shall not wear that again thereupon ensued an uneven encounter clara being one of those of whom the scripture says the poison of asps is under their tongues la maam said she why taint so very dirty no but it is too common oh because ive got one like it ay missises cant abide a goodlooking servant nor to see em dressed becoming mistresses do not like servants to forget their place nor wear what does not become their situation my situation why i can pay my way go where i will i dont tremble at the tradesmens knock as some do leave the room leave it this moment leave the room yesand ill leave the house too and tell all the neighbors what i know about it she flounced out and slammed the door and rosa sat down trembling clara rushed to the kitchen and there told the cook and andrew pearman how she had given it to the mistress and every word she had said to her with a good many more she had not the cook laughed and encouraged her but andrew pearman was wroth and said you to affront our mistress like that why if i had heard you id have twisted your neck for ye it would take a better man than you to do that you mind your own business stick to your onehorse chay well im not above my place for that matter but you gals must always be aping your betters i have got a proper pride that is all and you havent you ought to be ashamed of yourself to do two mens work drive a brougham and wait on a horse and then come in and wait at table you are a teakettle groom that is what you are why my brother was coachman to lord fitzjames and gave his lordship notice the first time he had to drive the children says he i dont object to the children my lord but with her ladyship in the carriage its such servants as you as spoil places no servant as knows whats due to a servant ought to know you theyd scorn your quaintance as i do mr pearman you are a stuckup hussy and a soldiers jade roared andrew and you are a low teakettle groom this expression wounded the great equestrian soul to the quick the rest of sunday he pondered on it the next morning he drove the doctor as usual but with a heavy heart meantime the cook made haste and told the baker pearman had got it hot from the housemaid and she had called him a teakettle groom and in less than half an hour after that it was in every stable in the mews why as pearman was taking the horse out of the brougham didnt two little redheaded urchins call out here come and see the teakettle groom and at night some mischievous boy chalked on the black door of the stable a large white teakettle and next morning a drunken idle fellow with a clay pipe in his mouth and a dirty pair of corduroy trousers no coat but a shirt very open at the chest showing inflamed skin the effect of drink inspected that work of art with blinking eyes and vacillating toes and said this comes of a chap doing too much a few more like you and work would be scarce a fine thing for gentlefolks to make one man fill two places but it aint the gentlefolks fault its the man as humors em pearman was a peaceable man and made no reply but went on with his work only during the day he told his master that he should be obliged to him if he would fill his situation as soon as convenient the master inquired the cause and the man told him and said the mews was too hot for him the doctor offered him five pounds a year more knowing he had a treasure but pearman said with sadness and firmness that he had made up his mind to go and go he would the doctors heart fairly sank at the prospect of losing the one creature he could depend upon next sunday evening clara was out and fell in with friends to whom she exaggerated her grievance then they worked her up to fury after the manner of servants friends she came home packed her box brought it down and then flounced into the room to doctor and mrs staines and said i shant sleep another night in this house rosa was about to speak but dr staines forbade her he said you had better think twice of that you are a good servant though for once you have been betrayed into speaking disrespectfully why forfeit your character and three weeks wages i dont care for my wages i wont stay in such a house as this come you must not be impertinent i dont mean to sir said she lowering her voice suddenly then raising it as suddenly there are my keys maam and you can search my box mrs staines will not search your box and you will retire at once to your own part of the house ill go farther than that said she and soon after the street door was slammed the bijou shook at six oclock next morning she came for her box it had been put away for safety pearman told her she must wait till the doctor came down she did not wait but went at eleven am to a policemagistrate and took out a summons against dr staines for detaining a box containing certain articles specifiedvalue under fifteen pounds when dr staines heard she had been for her box but left no address he sent pearman to hunt for her he could not find her she avoided the house but sent a woman for her diurnal love letters dr staines sent the woman back to fetch her she came received her box her letters and the balance of her wages which was small for staines deducted the three weeks wages two days afterwards to his surprise the summons was served out of respect for a court of justice however humble dr staines attended next monday to meet the summons the magistrate was an elderly man with a face shaped like a hogs but much richer in color being purple and pimply so foul a visage staines had rarely seen even in the lowest class of the community clara swore that her box had been opened and certain things stolen out of it and that she had been refused the box next morning staines swore that he had never opened the box and that if any one else had it was with her consent for she had left the keys for that purpose he bade the magistrate observe that if a servant went away like this and left no address she put it out of the masters power to send her box after her and he proved he had some trouble to force the box on her the pigfaced beak showed a manifest leaning towards the servant but there wasnt a leg to stand on and he did not believe nor was it credible that anything had been stolen out of her box at this moment pearman sent by rosa entered the court with an old gown of claras that had been discovered in the scullery and a scribblingbook of the doctors which clara had appropriated and written amorous verses in very superiorin numberto those that have come down to us from anacreon hand me those said the pigfaced beak what are they dr staines i really dont know i must ask my servant why more things of mine that have been detained said clara some things that have been found since she left said staines oh those that hide know where to find young woman said staines do not insult those whose bread you have eaten and who have given you many presents besides your wages since you are so ready to accuse people of stealing permit me to say that this book is mine and not yours and yet you see it is sent after you because you have written your trash in it the purple pigfaced beak went instantly out of the record and wasted a deal of time reading claras poetry and trying to be witty he raised the question whose book this was the girl swore that it was given her by a lady who was now in rome staines swore he bought it of a certain stationer and happening to have his passbook in his pocket produced an entry corresponding with the date of the book the pigfaced beak said that the doctors was an improbable story and that the gown and the book were quite enough to justify the summons verdict one guinea costs what because two things she never demanded have been found and sent after her this is monstrous i shall appeal to your superiors if you are impertinent ill fine you five pounds very well sir now hear me if this is an honest judgment i pray god i may be dead before the years out and if it isnt i pray god you may be then the pigfaced beak fired up and threatened to fine him for blaspheming he deigned no reply but paid the guinea and clara swept out of the court with a train a yard long and leaning on the arm of a scarlet soldier who avenged dr staines with military promptitude christopher went home raging internally for hitherto he had never seen so gross a case of injustice one of his humble patients followed him and said i wish i had known sir you shouldnt have come here to be insulted why no gentleman can ever get justice against a servant girl when he is sitting it is notorious and that makes these hussies so bold ive seen that jade here with the same story twice afore staines reached home more discomposed than he could have himself believed the reason was that barefaced injustice in a court of justice shook his whole faith in man he opened the street door with his latchkey and found two men standing in the passage he inquired what they wanted well sir said one of them civilly enough we only want our due for what for goods delivered at this house sir balance of account and he handed him a butchers bill l s d you must be mistaken we run no bills here we pay ready money for everything well sir said the butcher there have been payments but the balance has always been gaining and we have been put off so often we determined to see the master show you the books sir and welcome this instant if you please he took the butchers address who then retired and the other tradesman a grocer told him a similar tale balance sixty pounds odd he went to the butchers sick at heart inspected the books and saw that right or wrong they were incontrovertible that debt had been gaining slowly but surely almost from the time he confided the accounts to his wife she had kept faith with him about five weeks no more the grocers books told a similar tale the debtor put his hand to his heart and stood a moment the very grocer pitied him and said theres no harry doctor a trifle on account if settlement in full not convenient just now i see you have been kept in the dark no no said christopher ill pay every shilling he gave one gulp and hurried away at the fishmongers the same story only for a smaller amount a bill of nineteen pounds at the very pastrycooks a place she had promised him as her physician never to enter at the drapers thirtyseven pounds odd in short wherever she had dealt the same system partial payments and evergrowing debt remembering madame cie he drove in a cab to regent street and asked for mrs stainess account shall i send it sir no i will take it with me miss edwards make out mrs stainess account if you please miss edwards was a good while making it out but it was ready at last he thrust it into his pocket without daring to look at it there but he went into verreys and asked for a cup of coffee and perused the document the principal items were as follows may reshaping and repairing elegant lace mantle chip bonnet feather and flowers may making and trimming blue silk dressmaterial part found five yards rich blue silk to match june polonaise and jacket trimmed with lace material part found june one black silk dress handsomely trimmed with jet guipure and lace a few shreds and fragments of finery bought at odd times swelled the bill to l s dnot to terrify the female mind with three figures and let no unsophisticated young lady imagine that the trimmings which constituted threefourths of this bill were worth anything the word lace in madame cies bill invariably meant machinemade trash worth tenpence a yard but charged eighteen shillings a yard for one pennyworth of work in putting it on where real lace was used madame cie always let her customers know it miss lucass bill for this year contained the two following little items rich gros de cecile polonaise and jacket to match trimmed with chantilly lace and valenciennes superb robe de chambre richly trimmed with skunk fur the customer found the stuff viz two shawls carolina found the nasty little polecats and got twentyfour shillings for them madame cie found the rest but christopher staines had not miss lucass bill to compare his wifes with he could only compare the latter with their income and with male notions of common sense and reason he went home and into his studio and sat down on his hard beech chair he looked round on his books and his work and then for the first time remembered how long and how patiently he had toiled for every hundred pounds he had made and he laid the evidences of his wifes profusion and deceit by the side of those signs of painful industry and selfdenial and his soul filled with bitterness deceit deceit mrs staines heard he was in the house and came to know about the trial she came hurriedly in and caught him with his head on the table in an attitude of prostration quite new to him he raised his head directly he heard her and revealed a face pale stern and wretched oh what is the matter now said she the matter is what it has always been if i could only have seen it you have deceived me and disgraced yourself look at those bills what bills oh you have had an allowance for housekeeping it wasnt enough it was plenty if you had kept faith with me and paid ready money it was enough for the first five weeks i am housekeeper now and i shall allow myself two pounds a week less and not owe a shilling either well all i know is i couldnt do it no woman could then you should have come to me and said so and i would have shown you how was i in egypt or at the north pole that you could not find me to treat me like a friend you have ruined us these debts will sweep away the last shilling of our little capital but it isnt that oh no it is the miserable deceit rosas eye caught the sum total of madame cies bill and she turned pale oh what a cheat that woman is but she turned paler when christopher said that is the one honest bill for i gave you leave it is these that part us these these look at them false heart there go and pack up your things we can live here no longer we are ruined i must send you back to your father i thought you would sooner or later said mrs staines panting trembling but showing a little fight he told you i wasnt fit to be a poor mans wife an honest mans wife you mean that is what you are not fit for you will go home to your father and i shall go into some humble lodging to work for you ill contrive to keep you and find you a hundred a year to spend in dressthe only thing your heart can really love but i wont have an enemy here in the disguise of a friend and i wont have a wife about me i must treat like a servant and watch like a traitor the words were harsh but the agony with which they were spoken distinguished them from vulgar vituperation they overpowered poor rosa she had been ailing a little some time and from remorse and terror coupled with other causes nature gave way her lips turned white she gasped inarticulately and with a little piteous moan tottered and swooned dead away he was walking wildly about ready to tear his hair when she tottered he saw her just in time to save her and laid her gently on the floor and kneeled over her away went anger and every other feeling but love and pity for the poor weak creature that with all her faults was so lovable and so loved he applied no remedies at first he knew they were useless and unnecessary he laid her head quite low and opened door and window and loosened all her dress sighing deeply all the time at her condition while he was thus employed suddenly a strange cry broke from him a cry of horror remorse joy tenderness all combined a cry compared with which language is inarticulate his swift and practical eye had made a discovery he kneeled over her with his eyes dilating and his hands clasped a picture of love and tender remorse she stirred then he made haste and applied his remedies and brought her slowly back to life he lifted her up and carried her in his arms quite away from the bills and things that when she came to she might see nothing to revive her distress he carried her to the drawingroom and kneeled down and rocked her in his arms and pressed her again and again gently to his heart and cried over her o my dove my dove the tender creature god gave me to love and cherish and have i used it harshly if i had only known if i had only known while he was thus bemoaning her and blaming himself and crying over her like the rainhe whom she had never seen shed a tear before in all his troublesshe was coming to entirely and her quick ears caught his words and she opened her lovely eyes on him i forgive you dear she said feebly but i hope you will be a kinder father than a husband these quiet words spoken with rare gravity and softness went through the great heart like a knife he gave a sort of shiver but said not a word but that night he made a solemn vow to god that no harsh word from his lips should ever again strike a being so weak so loving and so beyond his comprehension why look for courage and candor in a creature so timid and shy she could not even tell her husband that until with her subtle sense she saw he had discovered it chapter xii to be a father to have an image of his darling rosa and a fruit of their love to live and work for this gave the sore heart a heavenly glow and elasticity to bear should this dear object be born to an inheritance of debt of poverty never he began to act as if he was even now a father he entreated rosa not to trouble or vex herself he would look into their finances and set all straight he paid all the bills and put by a quarters rent and taxes then there remained of his little capital just ten pounds he went to his printers and had a thousand orderchecks printed these forms ran thus dr staines of dear street mayfair blank for date orders of blank here for tradesman and goods ordered for cash received same time blank for tradesmans receipt notice dr staines disowns all orders not printed on this form and paid for at date of order he exhibited these forms and warned all the tradespeople before a witness whom he took round for that purpose he paid off pearman on the spot pearman had met clara dressed like a pauper her soldier having emptied her box to the very dregs and he now offered to stay but it was too late staines told the cook mrs staines was in delicate health and must not be troubled with anything she must come to him for all orders yes sir said she but she no sooner comprehended the check system fully than she gave warning it put a stop to her wholesale pilfering rosas cooks had made fully a hundred pounds out of her amongst them since she began to keep accounts under the male housekeeper every article was weighed on delivery and this soon revealed that the butcher and the fishmonger had habitually delivered short weight from the first besides putting down the same thing twice the things were sent back that moment with a printed form stating the nature and extent of the fraud the washerwoman who had been pilfering wholesale so long as mrs staines and her sloppyheaded maids counted the linen and then forgot it was brought up with a run by triplicate forms and by staines counting the things before two witnesses and compelling the washerwoman to count them as well and verify or dispute on the spot the laundress gave warninga plain confession that stealing had been part of her trade he kept the house well for three pounds a week exclusive of coals candles and wine his wife had had five pounds and whatever she asked for dinnerparties yet found it not half enough upon her method he kept no coachman if he visited a patient a man in the yard drove him at a shilling per hour by these means and by working like a galley slave he dragged his expenditure down almost to a level with his income rosa was quite content at first and thought herself lucky to escape reproaches on such easy terms but by and by so rigorous a system began to gall her one day she fancied a bath bun sent the new maid to the pastrycooks pastrycook asked to see the doctors order maid could not show it and came back bunless rosa came into the study to complain to her husband a bath bun said staines why they are colored with annotto to save an egg and annotto is adulterated with chromates that are poison adulteration upon adulteration ill make you a real bath bun off coat and into the kitchen and made her three pure but rather heavy he brought them her in due course she declined them languidly she was off the notion as they say in scotland if i cant have a thing when i want it i dont care for it at all such was the principle she laid down for his future guidance he sighed and went back to his work she cleared the plate one day when she asked for the carriage he told her the time was now come for her to leave off carriage exercise she must walk with him every day instead but i dont like walking i am sorry for that but it is necessary to you and by and by your life may depend on it quietly but inexorably he dragged her out walking every day in one of these walks she stopped at a shop window and fell in love with some babys things oh i must have that said she i must i shall die if i dont youll see now you shall said he when i can pay for it and drew her away the tears of disappointment stood in her eyes and his heart yearned over her but he kept his head he changed the dinner hour to six and used to go out directly afterwards she began to complain of his leaving her alone like that well but wait a bit said he suppose i am making a little money by it to buy you something you have set your heart on poor darling in a very few days after this he brought her a little box with a slit in it he shook it and money rattled then he unlocked it and poured out a little pile of silver there said he put on your bonnet and come and buy those things she put on her bonnet and on the way she asked how it came to be all in silver that is a puzzler said he isnt it and how did you make it dear by writing no by fees from the poor people what undersell my brethren hang it no my dear i made it honestly and some day i will tell you how i made it at present all i will tell you is this i saw my darling longing for something she had a right to long for i saw the tears in her sweet eyes andoh come along do i am wretched till i see you with the things in your hand they went to the shop and staines sat and watched rosa buying babyclothes oh it was a pretty sight to see this modest young creature little more than a child herself anticipating maternity but blushing every now and then and looking askant at her lord and master how his very bowels yearned over her and when they got home she spread the things on a table and they sat hand in hand and looked at them and she leaned her head on his shoulder and went quietly to sleep there and yet as time rolled on she became irritable at times and impatient and wanted all manner of things she could not have and made him unhappy then he was out from six oclock till one and she took it into her head to be jealous so many hours to spend away from her now that she wanted all his comfort presently ellen the new maid got gossiping in the yard and a groom told her her master had a sweetheart on the sly he thought for he drove the brougham out every evening himself and said the man he wears a mustache at night ellen ran in brimful of this and told the cook the cook told the washerwoman the washerwoman told a dozen families till about two hundred people knew it at last it came to mrs staines in a roundabout way at the very moment when she was complaining to lady cicely treherne of her hard lot she had been telling her she was nothing more than a layfigure in the house my husband is housekeeper now and cook and all and makes me delicious dishes i can tell you such curries i couldnt keep the house with five pounds a week so now he does it with three and i never get the carriage because walking is best for me and he takes it out every night to make money i dont understand it lady cicely suggested that perhaps dr staines thought it best for her to be relieved of all worry and so undertook the housekeeping no no no said rosa i used to pay them all a part of their bills and then a little more and so i kept getting deeper and i was ashamed to tell christie so that he calls deceit and oh he spoke to me so cruelly once but he was very sorry afterwards poor dear why are girls brought up so silly all piano and no sense and why are men sillier still to go and marry such silly things a wife i am not so much as a servant oh i am finely humiliated and with a sudden hearty naivete all her own it serves me just right while lady cicely was puzzling this out in came a letter rosa opened it read it and gave a cry like a wounded deer oh she cried i am a miserable woman what will become of me the letter informed her bluntly that her husband drove his brougham out every night to pursue a criminal amour while rosa was wringing her hands in real anguish of heart lady cicely read the letter carefully i dont believe this said she quietly not true why who would be so wicked as to stab a poor inoffensive wretch like me if it wasnt true the first ugly woman would in a minute dont you see the witer cant tell you where he goes dwives his bwougham out that is all your infaumant knows oh my dear friend bless you what have i been complaining to you about all is light except to lose his love what shall i do i will never tell him i will never affront him by saying i suspected him wosa if you do that you will always have a serpent gnawing you no you must put the letter quietly into his hand and say is there any truth in that oh i could not i havent the courage if i do that i shall know by his face if there is any truth in it well and you must know the twuth you shall know it i want to know it too for if he does not love you twuly i will nevaa twust myself to anything so deceitful as a man rosa at last consented to follow this advice after dinner she put the letter into christophers hand and asked him quietly was there any truth in that then her hands trembled and her eyes drank him christopher read it and frowned then he looked up and said no not a word what scoundrels there are in the world to go and tell you that now why you little goose have you been silly enough to believe it no said she irresolutely but do you drive the brougham out every night except sunday where my dear wife i never loved you as i love you now and if it was not for you i should not drive the brougham out of nights that is all i shall tell you at present but some day ill tell you all about it he took such a calm high hand with her about it that she submitted to leave it there but from this moment the serpent doubt nibbled her it had one curious effect though she left off complaining of trifles now it happened one night that lady cicely treherne and a friend were at a concert in hanover square the other lady felt rather faint and lady cicely offered to take her home the carriages had not yet arrived and miss macnamara said to walk a few steps would do her good a smart cabman saw them from a distance and drove up and touching his hat said cab ladies it seemed a very superior cab and miss macnamara said yes directly the cabman bustled down and opened the door miss macnamara got in first then lady cicely her eye fell on the cabmans face which was lighted full by a streetlamp and it was christopher staines he started and winced but the woman of the world never moved a muscle where to said staines averting his head she told him where and when they got out said ill send it you by the servant a flunkey soon after appeared with halfacrown and the amateur coachman drove away he said to himself come my mustache is a better disguise than i thought next day and the day after he asked rosa with affected carelessness had she heard anything of lady cicely no dear but i dare say she will call this afternoon it is her day she did call at last and after a few words with rosa became a little restless and asked if she might consult dr staines certainly dear come to his studio no might i see him here certainly she rang the bell and told the servant to ask dr staines if he would be kind enough to step into the drawingroom dr staines came in and bowed to lady cicely and eyed her a little uncomfortably she began however in a way that put him quite at his ease you remember the advice you gave us about my little cousin tadcastah perfectly his life is very precarious he is bilious consumptive and if not watched will be epileptical and he has a fond weak mother who will let him kill himself exactly and you wecommended a sea voyage with a medical attendant to watch his diet and contwol his habits well she took other advice and the youth is worse so now she is fwightened and a month ago she asked me to pwopose to you to sail about with tadcastah and she offered me a thousand pounds a year i put on my stiff look and said countess with every desiah to oblige you i must decline to cawwy that offah to a man of genius learning and weputation who has the ball at his feet in london lord forgive you lady cicely lord bless her for standing up for my christie lady cicely continued now this good lady you must know is not exactly one of us the late earl mawwied into cotton or wool or something so she said name your price for him i shwugged my shoulders smiled affably and as affectedly as you like and changed the subject but since then things have happened i am afwaid it is my duty to make you the judge whether you choose to sail about with that little cubrosa i can beat about the bush no longer is it a fit thing that a man of genius at whose feet we ought all to be sitting with reverence should drive a cab in the public streets yes rosa staines your husband drives his brougham out at night not to visit any other lady as that anonymous wretch told you but to make a few misewable shillings for you oh christie it is no use dr staines i must and will tell her my dear he drove me three nights ago he had a cabmans badge on his poor arm if you knew what i suffered in those five minutes indeed it seems cruel to speak of itbut i could not keep it from rosa and the reason i muster courage to say it before you sir it is because i know she has other friends who keep you out of their consultations and after all it is the world that ought to blush and not you her ladyships kindly bosom heaved and she wanted to cry so she took her handkerchief out of her pocket without the least hurry and pressed it delicately to her eyes and did cry quietly but without any disguise like a brave lady who neither cried nor did anything else she was ashamed to be seen at as for rosa she sat sobbing round christophers neck and kissed him with all her soul dear me said christopher you are both very kind but begging your pardon it is much ado about nothing lady cicely took no notice of that observation so rosa dear said she i think you are the person to decide whether he had not better sail about with that little cub thanoh i will settle that said staines i have one beloved creature to provide for i may have another i must make money turning a brougham into a cab whatever you may think is an honest way of making it and i am not the first doctor who has coined his brougham at night but if there is a good deal of money to be made by sailing with lord tadcaster of course i should prefer that to cabdriving for i have never made above twelve shillings a night oh as to that she shall give you fifteen hundred a year then i jump at it what and leave me yes love leave youfor your good and only for a time lady cicely it is a noble offer my darling rosa will have every comfortay every luxury till i come home and then we will start afresh with a good balance and with more experience than we did at first lady cicely gazed on him with wonder she said oh what stout hearts men have no no dont let him go see he is acting his great heart is torn with agony i will have no hand in parting man and wifeno not for a day and she hurried away in rare agitation rosa fell on her knees and asked christophers pardon for having been jealous and that day she was a flood of divine tenderness she repaid him richly for driving the cab but she was unnaturally cool about lady cicely and the exquisite reason soon came out oh yes she is very good very kind but it is not for me now no you shall not sail about with her cub of a cousin and leave me at such a time christopher groaned christie you shall not see that lady again she came here to part us she is in love with you i was blind not to see it before next day as lady cicely sat alone in the morningroom thinking over this very scene a footman brought in a card and a note dr staines begs particularly to see lady cicely treherne the ladys pale cheek colored she stood irresolute a single moment i will see dr staines said she dr staines came in looking pale and worn he had not slept a wink since she saw him last she looked at him full and divined this at a glance she motioned him to a seat and sat down herself with her white hand pressing her forehead and her head turned a little away from him chapter xiii he told her he had come to thank her for her great kindness and to accept the offer she sighed i hoped it was to decline it think of the misery of separation both to you and her it will be misery but we are not happy as it is and she cannot bear poverty nor is it fair she should when i can give her every comfort by just playing the man for a year or two he then told lady cicely there were more reasons than he chose to mention go he must and would and he implored her not to let the affair drop in short he was sad but resolved and she found she must go on with it or break faith with him she took her desk and wrote a letter concluding the bargain for him she stipulated for half the years fee in advance she read dr staines the letter you are a friend said he i should never have ventured on that it will be a godsend to my poor rosa you will be kind to her when i am gone i will so will uncle philip i think i will see him before i go and shake hands he has been a good friend to me but he was too hard upon her and i could not stand that then he thanked and blessed her again with the tears in his eyes and left her more disturbed and tearful than she had ever been since she grew to woman o cruel poverty she thought that such a man should be torn from his home and thank me for doing itall for a little moneyand here are we poor commonplace creatures rolling in it staines hurried home and told his wife she clung to him convulsively and wept bitterly but she made no direct attempt to shake his resolution she saw by his iron look that she could only afflict not turn him next day came lady cicely to see her lady cicely was very uneasy in her mind and wanted to know whether rosa was reconciled to the separation rosa received her with a forced politeness and an icy coldness that petrified her she could not stay long in face of such a reception at parting she said sadly you look on me as an enemy what else can you expect when you part my husband and me said rosa with quiet sternness i meant well said lady cicely sorrowfully but i wish i had never interfered so do i and she began to cry lady cicely made no answer she went quietly away hanging her head sadly rosa was unjust but she was not rude nor vulgar and lady cicelys temper was so well governed that it never blinded her heart she withdrew but without the least idea of quarrelling with her afflicted friend or abandoning her she went quietly home and wrote to lady to say that she should be glad to receive dr stainess advance as soon as convenient since mrs staines would have to make fresh arrangements and the money might be useful the money was forthcoming directly lady cicely brought it to dear street and handed it to dr staines his eyes sparkled at the sight of it give my love to rosa said she softly and cut her visit very short staines took the money to rosa and said see what our best friend has brought us you shall have four hundred and i hope after the bitter lessons you have had you will be able to do with that for some months the two hundred i shall keep as a reserve fund for you to draw on no no said rosa i shall go and live with my father and never spend a penny o christie if you knew how i hate myself for the folly that is parting us oh why dont they teach girls sense and money instead of music and the globes but christopher opened a banking account for her and gave her a checkbook and entreated her to pay everything by check and run no bills whatever and she promised he also advertised the bijou and put a bill in the window the lease of this house and the furniture to be sold rosa cried bitterly at sight of it thinking how high in hope they were when they had their first dinner there and also when she went to her first sale to buy the furniture cheap and now everything moved with terrible rapidity the amphitrite was to sail from plymouth in five days and meantime there was so much to be done that the days seemed to gallop away dr staines forgot nothing he made his will in duplicate leaving all to his wife he left one copy at doctors commons and another with his lawyer inventoried all his furniture and effects in duplicate too wrote to uncle philip and then called on him to seek a reconciliation unfortunately dr philip was in scotland at last this sad pair went down to plymouth together there to meet lord tadcaster and go on board hms amphitrite lying out at anchor under orders for the australian station they met at the inn as appointed and sent word of their arrival on board the frigate asking to remain on shore till the last minute dr staines presented his patient to rosa and after a little while drew him apart and questioned him professionally he then asked for a private room here he and rosa really took leave for what could the poor things say to each other on a crowded quay he begged her forgiveness on his knees for having once spoken harshly to her and she told him with passionate sobs he had never spoken harshly to her her folly it was had parted them poor wretches they clung together with a thousand vows of love and constancy they were to pray for each other at the same hours to think of some kind word or loving act at other stated hours and so they tried to fight with their suffering minds against the cruel separation and if either should die the other was to live wedded to memory and never listen to love from other lips but no god was pitiful he would let them meet again ere long to part no more they rocked in each others arms they cried over each otherit was pitiful at last the cruel summons came they shuddered as if it was their deathblow christopher with a face of agony was yet himself and would have parted then and so best but rosa could not she would see the last of him and became almost wild and violent when he opposed it then he let her come with him to milbay steps but into the boat he would not let her step the ships boat lay at the steps manned by six sailors all seated with their oars tossed in two vertical rows a smart middy in charge conducted them and dr staines and lord tadcaster got in leaving rosa in charge of her maid on the quay shove offdowngive way each order was executed so swiftly and surely that in as many seconds the boat was clear the oars struck the water with a loud splash and the husband was shot away like an arrow and the wifes despairing cry rang on the stony quay as many a poor womans cry had rung before in half a minute the boat shot under the stern of the frigate they were received on the quarterdeck by captain hamilton he introduced them to the officersa torture to poor staines to have his mind taken for a single instant from his wifethe first lieutenant came aft and reported ready for making sail sir staines seized the excuse rushed to the other side of the vessel leaned over the taffrail as if he would fly ashore and stretched out his hands to his beloved rosa and she stretched out her hands to him they were so near he could read the expression of her face it was wild and troubled as one who did not yet realize the terrible situation but would not be long first hands make sailaway aloftup anchorrang in christophers ear as if in a dream all his soul and senses were bent on that desolate young creature how young and amazed her lovely face yet this bewildered child was about to become a mother even a strangers heart might have yearned with pity for her how much more her miserable husbands the capstan was manned and worked to a merry tune that struck chill to the bereaved yards were braced for casting anchor hove catted and fished sail was spread with amazing swiftness the ships head dipped and slowly and gracefully paid off towards the breakwater and she stood out to sea under swiftlyswelling canvas and a light northwesterly breeze staines only felt the motion his body was in the ship his soul with his rosa he gazed he strained his eyes to see her eyes as the ship glided from england and her while he was thus gazing and trembling all over up came to him a smart second lieutenant with a brilliant voice that struck him like a sword captains orders to show you berths please choose for lord tadcaster and yourself the mans wild answer made the young officer stare oh sir not nowtry and do my duty when i have quite lost hermy poor wifea childa mothertheresiron the stepstherethere now this officer always went to sea singing oh be joyful but a strong mans agony who can make light of it it was a revelation to him but he took it quickly the first thing he did being a man of action was to dash into his cabin and come back with a short powerful double glass there said he roughly but kindly and shoved it into stainess hand he took it stared at it stupidly then used it without a word of thanks so wrapped was he in his anguish this glass prolonged the misery of that bitter hour when rosa could no longer tell her husband from another she felt he was really gone and she threw her hands aloft and clasped them above her head with the wild abandon of a woman who could never again be a child and staines saw it and a sharp sigh burst from him and he saw her maid and others gather round her he saw the poor young thing led away with her head all down as he had never seen her before and supported to the inn and then he saw her no more his heart seemed to go out of his bosom in search of her and leave nothing but a stone behind he hung over the taffrail like a dead thing a steady footfall slapped his ear he raised his white face and filmy eyes and saw lieutenant fitzroy marching to and fro like a sentinel keeping everybody away from the mourner with the steady resolute businesslike face of a man in whom sentiment is confined to action its phrases and its flourishes being literally terra incognita to the honest fellow staines staggered towards him holding out both hands and gasped out god bless you hide me somewheremust not be seen sogot duty to dopatientcant do it yetone hour to draw my breathoh my god my godone hour sir then do my duty if i dieas you would fitzroy tore him down into his own cabin shut him in and ran to the first lieutenant with a tear in his eye can i have a sentry sir sentry what for the doctorawfully cut up at leaving his wife got him in my cabin wants to have his cry to himself fancy a fellow crying at going to sea it is not that sir it is leaving his wife well is he the only man on board that has got a wife why no sir it is odd now i think of it perhaps he has only got that one curious creatures landsmen said the first lieutenant however you can stick a marine there and i say show the youngster the berths and let him choose as the doctors aground yes sir so fitzoy planted his marine and then went after lord tadcaster he had drawn up alongside his cousin captain hamilton the captain being an admirer of lady cicely was mighty civil to his little lordship and talked to him more than was his wont on the quarterdeck for though he had a good flow of conversation and dispensed with ceremony in his cabin he was apt to be rather short on deck however he told little tadcaster he was fortunate they had a good start and if the wind held might hope to be clear of the channel in twentyfour hours you will see eddystone lighthouse about four bells said he shall we go out of sight of land altogether inquired his lordship of course we shall and the sooner the better he then explained to the novice that the only danger to a good ship was from the land while tadcaster was digesting this paradox captain hamilton proceeded to descant on the beauties of blue water and its fine medicinal qualities which he said were particularly suited to young gentlemen with bilious stomachs but presently catching sight of lieutenant fitzroy standing apart but with the manner of a lieutenant not there by accident he stopped and said civilly but smartly well sir fitzroy came forward directly saluted and said he had orders from the first lieutenant to show lord tadcaster the berths his lordship must be good enough to choose because the doctorcouldnt why not brought to sirfor the presentbywell by grief brought to by grief who the deuce is grief no riddles on the quarterdeck if you please sir oh no sir i assure you he is awfully cut up and he is having his cry out in my cabin having his cry out why what for leaving his wife sir oh is that all well i dont wonder cried little tadcaster warmly she is oh so beautiful and a sudden blush oerspread his pasty cheeks why on earth didnt we bring her along with us here said he suddenly opening his eyes with astonishment at the childish omission why indeed said the captain comically and dived below attended by the welldisciplined laughter of lieutenant fitzroy who was too good an officer not to be amused at his captains jokes having acquitted himself of that dutyand it is a very difficult one sometimeshe took lord tadcaster to the maindeck and showed him two comfortable sleepingberths that had been screened off for him and dr staines one of these was fitted with a standing bedplace the other had a cot swung in it fitzroy offered him the choice but hinted that he himself preferred a cot no thank you says my lord mighty dryly all right said fitzroy cheerfully take the other then my lord his little lordship cocked his eye like a jackdaw and looked almost as cunning you see said he i have been reading up for this voyage oh indeed logarithms of course not what then why peter simpleto be sure ah ha said fitzroy with a chuckle that showed plainly he had some delicious reminiscences of youthful study in the same quarter the little lord chuckled too and put one finger on fitzroys shoulder and pointed at the cot with another tumble out the other side you knowslippery hitchescords cutdown you come flop in the middle of the night fitzroys eye flashed merriment but only for a moment his countenance fell the next lord bless you said he sorrowfully all that game is over now her majestys shipit is a church afloat the service is going to the devil as the old fogies say aint you sorry says the little lord cocking his eye again like the bird hereinbefore mentioned of course i am then ill take the standing bed all right i say you dont mind the doctor coming down with a run eh he is not ill i am he is paid to take care of me i am not paid to take care of him said the young lord sententiously i understand replied fitzroy dryly well every one for himself and providence for us allas the elephant said when he danced among the chickens here my lord was summoned to dine with the captain staines was not there but he had not forgotten his duty in the midst of his grief he had written a note to the captain hoping that a bereaved husband might not seem to desert his post if he hid for a few hours the sorrow he felt himself unable to control meantime he would be grateful if captain hamilton would give orders that lord tadcaster should eat no pastry and drink only six ounces of claret otherwise he should feel that he was indeed betraying his trust the captain was pleased and touched with this letter it recalled to him how his mother sobbed when she launched her little middy swelling with his first cocked hat and dirk there was champagne at dinner and little tadcaster began to pour out a tumbler hold on said captain hamilton you are not to drink that and he quietly removed the tumbler bring him six ounces of claret while they were weighing the claret with scientific precision tadcaster remonstrated and being told it was the doctors order he squeaked out confound him why did not he stay with his wife she is beautiful nor did he give it up without a struggle heres hospitality said he six ounces receiving no reply he inquired of the third lieutenant which was generally considered the greatest authority in a shipthe captain or the doctor the third lieutenant answered not but turned his head away and by violent exertion succeeded in not splitting ill answer that said hamilton politely the captain is the highest in his department and the doctor in his now doctor staines is strictly within his department and will be supported by me and my officers you are bilious and epileptical and all the rest of it and you are to be cured by diet and blue water tadcaster was inclined to snivel however he subdued that weakness with a visible effort and in due course returned to the charge how would you look quavered he if there was to be a mutiny in this ship of yours and i was to head it well i should look sharphang all the ringleaders at the yardarm clap the rest under hatches and steer for the nearest prison oh said tadcaster and digested this scheme a bit at last he perked up again and made his final hit well i shouldnt care for one if you didnt flog us in that case said captain hamilton id flog youand stop your six ounces then curse the sea that is all i say why you have not seen it you have only seen the british channel it was mr fitzroy who contributed this last observation after dinner all but the captain went on deck and saw the eddystone lighthouse ahead and to leeward they passed it fitzroy told his lordship its story and that of its unfortunate predecessors soon after this lord tadcaster turned in presently the captain observed a change in the thermometer which brought him on deck he scanned the water and the sky and as these experienced commanders have a subtle insight into the weather especially in familiar latitudes he remarked to the first lieutenant that it looked rather unsettled and as a matter of prudence ordered a reef in the topsails and the royal yards to be sent down ship to be steered w by s this done he turned in but told them to call him if there was any change in the weather during the night the wind gradually headed and at four bells in the middle watch a heavy squall came up from the southwest this brought the captain on deck again he found the officer of the watch at his post and at work sail was shortened and the ship made snug for heavy weather at four am it was blowing hard and being too near the french coast they wore the ship now this operation was bad for little tadcaster while the vessel was on the starboard tack the side kept him snug but when they wore her of course he had no leeboard to keep him in the ship gave a leelurch and shot him clean out of his bunk into the middle of the cabin he shrieked and shrieked with terror and pain till the captain and staines who were his nearest neighbors came to him and they gave him a little brandy and got him to bed again here he suffered nothing but violent seasickness for some hours as for staines he had been swinging heavily in his cot but such was his mental distress that he would have welcomed seasickness or any reasonable bodily suffering he was in that state when the sting of a wasp is a touch of comfort worn out with sickness tadcaster would not move invited to breakfast he swore faintly and insisted on dying in peace at last exhaustion gave him a sort of sleep in spite of the motion which was violent for it was now blowing great guns a heavy sea on and the great waves dirty in color and crested with raging foam they had to wear ship again always a ticklish manoeuvre in weather like this a tremendous sea struck her quarter stove in the very port abreast of which the little lord was lying and washed him clean out of bed into the lee scuppers and set all swimming around him didnt he yell and wash about the cabin and grab at all the chairs and tables and things that drifted about nimble as eels avoiding his grasp in rushed the captain and in staggered staines they stopped his voyage autour de sa chambre and dragged him into the after saloon he clung to them by turns and begged with many tears to be put on the nearest land a rock would do much obliged said the captain now is the very time to give rocks a wide berth a dead whale thena lighthouseanything but a beast of a ship they pacified him with a little brandy and for the next twentyfour hours he scarcely opened his mouth except for a purpose it is needless to dwell on we can trust to our terrestrial readers personal reminiscences of leelurches weatherrolls and their faithful concomitant at last they wriggled out of the channel and soon after that the wind abated and next day veered round to the northward and the ship sailed almost on an even keel the motion became as heavenly as it had been diabolical and the passengers came on deck staines had suffered one whole day from seasickness but never complained i believe it did his mind more good than harm as for tadcaster he continued to suffer at intervals for two days more but on the fifth day out he appeared with a little pink tinge on his cheek and a wolfish appetite dr staines controlled his diet severely as to quality and when they had been at sea just eleven days the physicians heavy heart was not a little lightened by the marvellous change in him the unthinking who believe in the drug system should have seen what a physician can do with air and food when circumstances enable him to enforce the diet he enjoins money will sometimes buy even health if you avoid drugs entirely and go another road little tadcaster went on board pasty dimeyed and very subject to fits because his stomach was constantly overloaded with indigestible trash and the blood in his brainvessels was always either galloping or creeping under the first or second effect of stimulants administered at first by thoughtless physicians behold him nowbronzed pinky brighteyed elastic and only one fit in twelve days the quarterdeck was hailed from the lookout with a cry that is sometimes terrible but in this latitude and weather welcome and exciting land ho where away cried the officer of the watch a point on the leebow sir it was the island of madeira they dropped anchor in funchal roads furled sails squared yards and fired a salute of twentyone guns for the portuguese flag they went ashore and found a good hotel and were no longer dosed as in former days with oil onions garlic eggs but the wine queer and no madeira to be got staines wrote home to his wife he told her how deeply he had felt the bereavement but did not dwell on that his object being to cheer her he told her it promised to be a rapid and wonderful cure and one that might very well give him a fresh start in london they need not be parted a whole year he thought he sent her a very long letter and also such extracts from his sea journal as he thought might please her after dinner they inspected the town and what struck them most was to find the streets paved with flagstones and most of the carts drawn by bullocks on sledges a man every now and then would run forward and drop a greasy cloth in front of the sledge to lubricate the way next day after breakfast they ordered horses these on inspection proved to be of excellent breed either from australia or americavery rough shod for the stony roads started for the grand canalpeeped down that mighty chasm which has the appearance of an immense mass having been blown out of the centre of the mountain they lunched under the great dragon tree near its brink then rode back admiring the bold mountain scenery next morning at dawn rode on horses up the hill to the convent admired the beautiful gardens on the way remained a short time then came down in handsleighslittle baskets slung on sledges guided by two natives these sledges run down the hill with surprising rapidity and the men guide them round corners by sticking out a foot to port or starboard embarked at am at the men having dined the ship was got under way for the cape of good hope and all sail made for a southerly course to get into the northeast trades the weather was now balmy and delightful and so genial that everybody lived on deck and could hardly be got to turn in to their cabins even for sleep dr staines became a favorite with the officers there is a great deal of science on board a modern ship of war and of course on some points staines a cambridge wrangler and a man of many sciences and books was an oracle on others he was quite behind but a ready and quick pupil he made up to the navigating officer and learned with his help to take observations in return he was always at any youngsters service in a trigonometrical problem and he amused the midshipmen and young lieutenants with analytical tests some of these were applicable to certain liquids dispensed by the paymaster under one of them the port wine assumed some very droll colors and appearances not proper to grapejuice one lovely night that the ship clove the dark sea into a blaze of phosphorescence and her wake streamed like a comets tail a waggish middy got a bucketful hoisted on deck and asked the doctor to analyze that he did not much like it but yielded to the general request and by dividing it into smaller vessels and dropping in various chemicals made rainbows and silvery flames and what not but he declined to repeat the experiment no no once is philosophy twice is cruelty ive slain more than samson already as for tadcaster science had no charms for him but fiction had and he got it galore for he cruised about the forecastle and there the quartermasters and old seamen spun him yarns that held him breathless but one day my lord had a fit on the quarterdeck and a bad one and staines found him smelling strong of rum he represented this to captain hamilton the captain caused strict inquiries to be made and it came out that my lord had gone among the men with money in both pockets and bought a little of one mans grog and a little of another and had been sipping the furtive but transient joys of solitary intoxication captain hamilton talked to him seriously told him it was suicide never mind old boy said the young monkey a short life and a merry one then hamilton represented that it was very ungentlemanlike to go and tempt poor jack with his money to offend discipline and get flogged how will you feel tadcaster when you see their backs bleeding under the cat oh dn it all george dont do that says the young gentleman all in a hurry then the commander saw he had touched the right chord so he played on it till he got lord tadcaster to pledge his honor not to do it again the little fellow gave the pledge but relieved his mind as follows but it is a cursed tyrannical hole this tiresome old ship you cant do what you like in it well but no more you can in the grave and that is the agreeable residence you were hurrying to but for this tiresome old ship lord no more you can said tadcaster with sudden candor i forgot that the airs were very light the ship hardly moved it was beginning to get dull when one day a sail was sighted on the weatherbow standing to the eastward on nearing her she was seen by the cut of her sails to be a manofwar evidently homeward bound so captain hamilton ordered the mainroyal to be lowered to render signal more visible and the demand hoisted no notice being taken of this a gun was fired to draw her attention to the signal this had the desired effect down went her mainroyal up went her number on referring to the signal book she proved to be the vindictive from the pacific station this being ascertained captain hamilton being that captains senior signalled close and prepare to receive letters in obedience to this she bore up ran down and rounded to the sail in the amphitrite was also shortened the maintopsail laid to the mast and a boat lowered the captain having finished his despatches they with the letterbags were handed into the boat which shoved off pulled to the lee side of the vindictive and left the despatches with captain hamiltons compliments on its return both ships made sail on their respective course exchanging bon voyage by signal and soon the upper sails of the homewardbounder were seen dipping below the horizon longing eyes followed her on board the amphitrite how many hurried missives had been written and despatched in that halfhour but as for staines he was a man of forethought and had a volume ready for his dear wife lord tadcaster wrote to lady cicely treherne his epistle though brief contained a plum or two he wrote what with sailing and fishing and eating nothing but roast meat im quite another man this amused her ladyship a little but not so much as the postscript which was indeed the neatest thing in its way she had met with and she had some experience too psi say cicely i think i should like to marry you would you mind let us defy time and space to give you lady cicelys reply i should enjoy it of all things taddy but alas i am too young nbshe was twentyseven and tad sixteen to be sure tad was four feet eleven and she was only five feet six and a half to return to my narrative with apologies this meeting of the vessels caused a very agreeable excitement that day but a greater was in store in the afternoon tadcaster staines and the principal officers of the ship being at dinner in the captains cabin in came the officer of the watch and reported a large spar on the weatherbow well close it if you can and let me know if it looks worth picking up he then explained to lord tadcaster that on a cruise he never liked to pass a spar or anything that might possibly reveal the fate of some vessel or other in the middle of his discourse the officer came in again but not in the same cool business way he ran in excitedly and said captain the signalman reports it alive alivea spar what do you mean something alive on it eh no sir alive itself how can that be hail him again ask him what it is the officer went out and hailed the signalman at the masthead what is it seasarpint i think this hail reached the captains ears faintly however he waited quietly till the officer came in and reported it then he burst out absurd there is no such creature in the universe what do you say dr stainesit is in your department the universe in my department captain haw haw haw went fitzroy and two more no you rogue the serpent dr staines thus appealed to asked the captain if he had ever seen small snakes out at sea why of course sailed through a mile of them once in the archipelago sure they were snakes quite sure and the biggest was not eight feet long very well captain then seaserpents exist and it becomes a mere question of size now which produces the larger animals in every kindland or sea the grown elephant weighs i believe about five tons the very smallest of the whale tribe weighs ten and they go as high as forty tons there are smaller fish than the whale that are four times as heavy as the elephant why doubt then that the sea can breed a snake to eclipse the boaconstrictor even if the creature had never been seen i should by mere reasoning from analogy expect the sea to produce a serpent excelling the boaconstrictor as the lobster excels a crayfish of our rivers see how large things grow at sea the salmon born in our rivers weighs in six months a quarter of a pound or less it goes out to sea and comes back in one year weighing seven pounds so far from doubting the large seaserpents i believe they exist by the million the only thing that puzzles me is why they should ever show a nose above water they must be very numerous i think captain hamilton laughed and said well this is new doctor in compliment to your opinion we will go on deck and inspect the reptile you think so common he stopped at the door and said doctor the saltcellar is by you would you mind bringing it on deck we shall want a little to secure the animal so they all went on deck right merrily the captain went up a few ratlines in the mizzen rigging and looked to windward laughing all the time but all of a sudden there was a great change in his manner good heavens it is aliveluff the helmsman obeyed the news spread like wildfire mess kids grog kids pipes were all let fall and some three hundred sailors clustered on the rigging like bees to view the longtalkedof monster it was soon discovered to be moving lazily along the propelling part being under water and about twentyfive feet visible it had a small head for so large a body and as they got nearer rough scales were seen ending in smaller ones further down the body it had a mane but not like a lions as some have pretended if you have ever seen a pony with a hogmane that was more the character of this creatures mane if mane it was they got within a hundred yards of it and all saw it plainly scarce believing their senses when they could get no nearer for the wind the captain yielded to that instinct which urges man always to kill a curiosity to encourage the rest as saith the witty voltaire get ready a gunbest shot in the ship lay and fire it this was soon done bang went the gun the shot struck the water close to the brute and may have struck him under water for aught i know any way it sorely disturbed him for he reared into the air a column of serpents flesh that looked as thick as the maintopmast of a seventyfour opened a mouth that looked capacious enough to swallow the largest buoy anchor in the ship and with a strange grating noise between a bark and a hiss dived and was seen no more when he was gone they all looked at one another like men awaking from a dream staines alone took it quite coolly it did not surprise him in the least he had always thought it incredible that the boaconstrictor should be larger than any seasnake that idea struck him as monstrous and absurd he noted the seaserpent in his journal but with this doubt semblemore like a very large eel next day they crossed the line just before noon a young gentleman burst into stainess cabin apologizing for want of ceremony but if dr staines would like to see the line it was now in sight from the mizzentop glad of it sir said staines collect it for me in the ships buckets if you please i want to send a line to friends at home young gentleman buried his hands in his pockets walked out in solemn silence and resumed his position on the leeside of the quarterdeck nevertheless this opening coupled with what he had heard and read made staines a little uneasy and he went to his friend fitzroy and said now look here i am at the service of you experienced and humorous mariners i plead guilty at once to the crime of never having passed the line so make ready your swabs and lather me your ships scraper and shave me and let us get it over but lord tadcaster is nervous sensitive prouder than he seems and im not going to have him driven into a fit for all the neptunes and amphitrites in creation fitzroy heard him out then burst out laughing why there is none of that game in the royal navy said he hasnt been this twenty years im so sorry said dr staines if theres a form of wit i revere it is practical joking doctor you are a satirical beggar staines told tadcaster and he went forward and chaffed his friend the quartermaster who was one of the forecastle wits i say quartermaster why doesnt neptune come on board dead silence i wonder what has become of poor old nep gone ashore growled the seaman last seen in rateliff highway got a shop therelends a shilling in the pound on seamens advance tickets oh and amphitrite married the sexton at wapping and the nereids neruds scratching his head i harnt kept my eye on them small craft but i believe they are selling oysters in the port of leith a light breeze carried them across the equator but soon after they got becalmed and it was dreary work and the ship rolled gently but continuously and upset lord tadcasters stomach again and quenched his manly spirit at last they were fortunate enough to catch the southeast trade but it was so languid at first that the ship barely moved through the water though they set every stitch and studding sails alow and aloft till really she was acres of canvas while she was so creeping along a man in the mizzentop noticed an enormous shark gliding steadily in her wake this may seem a small incident yet it ran through the ship like wildfire and caused more or less uneasiness in three hundred stout hearts so near is every seaman to death and so strong the persuasion in their superstitious minds that a shark does not follow a ship pertinaciously without a prophetic instinct of calamity unfortunately the quartermaster conveyed this idea to lord tadcaster and confirmed it by numerous examples to prove that there was always death at hand when a shark followed the ship thereupon tadcaster took it into his head that he was under a relapse and the shark was waiting for his dead body he got quite lowspirited staines told fitzroy fitzroy said shark be hanged ill have him on deck in half an hour he got leave from the captain a hook was baited with a large piece of pork and towed astern by a stout line experienced old hands attending to it by turns the shark came up leisurely surveyed the bait and i apprehend ascertained the position of the hook at all events he turned quietly on his back sucked the bait off and retired to enjoy it every officer in the ship tried him in turn but without success for if they got ready for him and the moment he took the bait jerked the rope hard in that case he opened his enormous mouth so wide that the bait and hook came out clear but sooner or later he always got the bait and left his captors the hook this went on for days and his huge dorsal fin always in the ships wake then tadcaster who had watched these experiments with hope lost his spirit and appetite staines reasoned with him but in vain somebody was to die and although there were three hundred and more in the ship he must be the one at last he actually made his will and threw himself into stainess arms and gave him messages to his mother and lady cicely and ended by frightening himself into a fit this roused stainess pity and also put him on his mettle what science be beaten by a shark he pondered the matter with all his might and at last an idea came to him he asked the captains permission to try his hand this was accorded immediately and the ships stores placed at his disposal very politely but with a sly comical grin dr staines got from the carpenter some sheets of zinc and spare copper and some flannel these he cut into threeinch squares and soaked the flannel in acidulated water he then procured a quantity of bellwire the greater part of which he insulated by wrapping it round with hot gutta percha so eager was he that he did not turn in all night in the morning he prepared what he called an electric fusehe filled a sodawater bottle with gunpowder attaching some cork to make it buoyant put in the fuse and bung made it watertight connected and insulated his main wiresenveloped the bottle in porktied a line to it and let the bottle overboard the captain and officers shook their heads mysteriously the tars peeped and grinned from every rope to see a doctor try and catch a shark with a sodawater bottle and no hook but somehow the doctor seemed to know what he was about so they hovered round and awaited the result mystified but curious and showing their teeth from ear to ear the only thing i fear said staines is that the moment he takes the bait he will cut the wire before i can complete the circuit and fire the fuse nevertheless there was another objection to the success of the experiment the shark had disappeared well said the captain at all events you have frightened him away no said little tadcaster white as a ghost he is only under water i know waitingwaiting there he is cried one in the ratlines there was a rush to the taffrailgreat excitement keep clear of me said staines quietly but firmly it can only be done at the moment before he cuts the wire the old shark swam slowly round the bait he saw it was something new he swam round and round it he wont take it said one he suspects something oh yes he will take the meat somehow and leave the pepper sly old fox he has eaten many a poor jack that one the shark turned slowly on his back and instead of grabbing at the bait seemed to draw it by gentle suction into that capacious throat ready to blow it out in a moment if it was not all right the moment the bait was drawn out of sight staines completed the circuit the bottle exploded with a fury that surprised him and everybody who saw it a ton of water flew into the air and came down in spray and a gory carcass floated belly uppermost visibly staining the blue water there was a roar of amazement and applause the carcass was towed alongside at tadcasters urgent request and then the power of the explosion was seen confined first by the bottle then by the meat then by the fish and lastly by the water it had exploded with tenfold power had blown the brutes head into a million atoms and had even torn a great furrow in its carcass exposing three feet of the backbone taddy gloated on his enemy and began to pick up again from that hour the wind improved and as usual in that latitude scarcely varied a point they had a pleasant timeprivate theatricals and other amusements till they got to latitude deg s and longitude deg w then the trade wind deserted them light and variable winds succeeded the master complained of the chronometers and the captain thought it his duty to verify or correct them and so shaped his course for the island of tristan dacunha then lying a little way out of his course i ought perhaps to explain to the general reader that the exact position of this island being long ago established and recorded it was an infallible guide to go by in verifying a ships chronometers next day the glass fell all day and the captain said he should doublereef topsails at nightfall for something was brewing the weather however was fine and the ship was sailing very fast when about half an hour before sunset the masthead man hailed that there was a bulk of timber in sight broad on the weatherbow the signalman was sent up and said it looked like a raft the captain who was on deck levelled his glass at it and made it out a raft with a sort of rail to it and the stump of a mast he ordered the officer of the watch to keep the ship as close to the wind as possible he should like to examine it if he could the master represented respectfully that it would be unadvisable to beat to windward for that i have no faith in our chronometers sir and it is important to make the island before dark fogs rise here so suddenly very well mr bolt then i suppose we must let the raft go man on the raft to windward hailed the signalman this electrified the ship the captain ran up the mizzen rigging and scanned the raft now nearly abeam it is a man he cried and was about to alter the ships course when at that moment the signalman hailed again it is a corpse how dye know by the gulls then succeeded an exciting dialogue between the captain and the master who being in his department was very firm and went so far as to say he would not answer for the safety of the ship if they did not sight the land before dark the captain said very well and took a turn or two but at last he said no her majestys ship must not pass a raft with a man on it dead or alive he then began to give the necessary orders but before they were all out of his mouth a fatal interruption occurred tadcaster ran into dr stainess cabin crying a raft with a corpse close by staines sprang to the quarter port to see and craning eagerly out the lower port chain which had not been well secured slipped the port gave way and as his whole weight rested on it canted him headlong into the sea a smart seaman in the forechains saw the accident and instantly roared out man overboard a cry that sends a thrill through a ships very ribs another smart fellow cut the lifebuoy adrift so quickly that it struck the water within ten yards of staines the officer of the watch without the interval of half a moment gave the right orders in the voice of a stentor let go lifebuoy lifeboats crew away hands shorten sail mainsel up main topsel to mast these orders were executed with admirable swiftness meantime there was a mighty rush of feet throughout the frigate every hatchway was crammed with men eager to force their way on deck in five seconds the middy of the watch and half her crew were in the lee cutter fitted with cliffords apparatus lower away cried the excited officer the others will come down by the pendants the man stationed sitting on the bottom boards eased away roundly when suddenly there was a hitchthe boat would go no farther lower away there in the cutter why dont you lower screamed the captain who had come over to leeward expecting to see the boat in the water the rope has swollen sir and the pendants wont unreeve cried the middy in agony volunteers for the weatherboat shouted the first lieutenant but the order was unnecessary for more than the proper number were in her already plug inlower away but mishaps never come singly scarcely had this boat gone a foot from the davit than the volunteer who was acting as coxswain in reaching out for something inadvertently let go the line which in kynastons apparatus keeps the tackles hooked consequently down went the boat and crew twenty feet with a terrific crash the men were struggling for their lives and the boat was stove but meantime more men having been sent into the lee cutter their weight caused the pendants to render and the boat got afloat and was soon employed picking up the struggling crew seeing this lieutenant fitzroy collected some hands and lowered the lifeboat gig which was fitted with common tackles got down into her himself by the falls and pulling round to windward shouted to the signalman for directions the signalman was at his post and had fixed his eye on the man overboard as his duty was but his messmate was in the stove boat and he had cast one anxious look down to see if he was saved and sad to relate in that one moment he had lost sight of staines the sudden darknessthere was no twilightconfused him more and the ship had increased her drift fitzroy however made a rapid calculation and pulled to windward with all his might he was followed in about a minute by the other sound boat powerfully manned and both boats melted away into the night there was a long and anxious suspense during which it became pitch dark and the ship burned blue lights to mark her position more plainly to the crews that were groping the sea for that beloved passenger captain hamilton had no doubt that the fate of staines was decided one way or other long before this but he kept quiet until he saw the plain signs of a squall at hand then as he was responsible for the safety of boats and ship he sent up rockets to recall them the cutter came alongside first lights were poured on her and quavering voices asked have you got him the answer was dead silence and sorrowful drooping heads sadly and reluctantly was the order given to hoist the boat in then the gig came alongside fitzroy seated in her with his hands before his face the men gloomy and sad gone gone soon the ship was battling a heavy squall at midnight all quiet again and hove to then at the request of many the bell was tolled and the ships company mustered bareheaded and many a stout seaman in tears as the last service was read for christopher staines chapter xiv rosa fell ill with grief at the hotel and could not move for some days but the moment she was strong enough she insisted on leaving plymouth like all wounded things she must drag herself home but what a home how empty it struck and she heartsick and desolate now all the familiar places wore a new aspect the little yard where he had so walked and waited became a temple to her and she came out and sat in it and now first felt to the full how much he had suffered therewith what fortitude she crept about the house and kissed the chair he had sat in and every muchused place and thing of the departed her shallow nature deepened and deepened under this bereavement of which she said to herself with a shudder she was the cause and this is the course of nature there is nothing like suffering to enlighten the giddy brain widen the narrow mind improve the trivial heart as her regrets were tender and deep so her vows of repentance were sincere oh what a wife she would make when he came back how thoughtful how prudent how loyal and never have a secret she who had once said what is the use of your writing nobody will publish it now collected and perused every written scrap with simple affection she even locked up his very wastepaper basket full of fragments he had torn or useless papers he had thrown there before he went to plymouth in the drawer of his writingtable she found his diary it was a thick quarto it began with their marriage and ended with his leaving homefor then he took another volume this diary became her bible she studied it daily till her tears hid his lines the entries were very miscellaneous very exact it was a map of their married life but what she studied most was his observations on her own character so scientific yet so kindly and his scholarlike and wise reflections the book was an unconscious picture of a great mind she had hitherto but glanced at now she saw it all plain before her saw it understood it adored it mourned it such women are shallow not for want of a head upon their shoulders but of attention they do not really study anything they have been taught at their schools the bad art of skimming but let their hearts compel their brains to think and think the result is considerable the deepest philosopher never fathomed a character more thoroughly than this poor child fathomed her philosopher when she had read his journal ten or eleven times and bedewed it with a thousand tears one passage almost cut her more intelligent heart in twain this dark day i have done a thing incredible i have spoken with brutal harshness to the innocent creature i have sworn to protect she had run in debt through inexperience and that unhappy timidity which makes women conceal an error till it ramifies by concealment into a fault and i must storm and rave at her till she actually fainted away brute ruffian monster and she how did she punish me poor lamb by soft and tender wordslike a lady as she is oh my sweet rosa i wish you could know how you are avenged talk of the scourgethe cat i would be thankful for two dozen lashes ah there is no need i think to punish a man who has been cruel to a woman let him alone he will punish himself more than you can if he is really a man from the date of that entry this selfreproach and selftorture kept cropping up every now and then in the diary and it appeared to have been not entirely without its influence in sending staines to sea though the main reason he gave was that his rosa might have the comforts and luxuries she had enjoyed before she married him one day while she was crying over this diary uncle philip called but not to comfort her i promise you he burst on her irate to take her to task he had returned learned christophers departure and settled the reason in his own mind that uxorious fool was gone to sea by a natural reaction his eyes were open to his wife at last and he was sick of her folly so he had fled to distant climes as who would not that could so maam said he my nephew is gone to sea i findall in a hurry pray may i ask what he has done that for it was a very simple question yet it did not elicit a very plain answer she only stared at this abrupt inquisitor and then cried piteously oh uncle philip and burst out sobbing why what is the matter you will hate me now he is gone to make money for me and i would rather have lived on a crust uncledont hate me im a poor bereaved heartbroken creature that repents repents heigho why what have you been up to now maam no great harm ill be bound flirting a little with some fooleh flirting me a married woman oh to be sure i forgot why surely he has not deserted you my christopher desert me he loves me too well far more than i deserve but not more than i will uncle philip i am too confused and wretched to tell you all that has happened but i know you love him though you had a tiff uncle he called on you to shake hands and ask your forgiveness poor fellow he was so sorry you were away please read his dear diary it will tell you all better than his poor foolish wife can i know it by heart ill show you where you and he quarrelled about me there see and she showed him the passage with her finger he never told me it was that or i would have come and begged your pardon on my knees but see how sorry he was there see and now ill show you another place where my christopher speaks of your many many acts of kindness there see and now please let me show you how he longed for reconciliation there see and it is the same through the book and now ill show you how grieved he was to go without your blessing i told him i was sure you would give him that and him going away ah me will he ever return uncle dear dont hate me what shall i do now he is gone if you disown me why you are the only staines left me to love disown you maam that ill never do you are a goodhearted young woman i find there run and dry your eyes and let me read christophers diary all through then i shall see how the land lies rosa complied with his proposal and left him alone while she bathed her eyes and tried to compose herself for she was all trembling at this sudden irruption when she returned to the drawingroom he was walking about looking grave and thoughtful it is the old story said he rather gently a misunderstanding how wise our ancestors were that first used that word to mean a quarrel for look into twenty quarrels and you shall detect a score of misunderstandings yet our american cousins must go and substitute the unideaed word difficulty that is wonderful i had no quarrel with him delighted to see either of you but i had called twice on him so i thought he ought to get over his temper and call on a tried friend like me a misunderstanding now my dear let us have no more of these misunderstandings you will always be welcome at my house and i shall often come here and look after you and your interests what do you mean to do i wonder sir i am to go home to my father if he will be troubled with me i have written to him and what is to become of the bijou my christie thought i should like to part with it and the furniturebut his own writingdesk and his chair no i never will and his little clock oh oh ohbut i remember what you said about agents and i dont know what to do for i shall be away then leave it to me ill come and live here with one servant and ill soon sell it for you you uncle philip well why not said he roughly that will be a great trouble and discomfort to you im afraid if i find it so ill soon drop it im not the fool to put myself out for anybody when you are ready to go out send me word and ill come in soon after this he bustled off he gave her a sort of hurried kiss at parting as if he was ashamed of it and wanted it over as quickly as possible next day her father came condoled with her politely assured her there was nothing to cry about husbands were a sort of functionaries that generally went to sea at some part of their career and no harm ever came of it on the contrary absence makes the heart grow fonder said this judicious parent this sentiment happened to be just a little too true and set the daughter crying bitterly but she fought against it oh no said she i mustnt i will not be always crying in kent villa lord forbid i shall get over it in timea little why of course you will but as to your coming to kent villa i am afraid you would not be very comfortable there you know i am superannuated only got my pension now i know that papa andwhy that is one of the reasons i have a good income now and i thought if we put our means together oh that is a very different thing you will want a carriage i suppose i have put mine down no carriage no horse no footman no luxury of any kind till my christie comes back i abhor dress i abhor expense i loathe everything i once liked too well i detest every folly that has parted us and i hate myself worst of all oh oh oh forgive me for crying so well i dare say there are associations about this place that upset you i shall go and make ready for you dear and then you can come as soon as you like he bestowed a paternal kiss on her brow and glided doucely away before she could possibly cry again the very next week rosa was at kent villa with the relics of her husband about her his chair his writingtable his clock his wastepaper basket a very deep and large one she had them all in her bedroom at kent villa here the days glided quietly but heavily she derived some comfort from uncle philip his rough friendly way was a tonic and braced her he called several times about the bijou told her he had put up enormous boards all over the house and puffed it finely i have had a hundred agents at me said he and the next thing i hope will be one customer that is about the proportion at last he wrote her he had hooked a victim and sold the lease and furniture for nine hundred guineas staines had assigned the lease to rosa so she had full powers and philip invested the money and two hundred more she gave him in a little mortgage at six per cent now came the letter from madeira it gave her new life christopher was well contented hopeful his example should animate her she would bravely bear the present and share his hopes of the future with these brighter views nature cooperated the instincts of approaching maternity brightened the future she fell into gentle reveries and saw her husband return and saw herself place their infant in his arms with all a wifes a mothers pride in due course came another long letter from the equator with a full journal and more words of hope home in less than a year with reputation increased by this last cure home to part no more ah what a changed wife he should find how frugal how candid how full of appreciation admiration and love of the noblest dearest husband that ever breathed lady cicely treherne waited some weeks to let kinder sentiments return she then called in dear street but found mrs staines was gone to gravesend she wrote to her in a few days she received a reply studiously polite and cold this persistent injustice mortified her at last she said to herself does she think his departure was no loss to me it was to her interests as well as his i sacrificed my own selfish wishes i will write to her no more this resolution she steadily maintained it was shaken for a moment when she heard by a side wind that mrs staines was fast approaching the great pain and peril of women then she wavered but no she prayed for her by name in the liturgy but she troubled her no more this state of things lasted some six weeks when she received a letter from her cousin tadcaster close on the heels of his last to which she had replied as i have indicated she knew his handwriting and opened it with a smile that smile soon died off her horrorstricken face the letter ran thus tristan dacunha jan dear cicelya terrible thing has just happened we signalled a raft with a body on it and poor dr staines leaned out of the porthole and fell overboard three boats were let down after him but it all went wrong somehow or it was too late they could never find him he was drowned and the funeral service was read for the poor fellow we are all sadly cut up everybody loved him it was dreadful next day at dinner when his chair was empty the very sailors cried at not finding him first of all i thought i ought to write to his wife i know where she lives it is called kent villa gravesend but i was afraid it might kill her and you are so good and sensible i thought i had better write to you and perhaps you could break it to her by degrees before it gets in all the papers i send this from the island by a small vessel and paid him ten pounds to take it your affectionate cousin tadcaster words are powerless to describe a blow like this the amazement the stupor the reluctance to believethe rising swelling surging horror she sat like a woman of stone crumpling the letter deaddead for a long time this was all her mind could realizethat christopher staines was dead he who had been so full of life and thought and genius and worthier to live than all the world was dead and a million nobodies were still alive and he was dead she lay back on the sofa and all the power left her limbs she could not move a hand but suddenly she started up for a noble instinct told her this blow must not fall on the wife as it had on her and in her time of peril she had her bonnet on in a moment and for the first time in her life darted out of the house without her maid she flew along the streets scarcely feeling the ground she got to dear street and obtained philip stainess address she flew to it and there learned he was down at kent villa instantly she telegraphed to her maid to come down to her at gravesend with things for a short visit and wait for her at the station and she went down by train to gravesend hitherto she had walked on air driven by one overpowering impulse now as she sat in the train she thought a little of herself what was before her to break to mrs staines that her husband was dead to tell her all her misgivings were more than justified to encounter her cold civility and let her know inch by inch it must be exchanged for curses and tearing of hair her husband was dead to tell her this and in the telling of it perhaps reveal that it was her great bereavement as well as the wifes for she had a deeper affection for him than she ought well she trembled like an aspen leaf trembled like one in an ague even as she sat but she persevered a noble woman has her courage not exactly the same as that which leads forlorn hopes against bastions bristling with rifles and tongued with flames and thunderbolts yet not inferior to it tadcaster small and dull but noble by birth and instinct had seen the right thing for her to do and she of the same breed and nobler far had seen it too and the great soul steadily drew the recoiling heart and quivering body to this fiery trial this act of humanityto do which was terrible and hard to shirk it cowardly and cruel she reached gravesend and drove in a fly to kent villa the door was opened by a maid is mrs staines at home yes maam she is at home but can i see her why no maam not at present but i must see her i am an old friend please take her my card lady cicely treherne the maid hesitated and looked confused perhaps you dont know maam mrs staines she isthe doctor have been in the house all day ah the doctor i believe dr philip staines is here why that is the doctor maam yes he is here then pray let me see himor no i had better see mr lusignan master have gone out for the day maam but if youll step in the drawingroom ill tell the doctor lady cicely waited in the drawingroom some time heartsick and trembling at last dr philip came in with her card in his hand looking evidently a little cross at the interruption now madam please tell me as briefly as you can what i can do for you are you dr philip staines i am madam at your servicefor five minutes cant quit my patient long just now oh sir thank god i have found you be prepared for ill newssad newsa terrible calamityi cant speak read that sir and she handed him tadcasters note he took it and read it he buried his face in his hands christopher my poor poor boy he groaned but suddenly a terrible anxiety seized him who knows of this he asked only myself sir i came here to break it to her you are a good kind lady for being so thoughtful madam if this gets to my nieces ears it will kill her as sure as we stand here then let us keep it from her command me sir i will do anything i will live heretake the letters inthe journalsanything no no you have done your part and god bless you for it you must not stay here your ladyships very presence and your agitation would set the servants talking and some idiotfiend among them babblingthere is nothing so terrible as a fool may i remain at the inn sir just one night oh yes i wish you would and i will run over if all is well with herwell with her poor unfortunate girl lady cicely saw he wished her gone and she went directly at nine oclock that same evening as she lay on a sofa in the best room of the inn attended by her maid dr philip staines came to her she dismissed her maid dr philip was too old in other words had lost too many friends to be really broken down by bereavement but he was strangely subdued the loud tones were out of him and the loud laugh and even the keen sneer yet he was the same man but with a gentler surface and this was not without its pathos well madam said he gravely and quietly it is as it always has been as is the race of leaves so that of man when one falls another comes heres a little christopher come in place of him that is gone a brave beautiful boy maam the finest but one i ever brought into the world he is come to take his fathers place in our heartsi see you valued his poor father maambut he comes too late for me at your age maam friendships come naturally they spring like loves in the soft heart of youth at seventy the gate is not so open the soil is more sterile i shall never care for another christopher never see another grow to mans estate the mother sir sobbed lady cicely the poor mother like them allpoor creature in heaven madam in heaven new life new existence a new character all the pride glory rapture and amazement of maternitythanks to her ignorance which we must prolong or i would not give one straw for her life or her sons i shall never leave the house till she does know it and come when it may i dread the hour she is not framed by nature to bear so deadly a shock her father sir would he not be the best person to break it to her he was out today her father maam i shall get no help from him he is one of those soft gentle creatures that come into the world with what your canting fools call a mission and his mission is to take care of number one not dishonestly mind you nor violently nor rudely but doucely and calmly the care a brute like me takes of his vitals that care lusignan takes of his outer cuticle his number one is a sensitive plant no scenes no noise nothing painfulbytheby the little creature that writes in the papers and calls calamities painful is of lusignans breed out today of course he was out maam he knew from me his daughter would be in peril all day so he visited a friend he knew his own tenderness and evaded paternal sensibilities a selfdefender i count on no help from that charming man a man i call such creachaas weptiles said lady cicely her ghastly cheek coloring for a moment then you give them a false importance in the course of this interview lady cicely accused herself sadly of having interfered between man and wife and with the best intentions brought about this cruel calamity judge then sir said she how grateful i am to you for undertaking this cruel task i was her schoolfellow sir and i love her dearly but she has turned against me and now oh with what horror she will regard me madam said the doctor there is nothing more mean and unjust than to judge others by events that none could foresee your conscience is clear you did your best for my poor nephew but fate willed it otherwise as for my niece she has many virtues but justice is one you must not look for in that quarter justice requires brains its a virtue the heart does not deal in you must be content with your own good conscience and an old mans esteem you did all for the best and this very day you have done a good kind action god bless you for it then he left her and next day she went sadly home and for many a long day the hollow world saw nothing of cicely treherne when mr lusignan came home that night dr philip told him the miserable story and his fears he received it not as philip had expected the bachelor had counted without his dormant paternity he was terrorstrickenabjectfell into a chair and wrung his hands and wept piteously to keep it from his daughter till she should be stronger seemed to him chimerical impossible however philip insisted it must be done and he must make some excuse for keeping out of her way or his manner would rouse her suspicions he consented readily to that and indeed left all to dr philip dr philip trusted nobody not even his own confidential servant he allowed no journal to come into the house without passing through his hands and he read them all before he would let any other soul in the house see them he asked rosa to let him be her secretary and open her letters giving as a pretext that it would be as well she should have no small worries or trouble just now why said she i was never so well able to bear them it must be a great thing to put me out now i am so happy and live in the future well dear uncle you can if you likewhat does it matteronly there must be one exception my own christies letters you know of course said he wincing inwardly the very next day came a letter of condolence from miss lucas dr philip intercepted it and locked it up to be shown her at a more fitting time but how could he hope to keep so public a thing as this from entering the house in one of a hundred newspapers he went into gravesend and searched all the newspapers to see what he had to contend with to his horror he found it in several dailies and weeklies and in two illustrated papers he sat aghast at the difficulty and the danger the best thing he could think of was to buy them all and cut out the account he did so and brought all the papers thus mutilated into the house and sent them into the kitchen he said to his old servant these may amuse mr lusignans people and i have extracted all that interests me by these means he hoped that none of the servants would go and buy more of these same papers elsewhere notwithstanding these precautions he took the nurse apart and said now you are an experienced woman and to be trusted about an excitable patient mind i object to any female servant entering mrs stainess room with gossip keep them outside the door for the present please oh and nurse if anything should happen likely to grieve or to worry her it must be kept from her entirely can i trust you you may sir i shall add ten guineas to your fee if she gets through the month without a shock or disturbance of any kind she stared at him inquiringly then she said you may rely on me doctor i feel i may still she alarms me she looks quiet enough but she is very excitable not all these precautions gave dr philip any real sense of security still less did they to mr lusignan he was not a tender father in small things but the idea of actual danger to his only child was terrible to him and he now passed his life in a continual tremble this is the less to be wondered at when i tell you that even the stout philip began to lose his nerve his appetite his sleep under this hourly terror and this hourly torture well did the great imagination of antiquity feign a torment too great for the mind long to endure in the sword of damocles suspended by a single hair over his head here the sword hung over an innocent creature who smiled beneath it fearless but these two old men must sit and watch the sword and ask themselves how long before that subtle salvation shall snap ill news travels fast says the proverb the birds of the air shall carry the matter says holy writ and it is so no bolts nor bars no promises nor precautions can long shut out a great calamity from the ears it is to blast the heart it is to wither the very air seems full of it until it falls rosas child was more than a fortnight old and she was looking more beautiful than ever as is often the case with a very young mother and dr philip complimented her on her looks now said he you reap the advantage of being good and obedient and keeping quiet in another ten days or so i may take you to the seaside for a week i have the honor to inform you that from about the fourth to the tenth of march there is always a week of fine weather which takes everybody by surprise except me it does not astonish me because i observe it is invariable now what would you say if i gave you a week at herne bay to set you up altogether as you please dear uncle said mrs staines with a sweet smile i shall be very happy to go or to stay i shall be happy everywhere with my darling boy and the thought of my husband why i count the days till he shall come back to me no to us to us my pet how dare a naughty mammy say to me as if me was half the portance of oo a precious pets dr philip was surprised into a sigh what is the matter dear said rosa very quickly the matter yes dear the matter you sighed you the laughing philosopher did i said he to gain time perhaps i remembered the uncertainty of human life and of all mortal hopes the old will have their thoughts my dear they have seen so much trouble but uncle dear he is a very healthy child very and you told me yourself carelessness was the cause so many children die that is true she gave him a curious and rather searching look then leaning over her boy said mammys not afraid beautiful pet was not born to die directly he will never leave his mamma no uncle he never can for my life is bound in his and his dear fathers it is a triple cord one go go all she said this with a quiet resolution that chilled uncle philip at this moment the nurse who had been bending so pertinaciously over some work that her eyes were invisible looked quickly up cast a furtive glance at mrs staines and finding she was employed for the moment made an agitated signal to dr philip all she did was to clench her two hands and lift them half way to her face and then cast a frightened look towards the door but philips senses were so sharpened by constant alarm and watching that he saw at once something serious was the matter but as he had asked himself what he should do in case of some sudden alarm he merely gave a nod of intelligence to the nurse scarcely perceptible then rose quietly from his seat and went to the window snow coming i think said he for all that we shall have the march summer in ten days you mark my words he then went leisurely out of the room at the door he turned and with all the cunning he was master of said oh by the by come to my room nurse when you are at leisure yes doctor said the nurse but never moved she was too bent on hiding the agitation she really felt had you not better go to him nurse perhaps i had madam she rose with feigned indifference and left the room she walked leisurely down the passage then casting a hasty glance behind her for fear mrs staines should be watching her hurried into the doctors room they met at once in the middle of the room and mrs briscoe burst out sir it is known all over the house heaven forbid what is known what you would give the world to keep from her why sir the moment you cautioned me of course i saw there was trouble but little i thoughtsir not a servant in the kitchen or the stable but knows that her husbandpoor thing poor thingah there goes the housemaidto have a look at her stop her mrs briscoe had not waited for this she rushed after the woman and told her mrs staines was sleeping and the room must not be entered on any account oh very well said the maid rather sullenly mrs briscoe saw her return to the kitchen and came back to dr staines he was pacing the room in torments of anxiety doctor said she it is the old story servants friends the masters enemies an old servant came here to gossip with her friend the cook she never could abide her while they were together by all accounts and told her the whole story of his being drowned at sea dr philip groaned cursed chatterbox said he what is to be done must we break it to her now oh if i could only buy a few days more the heart to be crushed while the body is weak it is too cruel advise me mrs briscoe you are an experienced woman and i think you are a kindhearted woman well sir said mrs briscoe i had the name of it when i was youngerbefore briscoe failed and i took to nursing which it hardens sir by use and along of the patients themselves for sick folk are lumps of selfishness we see more of them than you do sir but this i will say tisnt selfishness that lies now in that room waiting for the blow that will bring her to deaths door im sore afraid but a sweet gentle thoughtful creature as ever supped sorrow for i dont know how tis doctor nor why tis but an angel like that has always to sup sorrow but you do not advise me said the doctor in agitation and something must be done advise you sir it is not for me to do that i am sure im at my wits ends poor thing well sir i dont see what you can do but try and break it to her better so than let it come to her like a clap of thunder but i think sir id have a wetnurse ready before i said much for she is very quickand ten to one but the first word of such a thing turns her blood to gall sir i once knew a poor womanshe was a carpenters wifeanursing her child in the afternoonand in runs a foolish woman and tells her he was killed dead off a scaffold twas the mans sister told her well sir she was knocked stupid like and she sat staring and nursing of her child before she could take it in rightly the child was dead before suppertime and the woman was not long after the whole family was swept away sir in a few hours and i mind the table was not cleared he had dined on when they came to lay them out welladay nurses see sorrow we all see sorrow that live long mrs briscoe i am heartbroken myself i am desperate you are a good soul and ill tell you when my nephew married this poor girl i was very angry with him and i soon found she was not fit to be a struggling mans wife and then i was very angry with her she had spoiled a firstrate physician i thought but since i knew her better it is all changed she is so lovable how i shall ever tell her this terrible thing god knows all i know is that i will not throw a chance away her body shall be stronger before i break her heart cursed idiots that could not save a single man with their boats in a calm sea lord forgive me for blaming people when i was not there to see i say i will give her every chance she shall not know it till she is stronger no not if i live at her door and sleep there and all good god inspire me with something there is always something to be done if one could but see it mrs briscoe sighed and said sir i think anything is better than for her to hear it from a servantand they are sure to blurt it out young women are such fools no no i see what it is said dr philip i have gone all wrong from the first i have been acting like a woman when i should have acted like a man why i only trusted you by halves there was a fool for you never trust people by halves that is true sir well then now i shall go at it like a man i have a vile opinion of servants but no matter ill try them they are human i suppose ill hit them between the eyes like a man go to the kitchen mrs briscoe and tell them i wish to speak to all the servants indoors or out yes sir she stopped at the door and said i had better get back to her as soon as i have told them certainly and what shall i tell her sir her first word will be to ask me what you wanted me for i saw that in her eye she was curious that is why she sent me after you so quick dr philip groaned he felt he was walking among pitfalls he rapidly flavored some distilled water with orangeflower then tinted it a beautiful pink and bottled it there said he i was mixing a new medicine tablespoon four times a day had to filter it any lie you like mrs briscoe went to the kitchen and gave her message then went to mrs staines with the mixture dr philip went down to the kitchen and spoke to the servants very solemnly he said my good friends i am come to ask your help in a matter of life and death there is a poor young woman upstairs she is a widow and does not know it and must not know it yet if the blow fell now i think it would kill her indeed if she hears it all of a sudden at any time that might destroy her we are in so sore a strait that a feather may turn the scale so we must try all we can to gain a little time and then trust to gods mercy after all well now what do you say will you help me keep it from her till the tenth of march say and then i will break it to her by degrees forget she is your mistress master and servant that is all very well at a proper time but this is the time to remember nothing but that we are all one flesh and blood we lie down together in the churchyard and we hope to rise together where there will be no master and servant think of the poor unfortunate creature as your own flesh and blood and tell me will you help me try and save her under this terrible blow ay doctor that we will said the footman only you give us our orders and you will see i have no right to give you orders but i entreat you not to show her by word or look that calamity is upon her alas it is only a reprieve you can give her and to me the bitter hour must come when i must tell her she is a widow and her boy an orphan when that day comes i will ask you all to pray for me that i may find words but now i ask you to give me that ten days reprieve let the poor creature recover a little strength before the thunderbolt of affliction falls on her head will you promise me they promised heartily and more than one of the women began to cry a general assent will not satisfy me said dr philip i want every man and every woman to give me a hand upon it then i shall feel sure of you the men gave him their hands at once the women wiped their hands with their aprons to make sure they were clean and gave him their hands too the cook said if any one of us goes from it this kitchen will be too hot to hold her nobody will go from it cook said the doctor im not afraid of that and now since you have promised me out of your own good hearts ill try and be even with you if she knows nothing of it by the tenth of march five guineas to every man and woman in this kitchen you shall see that if you can be kind we can be grateful he then hurried away he found mr lusignan in the drawingroom and told him all this lusignan was fluttered but grateful ah my good friend said he this is a hard trial to two old men like you and me it is said philip it has shown me my age i declare i am trembling i whose nerves were iron but i have a particular contempt for servants mercenary wretches i think heaven inspired me to talk to them after all who knows perhaps we might find a way to their hearts if we did not eternally shock their vanity and forget that it is and must be far greater than our own the women gave me their tears and the men were earnest not one hand lay cold in mine as for your kitchenmaid id trust my life to that girl what a grip she gave me what strength what fidelity was in it my hand was never grasped before i think we are safe for a few days more lusignan sighed what does it all come to we are pulling the trigger gently that is all no no that is not it dont let us confound the matter with similes please keep them for children mrs staines left her bed and would have left her room but dr philip forbade it strictly one day seated in her armchair she said to the nurse before dr philip nurse why do the servants look so curiously at me mrs briscoe cast a hasty glance at dr philip and then said i dont know madam i never noticed that uncle why did nurse look at you before she answered such a simple question i dont know what question about the servants oh about the servants said he contemptuously you should not turn up your nose at them for they are all most kind and attentive only i catch them looking at me so strangely reallyas if they rosa you are taking me quite out of my depth the looks of servant girls why of course a lady in your condition is an object of especial interest to them i dare say they are saying to one another i wonder when my turn will come a fellowfeeling makes us wondrous kindthat is a proverb is it not to be sure i forgot that she said no more but seemed thoughtful and not quite satisfied on this dr philip begged the maids to go near her as little as possible you are not aware of it said he but your looks and your manner of speaking rouse her attention and she is quicker than i thought she was and observes very subtly this was done and then she complained that nobody came near her she insisted on coming downstairs it was so dull dr philip consented if she would be content to receive no visits for a week she assented to that and now passed some hours every day in the drawingroom in her morning wrappers so fresh and crisp she looked lovely and increased in health and strength every day dr philip used to look at her and his very flesh would creep at the thought that ere long he must hurl this fair creature into the dust of affliction must with a word take the ruby from her lips the rose from her cheeks the sparkle from her glorious eyeseyes that beamed on him with sweet affection and a mouth that never opened but to show some simplicity of mind or some pretty burst of the sensitive heart he put off and put off and at last cowardice began to whisper why tell her the whole truth at all why not take her through stages of doubt alarm and after all leave a grain of hope till her child gets so rooted in her heart thatbut conscience and good sense interrupted this temporary thought and made him see to what a horrible life of suspense he should condemn a human creature and live a perpetual lie and be always at the edge of some pitfall or other one day while he sat looking at her with all these thoughts and many more coursing through his mind she looked up at him and surprised him ah said she gravely what is the matter my dear oh nothing said she cunningly uncle dear said she presently when do we go to herne bay now dr philip had given that up he had got the servants at kent villa on his side and he felt safer here than in any strange place so he said i dont know that all depends there is plenty of time no uncle said rosa gravely i wish to leave this house i can hardly breathe in it what your native air mystery is not my native air and this house is full of mystery voices whisper at my door and the people dont come in the maids cast strange looks at me and hurry away i scolded that pert girl jane and she answered me as meek as moses i catch you looking at me with love and something else what is that something it is pity that is what it is do you think because i am called a simpleton that i have no eyes nor ears nor sense what is this secret which you are all hiding from one person and that is me ah christopher has not written these five weeks tell me the truth for i will know it and she started up in wild excitement then dr philip saw the hour was come he said my poor girl you have read us right i am anxious about christopher and all the servants know it anxious and not tell me his wife the woman whose life is bound up in his was it for us to retard your convalescence and set you fretting and perhaps destroy your child rosa my darling think what a treasure heaven has sent you to love and care for yes said she trembling heaven has been good to me i hope heaven will always be as good to me i dont deserve it but then i tell god so i am very grateful and very penitent i never forget that if i had been a good wife my husbandfive weeks is a long time why do you tremble so why are you so palea strong man like you calamity calamity dr philip hung his head she looked at him started wildly up then sank back into her chair so the stricken deer leaps then falls yet even now she put on a deceitful calm and said tell me the truth i have a right to know he stammered out there is a report of an accident at sea she kept silence of a passenger drownedout of that ship this coupled with his silence fills our hearts with fear it is worseyou are breaking it to meyou have gone too far to stop one word is he alive oh say he is alive philip rang the bell hard and said in a troubled voice rosa think of your child not when my husbandis he alive or dead it is hard to say with such a terrible report about and no letters faltered the old man his courage failing him what are you afraid of do you think i cant die and go to him alive or dead and she stood before him raging and quivering in every limb the nurse came in fetch her child he cried god have mercy on her ah then he is dead said she with stony calmness i drove him to sea and he is dead the nurse rushed in and held the child to her she would not look at it dead yes our poor christie is gonebut his child is herethe image of him do not forget the mother have pity on his child and yours take it out of my sight she screamed away with it or i shall murder it as i have murdered its father my dear christie before all that live i have killed him i shall die for him i shall go to him she raved and tore her hair servants rushed in rosa was carried to her bed screaming and raving and her black hair all down on both sides a piteous sight swoon followed swoon and that very night brain fever set in with all its sad accompaniments a poor bereaved creature tossing and moaning pale anxious but resolute faces of the nurse and the kitchenmaid watching on one table a pail of ice and on another the long thick raven hair of our poor simpleton lying on clean silver paper dr philip had cut it all off with his own hand and he was now folding it up and crying over it for he thought to himself perhaps in a few days more only this will be left of her on earth chapter xv staines fell headforemost into the sea with a heavy plunge being an excellent swimmer he struck out the moment he touched the water and that arrested his dive and brought him up with a slant shocked and panting drenched and confused the next moment he saw as through a foghis eyes being full of watersomething fall from the ship he breasted the big waves and swam towards it it rose on the top of a wave and he saw it was a lifebuoy encumbered with wet clothes he seemed impotent in the big waves they threw him up so high and down so low almost exhausted he got to the lifebuoy and clutched it with a fierce grasp and a wild cry of delight he got it over his head and placing his arms round the buoyant circle stood with his breast and head out of water gasping he now drew a long breath and got his wet hair out of his eyes already smarting with salt water and raising himself on the buoy looked out for help he saw to his great concern the ship already at a distance she seemed to have flown and she was still drifting fast away from him he saw no signs of help his heart began to turn as cold as his drenched body a horrible fear crossed him but presently he saw the weatherboat filled and fall into the water and then a wave rolled between him and the ship and he only saw her topmast the next time he rose on a mighty wave he saw the boats together astern of the vessel but not coming his way and the gloom was thickening the ship becoming indistinct and all was doubt and horror a life of agony passed in a few minutes he rose and fell like a cork on the buoyant wavesrose and fell and saw nothing but the ships lights now terribly distant but at last as he rose and fell he caught a few fitful glimpses of a smaller light rising and falling like himself a boat he cried and raising himself as high as he could shouted cried implored for help he stretched his hands across the water this way this way the light kept moving but it came no nearer they had greatly underrated the drift the other boat had no light minutes passed of suspense hope doubt dismay terror those minutes seemed hours in the agony of suspense the quaking heart sent beads of sweat to the brow though the body was immersed and the gloom deepened and the cold waves flung him up to heaven with their giant arms and then down again to hell and still that light his only hope was several hundred yards from him only for a moment at a time could his eyeballs straining with agony catch this willothewisp the boats light it groped the sea up and down but came no near when what seemed days of agony had passed suddenly a rocket rose in the horizonso it seemed to him the lost man gave a shriek of joy so prone are we to interpret things hopefully misery the next time he saw that little light that solitary spark of hope it was not quite so near as before a mortal sickness fell on his heart the ship had recalled the boats by rocket he shrieked he cried he screamed he raved oh rosa rosa for her sake men men do not leave me i am here here in vain the miserable man saw the boats little light retire recede and melt into the ships larger light and that light glided away then a cold deadly stupor fell on him then deaths icy claw seized his heart and seemed to run from it to every part of him he was a dead man only a question of time nothing to gain by floating but the despairing mind could not quit the world in peace and even here in the cold cruel sea the quivering body clung to this fragment of life and winced at deaths touch though more merciful he despised this weakness he raged at it he could not overcome it unable to live or to die condemned to float slowly hour by hour down into deaths jaws to a long deathlike stupor succeeded frenzy fury seized this great and longsuffering mind it rose against the cruelty and injustice of his fate he cursed the world whose stupidity had driven him to sea he cursed remorseless nature and at last he railed on the god who made him and made the cruel water that was waiting for his body gods justice gods mercy gods power they are all lies he shouted dreams chimeras like him the allpowerful and good men babble of by the fire if there was a god more powerful than the sea and only half as good as men are he would pity my poor rosa and me and send a hurricane to drive those caitiffs back to the wretch they have abandoned nature alone is mighty oh if i could have her on my side and only god against me but she is as deaf to prayer as he is as mechanical and remorseless i am a bubble melting into the sea soul i have none my body will soon be nothing nothing so ends an honest loving life i always tried to love my fellowcreatures curse them curse them curse the earth curse the sea curse all nature there is no other god for me to curse the moon came out he raised his head and staring eyeballs and cursed her the wind began to whistle and flung spray in his face he raised his fallen head and staring eyeballs and cursed the wind while he was thus raving he became sensible of a black object to windward it looked like a rail and a man leaning on it he stared he cleared the wet hair from his eyes and stared again the thing being larger than himself and partly out of water was drifting to leeward faster than himself he stared and trembled and at last it came nearly abreast black black he gave a loud cry and tried to swim towards it but encumbered with his lifebuoy he made little progress the thing drifted abreast of him but ten yards distant as they each rose high upon the waves he saw it plainly it was the very raft that had been the innocent cause of his sad fate he shouted with hope he swam he struggled he got near it but not to it it drifted past and he lost his chance of intercepting it he struggled after it the lifebuoy would not let him catch it then he gave a cry of agony rage despair and flung off the lifebuoy and risked all on this one chance he gains a little on the raft he loses he gains he cries rosa rosa and struggles with all his soul as well as his body he gains but when almost within reach a wave half drowns him and he loses he cries rosa rosa and swims high and strong rosa rosa rosa he is near it he cries rosa rosa and with all the energy of love and life flings himself almost out of the water and catches hold of the nearest thing on the raft it was the dead mans leg it seemed as if it would come away in his grasp he dared not try to pull himself up by that but he held on by it panting exhausting faint this faintness terrified him oh thought he if i faint now all is over holding by that terrible and strange support he made a grasp and caught hold of the woodwork at the bottom of the rail he tried to draw himself up impossible he was no better off than with his lifebuoy but in situations so dreadful men think fast he worked gradually round the bottom of the raft by his hands till he got to leeward still holding on there he found a solid block of wood at the edge of the raft he prised himself carefully up the raft in that part then sank a little he got his knee upon the timber of the raft and with a wild cry seized the nearest upright and threw both arms round it and clung tight then first he found breath to speak thank god he cried kneeling on the timber and grasping the upright postoh thank god thank god chapter xvi thank god why according to his theory it should have been thank nature but i observe that in such cases even philosophers are ungrateful to the mistress they worship our philosopher not only thanked god but being on his knees prayed forgiveness for his late ravings prayed hard with one arm curled round the upright lest the sea which ever and anon rushed over the bottom of the raft should swallow him up in a moment then he rose carefully and wedged himself into the corner of the raft opposite to that other figure ominous relic of the wild voyage the newcomer had entered upon he put both arms over the rail and stood erect the moon was now up but so was the breeze fleecy clouds flew with vast rapidity across her bright face and it was by fitful though vivid glances staines examined the raft and his companion the raft was large and well made of timbers tied and nailed together and a strong rail ran round it resting on several uprights there were also some blocks of a very light wood screwed to the horizontal timbers and these made it float high but what arrested and fascinated the mans gaze was his dead companion sole survivor doubtless of a horrible voyage since the raft was not made for one nor by one it was a skeleton or nearly whose clothes the seabirds had torn and pecked every limb in all the fleshy parts the rest of the body had dried to dark leather on the bones the head was little more than an eyeless skull but in the fitful moonlight those huge hollow caverns seemed gigantic lamplike eyes and glared at him fiendishly appallingly he sickened at the sight he tried not to look at it but it would be looked at and threaten him in the moonlight with great lacklustre eyes the wind whistled and lashed his face with spray torn off the big waves and the water was nearly up to his knees and the raft tossed so wildly it was all he could do to hold on in his corner in which struggle still those monstrous lacklustre eyes like lamps of death glared at him in the moon all else was dark except the fiery crests of the black mountainbillows tumbling and raging all around what a night but before morning the breeze sank the moon set and a sombre quiet succeeded with only that grim figure in outline dimly visible owing to the motion still retained by the waves it seemed to nod and rear and be ever preparing to rush upon him the sun rose glorious on a lovely scene the sky was a very mosaic of colors sweet and vivid and the tranquil rippling sea peachcolored to the horizon with lines of diamonds where the myriad ripples broke into smiles staines was asleep exhausted soon the light awoke him and he looked up what an incongruous picture met his eye that heaven of color all above and around and right before him like a devil stuck in midheaven that grinning corpse whose fate foreshadowed his own but daylight is a great strengthener of the nerves the figure no longer appalled hima man who had long learned to look with sciences calm eye upon the dead when the sea became like glass and from peachcolor deepened to rose he walked along the raft and inspected the dead man he found it was a man of color but not a black the body was not kept in its place as he had supposed merely by being jammed into the angle caused by the rail it was also lashed to the corner upright by a long stout belt staines concluded this had kept the body there and its companions had been swept away this was not lost on him he removed the belt for his own use he then found it was not only a belt but a receptacle it was nearly full of small hard substances that felt like stones when he had taken it off the body he felt a compunction ought he to rob the dead and expose it to be swept into the sea at the first wave like a dead dog he was about to replace the belt when a middle course occurred to him he was a man who always carried certain useful little things about him viz needles thread scissors and string he took a piece of string and easily secured this poor light skeleton to the raft the belt he strapped to the rail and kept for his own need and now hunger gnawed him no food was near there was nothing but the lovely sea and sky mosaic with color and that grim ominous skeleton hunger comes and goes many times before it becomes insupportable all that day and night and the next day he suffered its pangs and then it became torture but the thirst maddening towards night fell a gentle rain he spread a handkerchief and caught it he sucked the handkerchief this revived him and even allayed in some degree the pangs of hunger next day was cloudless a hot sun glared on his unprotected head and battered down his enfeebled frame he resisted as well as he could he often dipped his head and as often the persistent sun with cruel glare made it smoke again next day the same but the strength to meet it was waning he lay down and thought of rosa and wept bitterly he took the dead mans belt and lashed himself to the upright that act and his tears for his beloved were almost his last acts of perfect reason for next day came the delusions and the dreams that succeed when hunger ceases to torture and the vital powers begin to ebb he lay and saw pleasant meadows with meandering streams and clusters of rich fruit that courted the hand and melted in the mouth ever and anon they vanished and he saw grim death looking down on him with those big cavernous eyes by and by whether his bodys eye saw the grim skeleton or his minds eye the juicy fruits green meadows and pearly brooks all was shadowy so in a placid calm beneath a blue sky the raft drifted dead with its dead freight upon the glassy purple and he drifted too towards the world unknown there came across the waters to that dismal raft a thing none too common by sea or landa good man he was tall stalwart bronzed and had hair like snow before his time for he had known trouble he commanded a merchant steamer bound for calcutta on the old route the man at the masthead descried a floating wreck and hailed the deck accordingly the captain altered his course without one moments hesitation and brought up alongside lowered a boat and brought the dead and the breathing man on board a young middy lifted staines in his arms from the wreck to the boat he whose person i described in chapter one weighed now no more than that men are not always rougher than women their strength and nerve enable them now and then to be gentler than butteryfingered angels who drop frail things through sensitive agitation and break them these rough men saw staines was hovering between life and death and they handled him like a thing the ebbing life might be shaken out of in a moment it was pretty to see how gingerly the sailors carried the sinking man up the ladder and one fetched swabs and the others laid him down softly on them at their captains feet well done men said he poor fellow pray heaven we may not have come too late now stand aloof a bit send the surgeon aft the surgeon came and looked and felt the heart he shook his head and called for brandy he had stainess head raised and got half a spoonful of diluted brandy down his throat but there was an ominous gurgling after several such attempts at intervals he said plainly the mans life could not be saved by ordinary means then try extraordinary said the captain my orders are that he is to be saved there is life in him you have only got to keep it there he must be saved he shall be saved i should like to try dr stainess remedy said the surgeon try it then what is it a bath of beeftea dr staines says he applied it to a starved childin the lancet take a hundredweight of beef and boil it in the coppers thus encouraged the surgeon went to the cook and very soon beef was steaming on a scale and at a rate unparalleled meantime captain dodd had the patient taken to his own cabin and he and his servant administered weak brandy and water with great caution and skill there was no perceptible result but at all events there was life and vital instinct left or he could not have swallowed thus they hovered about him for some hours and then the bath was ready the captain took charge of the patients clothes the surgeon and a sailor bathed him in lukewarm beeftea and then covered him very warm with blankets next the skin guess how near a thing it seemed to them when i tell you they dared not rub him just before sunset his pulse became perceptible the surgeon administered half a spoonful of eggflip the patient swallowed it by and by he sighed he must not be left day or night said the captain i dont know who or what he is but he is a man and i could not bear him to die now that night captain dodd overhauled the patients clothes and looked for marks on his linen there were none poor devil said captain dodd he is a bachelor captain dodd found his pocketbook with banknotes two hundred pounds he took the numbers made a memorandum of them and locked the notes up he lighted his lamp examined the belt unripped it and poured out the contents on his table they were dazzling a great many large pieces of amethyst and some of white topaz and rock crystal a large number of smaller stones carbuncles chrysolites and not a few emeralds dodd looked at them with pleasure sparkling in the lamplight what a lot said he i wonder what they are worth he sent for the first mate who he knew did a little private business in precious stones masterton said he oblige me by counting these stones with me and valuing them mr masterton stared and his mouth watered however he named the various stones and valued them he said there was one stone a large emerald without a flaw that was worth a heavy sum by itself and the pearls very fine and looking at the great number they must be worth a thousand pounds captain dodd then entered the whole business carefully in the ships log the living man he described thus about five feet six in height and about fifty years of age then he described the notes and the stones very exactly and made masterton the valuer sign the log staines took a good deal of eggflip that night and next day ate solid food but they questioned him in vain his reason was entirely in abeyance he had become an eater and nothing else whenever they gave him food he showed a sort of fawning animal gratitude other sentiment he had none nor did words enter his mind any more than a birds and since it is not pleasant to dwell on the wreck of a fine understanding i will only say that they landed him at cape town out of bodily danger but weak and his mind to all appearance a hopeless blank they buried the skeletonread the service of the english church over a malabar heathen dodd took staines to the hospital and left twenty pounds with the governor of it to cure him but he deposited stainess money and jewels with a friendly banker and begged that the principal cashier might see the man and be able to recognize him should he apply for his own the cashier came and examined him and also the ruby ring on his fingera parting gift from rosaand remarked this was a new way of doing business why it is the only one sir said dodd how can we give you his signature he is not in his right mind nor never will be dont say that sir let us hope for the best poor fellow having made these provisions the worthy captain weighed anchor with a warm heart and a good conscience yet the image of the man he had saved pursued him and he resolved to look after him next time he should coal at cape town homeward bound staines recovered his strength in about two months but his mind returned in fragments and very slowly for a long long time he remembered nothing that had preceded his great calamity his mind started afresh aided only by certain fixed habits for instance he could read and write but strange as it may appear he had no idea who he was and when his memory cleared a little on that head he thought his surname was christie but he was not sure nevertheless the presiding physician discovered in him a certain progress of intelligence which gave him great hopes in the fifth month having shown a marked interest in the other sick patients coupled with a disposition to be careful and attentive they made him a nurse or rather a subnurse under the special orders of a responsible nurse i really believe it was done at first to avoid the alternative of sending him adrift or transferring him to the insane ward of the hospital in this congenial pursuit he showed such watchfulness and skill that by and by they found they had got a treasure two months after that he began to talk about medicine and astonished them still more he became the puzzle of the establishment the doctor and surgeon would converse with him and try and lead him to his past life but when it came to that he used to put his hands to his head with a face of great distress and it was clear some impassable barrier lay between his growing intelligence and the past events of his life indeed on one occasion he said to his kind friend the doctor the pasta black wall a black wall ten months after his admission he was promoted to be an attendant with a salary he put by every shilling of it for he said a voice from the dark past tells me money is everything in this world a discussion was held by the authorities as to whether he should be informed he had money and jewels at the bank or not upon the whole it was thought advisable to postpone this information lest he should throw it away but they told him he had been picked up at sea and both money and jewels found on him they were in safe hands only the person was away for the time still he was not to look upon himself as either friendless or moneyless at this communication he showed an almost childish delight that confirmed the doctor in his opinion he was acting prudently and for the real benefit of an amiable and afflicted person not yet to be trusted with money and jewels chapter xvii in his quality of attendant on the sick staines sometimes conducted a weak but convalescent patient into the open air and he was always pleased to do this for the air of the cape carries health and vigor on its wings he had seen its fine recreative properties and he divined somehow that the minds of convalescents ought to be amused and so he often begged the doctor to let him take a convalescent abroad sooner than not he would draw the patient several miles in a bath chair he rather liked this for he was a hercules and had no egotism or false pride where the sick were concerned now these openair walks exerted a beneficial influence on his own darkened mind it is one thing to struggle from idea to idea it is another when material objects mingle with the retrospect they seem to supply steppingstones in the gradual resuscitation of memory and reason the ships going out of port were such a steppingstone to him and a vague consciousness came back to him of having been in a ship unfortunately along with this reminiscence came a desire to go in one again and this sowed discontent in his mind and the more that mind enlarged the more he began to dislike the hospital and its confinement the feeling grew and bade fair to disqualify him for his humble office the authorities could not fail to hear of this and they had a little discussion about parting with him but they hesitated to turn him adrift and they still doubted the propriety of trusting him with money and jewels while matters were in this state a remarkable event occurred he drew a sick patient down to the quay one morning and watched the business of the port with the keenest interest a ship at anchor was unloading and a great heavy boat was sticking to her side like a black leech presently this boat came away and moved sluggishly towards the shore rather by help of the tide than of the two men who went through the form of propelling her with two monstrous sweeps while a third steered her she contained english goods agricultural implements some cases four horses and a buxom young woman with a thorough english face the woman seemed a little excited and as she neared the landingplace she called out in jocund tones to a young man on the shore it is all right dick they are beauties and she patted the beasts as people do who are fond of them she stepped lightly ashore and then came the slower work of landing her imports she bustled about like a hen over her brood and wasnt always talking but put in her word every now and then never crossly and always to the point staines listened to her and examined her with a sort of puzzled look but she took no notice of him her whole soul was in the cattle they got the things on board well enough but the horses were frightened at the gangway and jibbed then a man was for driving them and poked one of them in the quarter he snorted and reared directly man alive cried the young woman that is not the way they are docile enough but frightened encourage em and let em look at it give em time more haste less speed with timorous cattle that is a very pleasant voice said poor staines rather more dictatorially than became the present state of his intellect he added softly a true womans voice then gloomily a voice of the pastthe dark dark past at this speech intruding itself upon the short sentences of business there was a roar of laughter and phoebe falcon turned sharply round to look at the speaker she stared at him she cried oh and clasped her hands and colored all over why sure said she i cant be mistook those eyestis you doctor isnt it doctor said staines with a puzzled look yes i think they called me doctor once im an attendant in the hospital now dick cried phoebe in no little agitation come here this minute what afore i get the horses ashore ay before you do another thing or say another word come here now so he came and she told him to take a good look at the man now said she who is that blest if i know said he what not know the man who saved your own life oh dick what are your eyes worth this discourse brought the few persons within hearing into one band of excited starers dick took a good look and said im blest if i dont though it is the doctor that cut my throat this strange statement drew forth quite a shout of ejaculations oh better breathe through a slit than not at all said dick saved my life with that cut he did didnt he pheeb that he did dick dear heart i hardly know whether i am in my senses or not seeing him alooking so blank you try him dick came forward sure you remember me sir dick dale you cut my throat and saved my life cut your throat why that would kill you not the way you done it well sir you aint the man you was that is clear but you was a good friend to me and theres my hand thank you dick said staines and took his hand i dont remember you perhaps you are one of the past the past is dead wall to mea dark dead wall and he put his hands to his head with a look of distress everybody there now suspected the truth and some pointed mysteriously to their own heads phoebe whispered an inquiry to the sick person he said a little pettishly all i know is he is the kindest attendant in the ward and very attentive oh then he is in the public hospital of course he is the invalid with the selfishness of his class then begged staines to take him out of all this bustle down to the beach staines complied at once with the utmost meekness and said goodby old friends forgive me for not remembering you it is my great affliction that the past is gone from megone gone and he went sadly away drawing his sick charge like a patient mule phoebe falcon looked after him and began to cry nay nay phoebe said dick dont ye take on about it i wonder at you sobbed phoebe good people im fonder of my brother than he is of himself it seems for i cant take it so easy well the world is full of trouble let us do what we are here for but i shall pray for the poor soul every night that his mind may be given back to him so then she bustled and gave herself to getting the cattle on shore and the things put on board her wagon but when this was done she said to her brother dick i did not think anything on earth could take my heart off the cattle and the things we have got from home but i cant leave this without going to the hospital about our poor dear doctor and it is late for making a start any wayand you mustnt forget the newspapers for reginaldhe is so fond of themand you must contrive to have one sent out regular after this and ill go to the hospital she went and saw the head doctor and told him he had got an attendant there she had known in england in a very different condition and she had come to see if there was anything she could do for himfor she felt very grateful to him and grieved to see him so the doctor was pleased and surprised and put several questions then she gave him a clear statement of what he had done for dick in england well said the doctor i believe it is the same man for now you tell me thisyes one of the nurses told me he knew more about medicine than she did his name if you please his name sir yes his name of course you know his name is it christie doctor said phoebe blushing i dont know what you will think of me but i dont know his name laws forgive me i never had the sense to ask it a shade of suspicion crossed the doctors face phoebe saw it and colored to the temples oh sir she cried piteously dont go for to think i have told you a lie why should i and indeed i am not of that sort nor dick neither sir ill bring him to you and he will say the same well we were all in terror and confusion and i met him accidentally in the street he was only a customer till then and paid ready money so that is how i never knew his name but if i hadnt been the greatest fool in england i should have asked his wife what he has a wife ay sir the loveliest lady you ever clapped eyes on and he is almost as handsome has eyes in his head like jewels twas by them i knew him on the quay and i think he knew my voice again said as good as he had heard it in past times did he then we have got him cried the doctor energetically la sir yes if he knows your voice you will be able in time to lead his memory back at least i think so do you live in cape town dear heart no i live at my own farm a hundred and eighty miles from this what a pity why sir wellhum oh if you think i could do the poor doctor good by having him with me you have only to say the word and out he goes with dick and me tomorrow morning we should have started for home tonight but for this are you in earnest madam said the doctor opening his eyes would you really encumber yourself with a person whose reason is in suspense and may never return but that is not his fault sir why if a dog had saved my brothers life id take it home and keep it all its days and this is a man and a worthy man oh sir when i saw him brought down so and his beautiful eyes clouded like my very bosom yearned over the poor soul a kind act done in dear old england who can see the man in trouble here and not repay itay if it cost ones blood but indeed he is strong and healthy and hands are always scarce our way and the odds are he will earn his meat one way or tother and if he doesnt why all the better for me i shall have the pleasure of serving him for nought that once served me for neither money nor reward you are a good woman said the doctor warmly theres better and theres worse said phoebe quietly and even a little coldly more of the latter said the doctor dryly well mrs falcon sir we shall hand him over to your care but firstjust for formif you are a married woman we should like to see dick here he is your husband i presume ploebe laughed merrily dick is my brother and he cant be spared to come here dick hed say black was white if i told him to then let us see your husband about itjust for form my husband is at the farm i could not venture so far away and not leave him in charge if she had said i will not bring him into temptation that would have been nearer the truth let that fly stick on the wall sir what i do my husband will approve i see how it is you rule the roost phoebe did not reply pointblank to that she merely said all my chickens are happy great and small and an expression of lofty womanly innocent pride illuminated her face and made it superb for a moment in short it was settled that staines should accompany her next morning to dales kloof farm if he chose on inquiry it appeared that he had just returned to the hospital with his patient he was sent for and phoebe asked him sweetly if he would go with her to her house one hundred and eighty miles away and she would be kind to him on the water nay by land but tis a fine country and you will see beautiful deer and things running across the plains and shall i find the past again the past again ay poor soul that we shall god willing you and i we will hunt it together he looked at her and gave her his hand i will go with you your face belongs to the past so does your voice he then inquired rather abruptly had she any children she smiled ay that i have the loveliest little boy you ever saw when you are as you used to be you will be his doctor wont you yes i will nurse him and you will help me find the past phoebe then begged staines to be ready to start at six in the morning she and dick would take him up on their way while she was talking to him the doctor slipped out and to tell the truth he went to consult with another authority whether he should take this opportunity of telling staines that he had money and jewels at the bank he himself was half inclined to do so but the other who had not seen phoebes face advised him to do nothing of the kind they are always short of money these colonial farmers said he she would get every shilling out of him most would but this is such an honest face well but she is a mother you say yes well what mother could be just to a lunatic with her own sweet angel babes to provide for that is true said dr maternal love is apt to modify the conscience what i would doi would take her address and make her promise to write if he gets well and if he does get well then write to him and tell him all about it dr acted on this shrewd advice and ordered a bundle to be made up for the traveller out of the hospital stores it contained a nice light summer suit and two changes of linen chapter xviii next morning staines and dick dale walked through the streets of cape town side by side dick felt the uneasiness of a sane man not familiar with the mentally afflicted who suddenly finds himself alone with one insanity turns men oftenest into sheep and hares but it does now and then make them wolves and tigers and that has saddled the insane in general with a character for ferocity young dale then cast many a suspicious glance at his comrade as he took him along these glances were reassuring christophers face had no longer the mobility the expressive changes that mark the superior mind his countenance was monotonous but the one expression was engaging there was a sweet patient lamblike look the glorious eye a little troubled and perplexed but wonderfully mild dick dale looked and looked and his uneasiness vanished and the more he looked the more did a certain wonder creep over him and make him scarce believe the thing he knew viz that a learned doctor had saved him from the jaws of death by rare knowledge sagacity courage and skill combined and that mighty man of wisdom was brought down to this lamb and would go north south east or west with sweet and perfect submission even as he dick dale should appoint with these reflections honest dick felt his eyes get a little misty and to use those words of scripture which nothing can surpass or equal his bowels yearned over the man as for christopher he looked straight forward and said not a word till they cleared the town but when he saw the vast flowery vale and the faroff violet hills like scotland glorified he turned to dick with an ineffable expression of sweetness and good fellowship and said oh beautiful well hunt the past together wewillso said dick with a sturdy and indeed almost a stern resolution now this he said not that he cared for the past nor intended to waste the present by going upon its predecessors trail but he had come to a resolutionfull three minutes agoto humor his companion to the top of his bent and say yes with hypocritical vigor to everything not directly and immediately destructive to him and his the next moment they turned a corner and came upon the rest of their party hitherto hidden by the apricot hedge and a turning in the road a blueblack kafir with two yellow hottentot drivers man and boy was harnessing in the most primitive mode four horses on to the six oxen attached to the wagon and the horses were flattening their ears and otherwise resenting the incongruity meantime a fourth figure a colossal young kafir woman looked on superior with folded arms like a sable juno looking down with that absolute composure upon the struggles of man and other animals which lucretius and his master epicurus assigned to the divine nature without jesting the grandeur majesty and repose of this figure were unsurpassable in nature and such as have vanished from sculpture two thousand years and more dick dale joined the group immediately and soon arranged the matter meantime phoebe descended from the wagon and welcomed christopher very kindly and asked him if he would like to sit beside her or to walk he glanced into the wagon it was covered and curtained and dark as a cupboard i think said he timidly i shall see more of the past out here so you will poor soul said phoebe kindly and better for your health but you must not go far from the wagon for im a fidget and i have got the care of you now you know for want of a better come ucatella you must ride with me and help me sort the things they are all higgledypiggledy so those two got into the wagon through the back curtains then the kafir driver flourished his kambok or long whip in the air and made it crack like a pistol and the horses reared and the oxen started and slowly bored in between them for they whinnied and kicked and spread out like a fan all over the road but a flick or two from the terrible kambok soon sent them bleeding and trembling and rubbing shoulders and the oxen mildly but persistently goring their recalcitrating haunches the intelligent animals went ahead and revenged themselves by breaking the harness but that goes for little in cape travel the body of the wagon was long and low and very stout the tilt strong and tightmade the roof inside and most of the sides lined with green baize curtains of the same to the little window and the back there was a sort of hold literally built full of purchases a small fireproof safe huge blocks of salt saws axes pickaxes adzes flails tools innumerable bales of wool and linen stuff hams and two hundred empty sacks strewn over all in large pigeonholes fixed to the sides were light goods groceries collars glaring cotton handkerchiefs for phoebes aboriginal domestics since not every year did she go to cape town a twenty days journey by wagon things dangled from the very roof but no hard goods there if you please to batter ones head in a spill outside were latticed grooves with tent tentpoles and rifles great pieces of cork and bags of hay and corn hung dangling from mighty hooksthe latter to feed the cattle should they be compelled to camp out on some sterile spot on the veldt and methinks to act as buffers should the whole concern roll down a nullah or little precipice no very uncommon incident in the blessed region they must pass to reach dales kloof harness mended fresh start the hottentots and kafir vociferated and yelled and made the unearthly row of a dozen wild beasts wrangling the horses drew the bullocks they the wagon it crawled and creaked and its appendages wobbled finely slowly they creaked and wobbled past apricot hedges and detached houses and huts and got into an open country without a tree but here and there a stunted camelthorn the soil was arid and grew little food for man or beast yet by a singular freak of nature it put forth abundantly things that here at home we find it harder to raise than homely grass and oats the ground was thickly clad with flowers of delightful hues pyramids of snow or rosecolor bordered the track yellow and crimson stars bejewelled the ground and a thousand bulbous plants burst into all imaginable colors and spread a rainbow carpet to the foot of the violet hills and all this glowed and gleamed and glittered in a sun shining with incredible brightness and purity of light but somehow without giving a headache or making the air sultry christopher fell to gathering flowers and interrogating the past by means of them for he had studied botany the past gave him back some pitiably vague ideas he sighed never mind said he to dick and tapped his forehead it is here it is only locked up all right said dick nothing is lost when you know where tis this is a beautiful country suggested christopher it is all flowers it is like the garden ofthe garden oflocked up it is delightful replied the selfcompelled optimist sturdily but here nature gave way he was obliged to relieve his agricultural bile by getting into the cart and complaining to his sister twill take us all our time to cure him he have been bepraising this here soil which it is only fit to clean the womens kettles twouldnt feed three larks to an acre i know no nor half so many poor soul mayhap the flowers have took his eye sit here a bit dick i want to talk to you about a many things while these two were conversing ucatella who was very fond of phoebe but abhorred wagons stepped out and stalked by the side like an ostrich a camelopard or a taglioni nor did the effort with which she subdued her stride to the pace of the procession appear it was the poetry of walking christopher admired it a moment but the noble expanse tempted him and he strode forth like a giant his lungs inflating in the glorious air and soon left the wagon far behind the consequence was that when they came to a halt and dick and phoebe got out to release and water the cattle there was christophers figure retiring into space hanc rem aegre tulit phoebe as my old friend livy would say oh dear oh dear if he strays so far from us he will be eaten up at nightfall by jackals or lions or something one of you must go after him me go missy said ucatella zealously pleased with an excuse for stretching her magnificent limbs ay but mayhap he will not come back with you will he dick that he will like a lamb dick wanted to look after the cattle yuke my girl said phoebe listen he has been a good friend of ours in trouble and now he is not quite right here so be very kind to him but be sure and bring him back or keep him till we come me bring him back alive certain sure said ucatella smiling from ear to ear she started with a sudden glide like a boat taking the water and appeared almost to saunter away so easy was the motion but when you looked at the ground she was covering the stride or glide or whatever it was was amazing she seemd in walking to devour the way christopher walked fast but nothing like this and as he stopped at times to botanize and gaze at the violet hills and interrogate the past she came up with him about five miles from the haltingplace she laid her hand quietly on his shoulder and said with a broad genial smile and a musical chuckle ucatella come for you missy want to speak you oh very well and he turned back with her directly but she took him by the hand to make sure and they marched back peaceably in silence and hand in hand but he looked and looked at her and at last he stopped dead short and said a little arrogantly come i know you you are not locked up and he inspected her pointblank she stood like an antique statue and faced the examination you are the noble savage said he having concluded his inspection nay said she i be the housemaid the housemaid iss the housemaid ucatella so come on and she drew him along sore perplexed they met the cavalcade a mile from the haltingplace and phoebe apologized a little to christopher i hope youll excuse me sir said she but i am just for all the world like a hen with her chickens if but one strays im all in a flutter till i get him back madam said christopher i am very unhappy at the way things are locked up please tell me truly is this the housemaid or the noble savage well she is both if you go to that and the best creature ever breathed then she is the noble savage ay so they call her because she is black then thank heaven said christopher the past is not all locked up that afternoon they stopped at an inn but dick slept in the cart at three in the morning they took the road again and creaked along supernaturally loud under a purple firmament studded with huge stars all bright as moons that lit the way quite clear and showed black things innumerable flitting to and fro these made phoebe shudder but were no doubt harmless still dick carried his double rifle and a revolver in his belt they made a fine march in the cool until some slight mists gathered and then they halted and breakfasted near a silvery kloof and watered the cattle while thus employed suddenly a golden tinge seemed to fall like a lash on the vapors of night they scudded away directly as jackals before the lion the stars paled and with one incredible bound the mighty sun leaped into the horizon and rose into the sky in a moment all the lesser lamps of heaven were out though late so glorious and there was nothing but one vast vaulted turquoise and a great flaming topaz mounting with eternal ardor to its centre this did not escape christopher what is this said he no twilight the tropics he managed to dig that word out of the past in a moment at ten oclock the sun was so hot that they halted and let the oxen loose till sundown then they began to climb the mountains the way was steep and rugged indeed so rough in places that the cattle had to jump over the holes and as the wagon could not jump so cleverly it jolted appallingly and many a scream issued forth near the summit when the poor beasts were dead beat they got into clouds and storms and the wind rushed howling at them through the narrow pass with such fury it flattened the horses ears and bade fair to sweep the whole cavalcade to the plains below christopher and dick walked close behind under the lee of the wagon christopher said in dicks ear dye hear that time to reef topsails captain it is time to do something said dick he took advantage of a jutting rock drew the wagon half behind it and across the road propped the wheels with stones and they all huddled to leeward man and beast indiscriminately ah said christopher approvingly we are lying to a verypropercourse they huddled and shivered three hours and then the sun leaped into the sky and lo a transformation scene the cold clouds were first rosy fleeces then golden ones then golddust then gone the rain was big diamonds then crystal sparks then gone the rocks and the bushes sparkled with gemlike drops and shone and smiled the shivering party bustled and toasted the potent luminary in hot coffee for phoebes wagon had a stove and chimney and then they yoked their miscellaneous cattle again and breasted the hill with many a jump and bump and jolt and scream from inside they reached the summit and looked down on a vast slope flowering but arid a region of gaudy sterility the descent was more tremendous than the ascent and phoebe got out and told christopher she would liever cross the ocean twice than this dreadful mountain once the hottentot with the reins was now bent like a bow all the time keeping the cattle from flowing diverse over precipices and the kafir with his kambok was here and there and everywhere his whip flicking like a lancet and cracking like a horsepistol and the pair vied like apollo and pan not which could sing sweetest but swear loudest having the lofty hill for some hours between them and the sun they bumped and jolted and stuck in mudholes and flogged and swore the cattle out of them again till at last they got to the bottom where ran a turbid kloof or stream it was fordable but the recent rains had licked away the slope so the existing bank was two feet above the stream little recked the demon drivers or the parched cattle in they plunged promiscuously with a flop like thunder followed by an awful splashing the wagon stuck fast in the mud the horses tied themselves in a knot and rolled about in the stream and the oxen drank imperturbably oh the salt the salt screamed phoebe and the rocks reechoed her lamentations the wagon was inextricable the cattle done up the savages lazy so they stayed for several hours christopher botanized but not alone phoebe drew ucatella apart and explained to her that when a man is a little wrong in the head it makes a child of him so said she you must think he is your child and never let him out of your sight all right said the sable juno who spoke english ridiculously well and rapped out idioms especially come on and all right about dusk what the drivers had foreseen though they had not the sense to explain it took place the kloof dwindled to a mere gutter and the wagon stuck high and dry phoebe waved her handkerchief to ucatella ucatella who had dogged christopher about four hours without a word now took his hand and said my child missy wants us come on and so led him unresistingly the drivers flogging like devils cursing like troopers and yelling like hyenas gone mad tried to get the wagon off but it was fast as a rock then dick and the hottentot put their shoulders to one wheel and tried to prise it up while the kafir encouraged the cattle with his thong observing this christopher went in with his sable custodian at his heels and heaved at the other embedded wheel the wagon was lifted directly so that the cattle tugged it out and they got clear on examination the salt had just escaped says ucatella to phoebe a little ostentatiously my child is strong and useful make little missy a good slave a slave heaven forbid said phoebe hell be a father to us all once he gets his head back and i do think it is comingbut very slow the next three days offered the ordinary incidents of african travel but nothing that operated much on christophers mind which is the true point of this narrative and as there are many admirable books of african travel it is the more proper i should confine myself to what may be called the relevant incidents of the journey on the sixth day from cape town they came up with a large wagon stuck in a mudhole there was quite a party of boers hottentots kafirs round it armed with whips shamboks and oaths lashing and cursing without intermission or any good effect and there were the wretched beasts straining in vain at their choking yokes moaning with anguish trembling with terror their poor mild eyes dilated with agony and fear and often when the blows of the cruel shamboks cut open their bleeding flesh they bellowed to heaven their miserable and vain protest against this devils work then the past opened its stores and lent christopher a word barbarians he roared and seized a gigantic kafir by the throat just as his shambok descended for the hundredth time there was a mighty struggle as of two titans dust flew round the combatants in a cloud a whirling of big bodies and down they both went with an awful thud the saxon uppermost by natures law the kafirs companions amazed at first began to roll their eyes and draw a knife or two but dick ran forward and said dont hurt him he is wrong here this representation pacified them more readily than one might have expected dick added hastily well get you out of the hole our way and cry quits the proposal was favorably received and the next minute christopher and ucatella at one wheel and dick and the hottentot at the other with no other help than two pointed iron bars bought for their shepherds had effected what sixteen oxen could not to do this dick dale had bared his arm to the shoulder it was a stalwart limb like his sisters and he now held it out all swollen and corded and slapped it with his other hand lookee here you chaps said he the worst use a man can put that there to is to go cutting out a poor beasts heart for not doing more than he can you are good fellows you kafirs but i think you have sworn never to put your shoulder to a wheel but bless your poor silly hearts a little strength put on at the right place is better than a deal at the wrong you hear that you kafir chaps inquired ucatella a little arrogantlyfor a kafir the kafirs who had stood quite silent to imbibe these remarks bowed their heads with all the dignity and politeness of roman senators spanish grandees etc and one of the party replied gravely the words of the white man are always wise and his arm blanked strong said christophers late opponent from whose mind however all resentment had vanished i take this very useful expression from a delightful volume by mr boyle thus spake the kafirs yet to this day never hath a man of all their tribe put his shoulder to a wheel so strong is custom in south africa probably in all africa since i remember st augustin found it stronger than he liked at carthage ucatella went to phoebe and said missy my child is good and brave bother you and your child said poor phoebe to think of his flying at a giant like that and you letting of him im all of a tremble from head to foot and phoebe relieved herself with a cry oh missy said ucatella there never mind me do go and look after your child and keep him out of more mischief i wish we were safe at dales kloof i do ucatella complied and went botanizing with dr staines but that gentleman in the course of his scientific researches into camomile flowers and blasted heath which were all that lovely region afforded suddenly succumbed and stretched out his limbs and said sleepily goodnightucat and was off into the land of nod the wagon which by the way had passed the larger but slower vehicle found him fast asleep and ucatella standing by him as ordered motionless and grand oh dear what now said phoebe but being a sensible woman though in the hen and chickens line she said tis the fighting and the excitement twill do him more good than harm i think and she had him bestowed in the wagon and never disturbed him night nor day he slept thirtysix hours at a stretch and when he awoke she noticed a slight change in his eye he looked at her with an interest he had not shown before and said madam i know you thank god for that said phoebe you kept a little shop in the other world phoebe opened her eyes with some little alarm you understandthe world that is locked upfor the present well sir so i did and sold you milk and butter dont you mind nothe milk and butterthey are locked up the country became wilder the signs of life miserably sparse about every twenty miles the farmhouse or hut of a degenerate boer whose children and slaves pigged together and all ran jostling and the mistress screamed in her shrill dutch and the hottentots all chirped together and confusion reigned for want of method often they went miles and saw nothing but a hut or two with a nude hottentot eating flesh burnt a little but not cooked at the door and the kloofs became deeper and more turbid and phoebe was in an agony about her salt and christopher advised her to break it in big lumps and hang it all about the wagon in sacks and she did and ucatella said profoundly my child is wise and they began to draw near home and phoebe to fidget and she said to christopher oh dear i hope they are all alive and well once you leave home you dont know what may have happened by then you come back one comfort ive got sophy she is very dependable and no beauty thank my stars that night the last they had to travel was cloudy for a wonder and they groped with lanterns ucatella and her child brought up the rear presently there was a light pattering behind them the swifteared ucatella clutched christophers arm and turning round pointed back with eyeballs white and rolling there were full a dozen animals following them whose bodies seemed colorless as shadows but their eyes little balls of flaming limelight gun said christie and gave the kafirs arm a pinch she flew to the caravan he walked backwards facing the foe the wagon was halted and dick ran back with two loaded rifles in his haste he gave one to christopher and repented at leisure but christopher took it and handled it like an experienced person and said with delight volunteer but with this the cautious animals had vanished like bubbles but dick told christopher they would be sure to come back he ordered ucatella into the wagon and told her to warn phoebe not to be frightened if guns should be fired this soothing message brought phoebes white face out between the curtains and she implored them to get into the wagon and not tempt providence not till i have got thee a kaross of jackals fur ill never wear it said phoebe violently to divert him from his purpose time will show said dick dryly these varmint are on and off like shadows and as cunning as old nick we two will walk on quite unconcerned like and as soon as ever the varmint are at our heels you give us the office and well pepper their furwont we doctor wewillpeppertheir fur said christopher repeating what to him was a lesson in the ancient and venerable english tongue so they walked on expectant and by and by the fourfooted shadows with large limelight eyes came stealing on and phoebe shrieked and they vanished before the men could draw a bead on them thous no use at this work pheeb said dick shut thy eyes and let us have yuke iss master here i be you can bleat like a lamb for ive heard ye iss master i bleats beautiful and she showed snowy teeth from ear to ear well then when the varmint are at our heels draw in thy woolly head and bleat like a young lamb they wont turn from that i know the vagabonds matters being thus prepared they sauntered on but the jackals were very wary they came like shadows so departeda great many times but at last being reenforced they lessened the distance and got so close that ucatella withdrew her head and bleated faintly inside the wagon the men turned levelling their rifles and found the troop within twenty yards of them they wheeled directly but the four barrels poured their flame four loud reports startled the night and one jackal lay dead as a stone another limped behind the flying crowd and one lay kicking he was soon despatched and both carcasses flung over the patient oxen and goodby jackals for the rest of that journey ucatella with all a kafirs love of firearms clapped her hands with delight my child shoots loud and strong said she ay ay replied phoebe they are all alike wherever theres men look for quarrelling and firing off we had only to sit quiet in the wagon ay said dick the cattle especiallyfor it is them the varmint were afterand let em eat my hottentots at this picture of the cattle inside the wagon and the jackals supping on cold hottentot alongside phoebe who had no more humor than a cat but a heart of gold shut up and turned red with confusion at her false estimate of the recent transaction in fur when the sun rose they found themselves in a tract somewhat less arid and inhuman and at last at the rise of a gentle slope they saw half a mile before them a large farmhouse partly clad with creepers and a little plot of turf the fruit of eternal watering item a flowerbed item snowwhite palings item an air of cleanliness and neatness scarcely known to those dirty descendants of clean ancestors the boers at some distance a very large dam glittered in the sun and a troop of snowwhite sheep were watering at it england cried christopher ay sir said phoebe as nigh as man can make it but soon she began to fret oh dear where are they all if it was me id be at the door looking out ah there goes yuke to rouse them up come pheeb dont you fidget said dick kindly why the lazy lot are scarce out of their beds by this time more shame for em if they were away from me and coming home i should be at the door day and night i know ah she uttered a scream of delight for just then out came ucatella with little tommy on her shoulder and danced along to meet her as she came close she raised the chubby child high in the air and he crowed and then she lowered him to his mother who rushed at him seized and devoured him with a hundred inarticulate cries of joy and love unspeakable nature said christopher dogmatically recognizing an old acquaintance and booking it as one more conquest gained over the past but there was too much excitement over the cherub to attend to him so he watched the woman gravely and began to moralize with all his might this said he is what we used to call maternal love and all animals had it and that is why the noble savage went for him it was very good of you miss savage said the poor soul sententiously good of her cried phoebe she is all goodness savage find me a dutchwoman like her ill give her a good cuddle for it and she took the kafir round the neck and gave her a hearty kiss and made the little boy kiss her too at this moment out came a collie dog hunting ucatella by scent alone which process landed him headlong in the group he gave loud barks of recognition fawned on phoebe and dick smelt poor christopher gave a growl of suspicion and lurked about squinting dissatisfied and lowering his tail thou art wrong lad for once said dick for hes an old friend and a good one after the dog perhaps some christian will come to welcome us said poor phoebe obedient to the wish out walked sophy the english nurse a scraggy woman with a very cocked nose and thin pinched lips and an air of respectability and pertness mingled she dropped a short courtesy shot the glance of a basilisk at ucatella and said stiffly you are welcome home maam then she took the little boy as one having authority not that phoebe would have surrendered him but just then mr falcon strolled out with a cigar in his mouth and phoebe with her heart in her mouth flew to meet him there was a rapturous conjugal embrace followed by mutual inquiries and the wagon drew up at the door then for the first time falcon observed staines saw at once he was a gentleman and touched his hat to him to which christopher responded in kind and remembered he had done so in the lockedup past phoebe instantly drew her husband apart by the sleeve who do you think that is youll never guess tis the great doctor that saved dicks life in england with cutting of his throat but oh my dear he is not the man he was he is afflicted out of his mind partly well we must cure him and square the account for dick im a proud woman at finding him and bringing him here to make him all right again i can tell you oh i am happy i am happy little did i think to be so happy as i am and my dear i have brought you a whole sackful of newspapers old and new that is a good girl but tell me a little more about him what is his name christie dr christie no doubt he wasnt an apothecary or a chemist you may be sure but a high doctor and the cleverest ever was or ever will be and isnt it sad love to see him brought down so my heart yearns for the poor man and then his wifethe sweetest loveliest creature you everoh phoebe stopped very short for she remembered something all of a sudden nor did she ever again give falcon a chance of knowing that the woman whose presence had so disturbed him was this very dr christies wife curious thought she to herself the world to be so large and yet so small then aloud they are unpacking the wagon come dear i dont think i have forgotten anything of yours theres cigars and tobacco and powder and shot and bullets and everything to make you comfortable as my duty tis andoh but im a happy woman hottentots big and little clustered about the wagon treasure after treasure was delivered with cries of delight the dogs found out it was a joyful time and barked about the wheeled treasury and the place did not quiet down till sunset a plain but tidy little room was given to christopher and he slept there like a top next morning his nurse called him up to help her water the grass she led the way with a tub on her head and two buckets in it she took him to the dam when she got there she took out the buckets left one on the bank and gave the other to christie she then went down the steps till the water was up to her neck and bade christie fill the tub he poured eight bucketsful in then she came slowly out straight as an arrow balancing this tub full on her head then she held out her hands for the two buckets christie filled them wondering and gave them to her she took them like toy buckets and glided slowly home with this enormous weight and never spilled a drop indeed the walk was more smooth and noble than ever if possible when she reached the house she hailed a hottentot and it cost the man and christopher a great effort of strength to lower her tub between them what a vertebral column you must have said christopher you must not speak bad words my child said she now you water the grass and the flowers she gave him a wateringpot and watched him maternally but did not put a hand to it she evidently considered this part of the business as childs play and not a fit exercise of her powers it was only by drowning that little oasis twice a day that the grass was kept green and the flowers alive she found him other jobs in course of the day and indeed he was always helping somebody or other and became quite ruddy bronzed and plump of cheek and wore a strange look of happiness except at times when he got apart and tried to recall the distant past then he would knit his brow and looked perplexed and sad they were getting quite used to him and he to them when one day he did not come in to dinner phoebe sent out for him but they could not find him the sun set phoebe became greatly alarmed and even dick was anxious they all turned out with guns and dogs and hunted for him beneath the stars just before daybreak dick dale saw a fire sparkle by the side of a distant thicket he went to it and there was ucatella seated calm and grand as antique statue and christopher lying by her side with a shawl thrown over him as dale came hurriedly up she put her finger to her lips and said my child sleeps do not wake him when he sleeps he hunts the past as collie hunts the springbok heres a go said dick then hearing a chuckle he looked up and was aware of a comical appendage to the scene there hung head downwards from a branch a kafir boy who was in fact the brother of the stately ucatella only went further into antiquity for his models of deportment for as she imitated the antique marbles he reproduced the habits of that epoch when man roosted and was arboreal wheel somersaults and above all swinging head downwards from a branch were the sweeteners of his existence oh you are there are you said dick iss said ucatella tim good boy tim found my child well said dick he has chosen a nice place this is the clump the last lion came out of at least they say so for my part i never saw an african lion falcon says theyve all took ship and gone to england however i shall stay here with my rifle till daybreak tis tempting providence to lie down on the skirt of a wood for lord knows what to jump out on ye unawares tim was sent home for hottentots and christopher was carried home still sleeping and laid on his own bed he slept twentyfour hours more and when he was fairly awake a sort of mist seemed to clear away in places and he remembered things at random he remembered being at sea on the raft with the dead body that picture was quite vivid to him he remembered too being in the hospital and meeting phoebe and every succeeding incident but as respected the more distant past he could not recall it by any effort of his will his mind could only go into that remoter past by material steppingstones and what steppingstones he had about him here led him back to general knowledge but not to his private history in this condition he puzzled them all strangely at the farm his mind was alternately so clear and so obscure he would chat with phoebe and sometimes give her a good practical hint but the next moment helpless for want of memory that great faculty without which judgment cannot act having no material after some days of this he had another great sleep it brought him back the distant past in chapters his weddingday his wifes face and dress upon that day his parting with her his whole voyage out but strange to say it swept away onehalf of that which he had recovered at his last sleep and he no longer remembered clearly how he came to be at dales kloof thus his mind might be compared to one climbing a slippery place who gains a foot or two then slips back but on the whole gains more than he loses he took a great liking to falcon that gentleman had the art of pleasing and the tact never to offend falcon affected to treat the poor souls want of memory as a common infirmity pretended he was himself very often troubled in the same way and advised him to read the newspapers my good wife said he has brought me a whole file of the cape gazette id read them if i was you the deuce is in it if you dont rake up something or other christopher thanked him warmly for this he got the papers to his own little room and had always one or two in his pocket for reading at first he found a good many hard words that puzzled him and he borrowed a pencil of phoebe and noted them down strange to say the words that puzzled him were always common words that his unaccountable memory had forgotten a hard word he was sure to remember that one day he had to ask falcon the meaning of spendthrift falcon told him briefly he could have illustrated the word by a striking example but he did not he added in his polite way no fellow can understand all the words in a newspaper now heres a word in mineanemometer who the deuce can understand such a word oh that is a common word enough said poor christopher it means a machine for measuring the force of the wind oh indeed said falcon but did not believe a word of it one sultry day christopher had a violent headache and complained to ucatella she told phoebe and they bound his brows with a wet handkerchief and advised him to keep indoors he sat down in the coolest part of the house and held his head with his hands for it seemed as if it would explode into two great fragments all in a moment the sky was overcast with angry clouds whirling this way and that huge drops of hail pattered down and the next minute came a tremendous flash of lightning accompanied rather than followed by a crash of thunder close over their heads this was the opening down came a deluge out of clouds that looked mountains of pitch and made the day night but for the fast and furious strokes of lightning that fired the air the scream of wind and awful peals of thunder completed the horrors of the scene in the midst of this by what agency i know no more than science or a sheep does something went off inside christophers head like a pistolshot he gave a sort of scream and dashed out into the weather phoebe heard his scream and his flying footstep and uttered an ejaculation of fear the whole household was alarmed and under other circumstances would have followed him but you could not see ten yards a chill sense of impending misfortune settled on the house phoebe threw her apron over her head and rocked in her chair dick himself looked very grave ucatella would have tried to follow him but dick forbade her tis no use said he when it clears we that be men will go for him pray heaven you may find him alive i dont think but what we shall theres nowhere he can fall down to hurt himself nor yet drown himself but our dam and he has not gone that way but but what if we do find him we must take him back to cape town before he does himself or some one a mischief why phoebe dont you see the man has gone raving mad chapter xix the electrified man rushed out into the storm but he scarcely felt it in his body the effect on his mind overpowered hailstones the lightning seemed to light up the past the mighty explosions of thunder seemed cannon strokes knocking down a wall and letting in his whole life six hours the storm raged and before it ended he had recovered nearly his whole past except his voyage with captain doddthat indeed he never recoveredand the things that happened to him in the hospital before he met phoebe falcon and her brother and as soon as he had recovered his lost memory his body began to shiver at the hail and rain he tried to find his way home but missed it not so much however but that he recovered it as soon as it began to clear and just as they were coming out to look for him he appeared before them dripping shivering very pale and worn with the handkerchief still about his head at sight of him dick slipped back to his sister and said rather roughly there now you may leave off crying he is come home and tomorrow i take him to cape town christopher crept in a dismal sinister figure oh sir said phoebe was this a day for a christian to be out in how could you go and frighten us so forgive me madam said christopher humbly i was not myself the best thing you can do now is to go to bed and let us send you up something warm you are very good said christopher and retired with the air of one too full of great amazing thoughts to gossip he slept thirty hours at a stretch and then awaking in the dead of night he saw the past even more clear and vivid he lighted his candle and began to grope in the cape gazette as to dates he now remembered when he had sailed from england and also from madeira following up this clew he found in the gazette a notice that h m ship amphitrite had been spoken off the cape and had reported the melancholy loss of a promising physician and man of science dr staines the account said every exertion had been made to save him but in vain staines ground his teeth with rage at this every exertion the falsehearted curs they left me to drown without one manly effort to save me curse them and curse all the world pursuing his researches rapidly he found a much longer account of a raft picked up by captain dodd with a white man on it and a dead body the white man having on him a considerable sum in money and jewels then a new anxiety chilled him there was not a word to identify him with dr staines the idea had never occurred to the editor of the cape gazette still less would it occur to any one in england at this moment his wife must be mourning for him poorpoor rosa but perhaps the fatal news might not have reached her that hope was dashed away as soon as found why these were all old newspapers that gentlemanly man who had lent them to him had said so old yet they completed the year he now tore through them for the dates alone and soon found they went to yet they were old papers he had sailed in may my god he cried in agony i have lost a year this thought crushed him by and by he began to carry this awful idea into details my rosa has worn mourning for me and put it off again i am dead to her and to all the world he wept long and bitterly those tears cleared his brain still more for all that he was not yet himself at least i doubt it his insanity driven from the intellect fastened one lingering claw into his moral nature and hung on by it his soul filled with bitterness and a desire to be revenged on mankind for their injustice and this thought possessed him more than reason he joined the family at breakfast and never a word all the time but when he got up to go he said in a strange dogged way as if it went against the grain god bless the house that succors the afflicted then he went out to brood alone dick said phoebe theres a change ill never part with him and look theres collie following him that never could abide him part with him said reginald of course not he is a gentleman and they are not so common in africa dick who hated falcon ignored this speech entirely and said well pheeb you and collie are wiser than i am take your own way and dont blame me if anything happens soon christopher paid the penalty of returning reason he suffered all the poignant agony a great heart can endure so this was his reward for his great act of selfdenial in leaving his beloved wife he had lost his patient he had lost the income from that patient his wife was worse off than before and had doubtless suffered the anguish of a loving heart bereaved his mind which now seemed more vigorous than ever after its long rest placed her before his very eyes pale and worn with grief in her widows cap at the picture he cried like the rain he could give her joy by writing but he could not prevent her from suffering a whole year of misery turning this over in connection with their poverty his evil genius whispered by this time she has received the six thousand pounds for your death she would never think of that but her father has and there is her comfort assured in spite of the caitiffs who left her husband to drown like a dog i know my rosa he thought she has swoonedah my poor darlingshe has ravedshe has wept he wept himself at the thoughtshe has mourned every indiscreet act as if it was a crime but she has done all this her good and loving but shallow nature is now at rest from the agonies of bereavement and nought remains but sad and tender regrets she can better endure that than poverty cursed poverty which has brought her and me to this and is the only real evil in the world but bodily pain then came a struggle that lasted a whole week and knitted his brows and took the color from his cheek but it ended in the triumph of love and hate over conscience and common sense his rosa should not be poor and he would cheat some of those contemptible creatures called men who had done him nothing but injustice and at last had sacrificed his life like a rats when the struggle was over and the fatal resolution taken then he became calmer less solitary and more sociable phoebe who was secretly watching him with a womans eye observed this change in him and with benevolent intentions invited him one day to ride round the farm with her he consented readily she showed him the fields devoted to maize and wheat and then the sheepfolds tims sheep were apparently deserted but he was discovered swinging head downwards from the branch of a camelthorn and seeing him it did strike one that if he had had a tail he would have been swinging by that phoebe called to him he never answered but set off running to her and landed himself under her nose in a wheel somersault i hope you are watching them tim said his mistress iss missy always washing em why theres one straying towards the wood now he not go far said tim coolly the young monkey stole off a little way then fell flat and uttered the cry of a jackal with startling precision back went the sheep to his comrades post haste and tim effected a somersault and a chuckle you are a clever boy said phoebe so that is how you manage them dat one way missy said tim not caring to reveal all his resources at once then phoebe rode on and showed christopher the ostrich pan it was a large basin a form the soil often takes in these parts and in it strutted several fullgrown ostriches and their young bred on the premises there was a little dam of water and plenty of food about they were herded by a kafir infant of about six black glossy fat and clean being in the water six times a day sometimes one of the older birds would show an inclination to stray out of the pan then the infant rolled after her and tapped her ankles with a wand she instantly came back but without any loss of dignity for she strutted with her nose in the air affecting completely to ignore the inferior little animal that was nevertheless controlling her movements theres a farce said phoebe but you would not believe the money they cost me nor the money they bring me in grain will not sell here for a quarter its value and we cant afford to send it to cape town twenty days and back but finery that sells everywhere i gather sixty pounds the year off those poor fowls backsclear profit she showed him the granary and told him there wasnt such another in africa this farm had belonged to one of the old dutch settlers and that breed had been going down this many a year you see sir dick and i being english and not downright in want of money we cant bring ourselves to sell grain to the middlemen for nothing so we store it hoping for better times that maybe will never come now ill show you how the dam is made they inspected the dam all round this is our best friend of all said she without this the sun would turn us all to tindercrops flowers beasts and folk oh indeed said staines then it is a pity you have not built it more scientifically i must have a look at this ay do sir and advise us if you see anything wrong but hark it is milking time come and see that so she led the way to some sheds and there they found several cows being milked each by a little calf and a little hottentot at the same time and both fighting and jostling each other for the udder now and then a young cow unused to incongruous twins would kick impatiently at both animals and scatter them that is their way said phoebe they have got it into their silly hottentot heads as kye wont yield their milk if the calf is taken away and it is no use arguing with em they will have their own way but they are very trusty and honest poor things we soon found that out when we came here first it was in a hired wagon and hottentot drivers so when we came to settle i made ready for a bit of a wrangle but my maid sophy that is nurse now and a great despiser of heathens she says dont you trouble them nasty ignorant blacks never charges more than their due i forgive em says i i wish all white folk was as nice however i did give them a trifle over for luck and then they got together and chattered something near the door hand in hand la sophy says i what is up now says she they are blessing of us things is come to a pretty pass for ignorant muslinmen heathen to be blessing christian folk well says i it wont hurt us any i dont know says she i dont want the devil prayed over me so she cocked that long nose of hers and followed it in a doors by this time they were near the house and phoebe was obliged to come to her postscript for the sake of which believe me she had uttered every syllable of this varied chat well sir said she affecting to proceed without any considerable change of topic and how do you find yourself have you discovered the past i have madam i remember every leading incident of my life and has it made you happier said phoebe softly no said christopher gravely memory has brought me misery i feared as much for you have lost your fine color and your eyes are hollow and lines on your poor brow that were not there before are you not sorry you have discovered the past no mrs falcon give me the sovereign gift of reason with all the torture it can inflict i thank god for returning memory even with the misery it brings phoebe was silent a long time then she said in a low gentle voice and with the indirectness of a truly feminine nature i have plenty of writingpaper in the house and the post goes south tomorrow such as tis christopher struggled with his misery and trembled he was silent a long time then he said no it is her interest that i should be dead well but sirtake a thought not a word more i implore you i am the most miserable man that ever breathed as he spoke two bitter tears forced their way phoebe cast a look of pity on him and said no more but she shook her head her plain common sense revolted however it did not follow he would be in the same mind next week so she was in excellent spirits at her proteges recovery and very proud of her cure and celebrated the event with a roaring supper including an english ham and a bottle of port wine and ten to one that was english too dick dale looked a little incredulous but he did not spare the ham any the more for that after supper in a pause of conversation staines turned to dick and said rather abruptly suppose that dam of yours were to burst and empty its contents would it not be a great misfortune to you misfortune sir dont talk of it why it would ruin us beast and body well it will burst if it is not looked to dales kloof dam burst the biggest and strongest for a hundred miles round you deceive yourself it is not scientifically built to begin and there is a cause at work that will infallibly burst it if not looked to in time and what is that sir the dam is full of crabs so tis but what of them i detected two of them that had perforated the dyke from the wet side to the dry and water was trickling through the channel they had made now for me to catch two that had come right through there must be a great many at work honeycombing your dyke those channels once made will be enlarged by the permeating water and a mere cupful of water forced into a dyke by the great pressure of a heavy column has an expansive power quite out of proportion to the quantity forced in colossal dykes have been burst in this way with disastrous effects indeed it is only a question of time and i would not guarantee your dyke twelve hours it is full too with the heavy rains heres a go said dick turning pale well if it is to burst it must why so you can make it safe in a few hours you have got a clumsy contrivance for letting off the excess of water let us go and relieve the dam at once of two feet of water that will make it safe for a day or two and tomorrow we will puddle it afresh and demolish those busy excavators he spoke with such authority and earnestness that they all got up from table a horn was blown that soon brought the hottentots and they all proceeded to the dam with infinite difficulty they opened the waste sluice lowered the water two feet and so drenched the arid soil that in fortyeight hours flowers unknown sprang up next morning under the doctors orders all the black men and boys were diving with lumps of stiff clay and puddling the endangered wall with a thick wall of it this took all the people the whole day next day the clay wall was carried two feet higher and then the doctor made them work on the other side and buttress the dyke with supports so enormous as seemed extravagant to dick and phoebe but after all it was as well to be on the safe side they thought and soon they were sure of it for the whole work was hardly finished when the news came in that the dyke of a neighboring boer ten miles off had exploded like a cannon and emptied itself in five minutes drowning the farmyard and floating the furniture but leaving them all to perish of drought and indeed the boers cart came every day with empty barrels for some time to beg water of the dales ucatella pondered all this and said her doctor child was wise this brief excitement over staines went back to his own gloomy thoughts and they scarcely saw him except at suppertime one evening he surprised them all by asking if they would add to all their kindness by lending him a horse and a spade and a few pounds to go to the diamond fields dick dale looked at his sister she said we had rather lend them you to go home with sir if you must leave us but dear heart i was half in hopesdick and i were talking it over only yesterdaythat you would go partners like with us ever since you saved the dam i have too little to offer for that mrs falcon and besides i am driven into a corner i must make money quickly or not at all the diamonds are only three hundred miles off for heavens sake let me try my luck they tried to dissuade him and told him not one in fifty did any good at it ay but i shall said he great bad luck is followed by great good luck and i feel my turn is come not that i rely on luck an accident directed my attention to the diamond a few years ago and i read a number of prime works upon the subject that told me of things not known to the miners it is clear from the cape journals that they are looking for diamonds in the river only now i am sure that is a mistake diamonds like gold have their matrix and it is comparatively few gems that get washed into the river i am confident that i shall find the volcanic matrix and perhaps make my fortune in a week or two when the dialogue took this turn reginald falcons cheek began to flush and his eyes to glitter christopher continued you who have befriended me so will not turn back i am sure when i have such a chance before me and as for the small sum of money i shall require i will repay you some day even if la sir dont talk so if you put it that way why the best horse we have and fifty pounds in good english gold they are at your service tomorrow and pick and spade to boot said dick and a double rifle for there are lions and lord knows what between this and the vaal river god bless you both said christopher i will start tomorrow and ill go with you said reginald falcon chapter xx heaven forbid said phoebe no my dear no more diamonds for us we never had but one and it brought us trouble nonsense phoebe replied falcon it was not the diamonds fault you know i have often wanted to go there but you objected you said you were afraid some evil would befall me but now solomon himself is going to the mines let us have no more of that nonsense we will take our rifles and our pistols therethererifles and pistols cried phoebe that shows and we will be there in a week stay a month and home with our pockets full of diamonds and find me dead of a broken heart broken fiddlestick we have been parted longer than that and yet here we are all right ay but the pitcher that goes too often to the well gets broke at last no reginald now i have tasted three years happiness and peace of mind i cannot go through what i used in england oh doctor have you the heart to part man and wife that have never been a day from each other all these years mrs falcon i would not do it for all the diamonds in brazil no mr falcon i need hardly say how charmed i should be to have your company but that is a pleasure i shall certainly deny myself after what your good wife has said i owe her too much to cause her a single pang doctor said the charming reginald you are a gentleman and side with the lady quite right it adds to my esteem if possible make your mind easy i will go alone i am not a farmer i am dead sick of this monotonous life and since i am compelled to speak my mind a little ashamed as a gentleman of living on my wife and her brother and doing nothing for myself so i shall go to the vaal river and see a little life here theres nothing but vegetationand not much of that not a word more phoebe if you please i am a good easy affectionate husband but i am a man and not a child to be tied to a womans apronstrings however much i may love and respect her dick put in his word since you are so independent you can walk to the vaal river i cant spare a couple of horses this hit the sybarite hard and he cast a bitter glance of hatred at his brotherinlaw and fell into a moody silence but when he got phoebe to himself he descanted on her selfishness dicks rudeness and his own wounded dignity till he made her quite anxious he should have his own way she came to staines with red eyes and said tell me doctor will there be any women up thereto take care of you not a petticoat in the place i believe it is a very rough life and how falcon could think of leaving you and sweet little tommy and this life of health and peace and comfort yet you do leave us sir i am the most unfortunate man upon the earth falcon is one of the happiest would i leave wife and child to go there ah me i am dead to those i love this is my one chance of seeing my darling again for many a long year perhaps oh i must not speak of herit unmans me my good kind friend ill tell you what to do when we are all at supper let a horse be saddled and left in the yard for me ill bid you all goodnight and ill put fifty miles between us before morning even then he need not be told i am gone he will not follow me you are very good sir said phoebe but no too much has been said i cant have him humbled by my brother nor any one he says i am selfish perhaps i am though i never was called so i cant bear he should think me selfish he will go and so let us have no ill blood about it since he is to go of course id much liever he should go with you than by himself you are sure there are no women up thereto take care ofyouboth you must be pursebearer sir and look to every penny he is too generous when he has got money to spend in short reginald had played so upon her heart that she now urged the joint expedition only she asked a delay of a day or two to equip them and steel herself to the separation staines did not share those vague fears that overpowered the wife whose bitter experiences were unknown to him but he felt uncomfortable at her conditionfor now she was often in tearsand he said all he could to comfort her and he also advised her how to profit by these terrible diamonds in her way he pointed out to her that her farm lay right in the road to the diamonds yet the traffic all shunned her passing twenty miles to the westward said he you should profit by all your resources you have wood a great rarity in africa order a portable forge run up a building where miners can sleep another where they can feed the grain you have so wisely refused to sell grind it into flour dear heart why theres neither wind nor water to turn a mill but there are oxen ill show you how to make an oxmill send your cape cart into cape town for iron lathes for coffee and tea and groceries by the hundredweight the moment you are readyfor success depends on the order in which we actthen prepare great boards and plant them twenty miles south write or paint on them very large the nearest way to the diamond mines through dales kloof where is excellent accommodation for man and beast tea coffee homemade bread fresh butter etc etc do this and you will soon leave off decrying diamonds this is the sure way to coin them i myself take the doubtful way but i cant help it i am a dead man and swift good fortune will give me life you can afford to go the slower road and the surer then he drew her a model of an oxmill and of a miners dormitory the partitions six feet six apart so that these very partitions formed the bedstead the bedsacking being hooked to the uprights he drew his model for twenty bedrooms the portable forge and the oxmill pleased dick dale most but the partitioned bedsteads charmed phoebe she said oh doctor how can one mans head hold so many things if theres a man on earth i can trust my husband with tis you but if things go cross up there promise me you will come back at once and cast in your lot with us we have got money and stock and you have got headpiece we might do very well together indeed indeed we might promise me oh do please promise me i promise you and on this understanding staines and falcon were equipped with rifles pickaxe shovels waterproofs and full saddlebags and started with many shakings of the hand and many tears from phoebe for the diamond washings chapter xxi phoebes tears at parting made staines feel uncomfortable and he said so pooh pooh said falcon crying for nothing does a woman good christopher stared at him falcons spirits rose as they proceeded he was like a boy let loose from school his fluency and charm of manner served however to cheer a singularly dreary journey the travellers soon entered on a vast and forbidding region that wearied the eye at their feet a dull rusty carpet of dried grass and wild camomile with palered sand peeping through the burnt and scanty herbage on the low mounds that looked like heaps of sifted ashes struggled now and then into sickliness a ragged twisted shrub there were flowers too but so sparse that they sparkled vainly in the colorless waste which stretched to the horizon the farmhouses were twenty miles apart and nine out of ten of them were new ones built by the boers since they degenerated into white savages mere huts with domed kitchens behind them in the dwellinghouse the whole family pigged together with raw flesh drying on the rafters stinking skins in a corner parasitical vermin of all sorts blackening the floor and particularly a small biting and odoriferous tortoise compared with which the insect a london washerwoman brings into your house in her basket is a stroke with a featherand all this without the excuse of penury for many of these were shepherd kings sheared four thousand fleeces a year and owned a hundred horses and horned cattle these boers are compelled by unwritten law to receive travellers and water their cattle but our travellers after one or two experiences ceased to trouble them for added to the dirt the men were sullen the women moody silent brainless the whole reception churlish staines detected in them an uneasy consciousness that they had descended in more ways than one from a civilized race and the superior bearing of a european seemed to remind them what they had been and might have been and were not so after an attempt or two our adventurers avoided the boers and tried the kafirs they found the savages socially superior though their moral character does not rank high the kafir cabins they entered were caves lighted only by the door but deliciously cool and quite clean the floors of puddled clay or ants nests and very clean on entering these cool retreats the flies that had tormented them shirked the cool grot and buzzed off to the nearest farm to batten on congenial foulness on the fat round glossy babies not a speck of dirt whereas the little boers were cakes thereof the kafir would meet them at the door his clean black face all smiles and welcome the women and grown girls would fling a spotless handkerchief over their shoulders in a moment and display their snowy teeth in unaffected joy at sight of an englishman at one of these huts one evening they met with something st paul ranks above cleanliness even viz christianity a neighboring lion had just eaten a hottentot faute de mieux and these good kafirs wanted the europeans not to go on at night and be eaten for dessert but they could not speak a word of english and pantomimic expression exists in theory alone in vain the women held our travellers by the coattails and pointed to a distant wood in vain kafir pere went on allfours and growled sore but at last a savage youth ran to the kitchenfor they never cook in the houseand came back with a brand and sketched on the wall of the hut a lion with a mane down to the ground and a saucer eye not loving the creatures paw rested on a hat and coat and another fragment or two of a european the rest was foreshortened or else eaten the picture completed the females looked approved and raised a dismal howl a lion on the road said christopher gravely then the undaunted falcon seized the charcoal and drew an englishman in a theatrical attitude left foot well forward firing a gun and a lion rolling head over heels like a buck rabbit and blood squirting out of a hole in his perforated carcass the savages saw and exulted they were so off their guard as to confound representation with fact they danced round the white warrior and launched him to victory aha said falcon i took the shine out of their lion didnt i you did and once there was a sculptor who showed a lion his marble group a man trampling a lion extracting his tongue and so on but report says it did not convince the lion why no a lion is not an ass but for your comfort there are no lions in this part of the world they are myths there were lions in africa but now they are all at the zoo and i wish i was there too in what characterof a discontented animalwith every blessing they would not take you in too common in england hallo this is something new what lots of bushes we should not have much chance with a lion here there are no lions it is not the zoo said falcon but he spurred on faster the country however did not change its feature bushes and little acacias prevailed and presently dark forms began to glide across at intervals the travellers held their breath and pushed on but at last their horses flagged so they thought it best to stop and light a fire and stand upon their guard they did so and falcon sat with his rifle cocked while staines boiled coffee and they drank it and after two hours halt pushed on and at last the bushes got more scattered and they were on the dreary plain again falcon drew the rein with a sigh of relief and they walked their horses side by side well what has become of the lions said falcon jauntily he turned in his saddle and saw a large animal stealing behind them with its belly to the very earth and eyes hot coals he uttered an eldrich screech fired both barrels with no more aim than a baby and spurred away yelling like a demon the animal fled another way in equal trepidation at those tongues of flame and loud reports and christophers horse reared and plunged and deposited him promptly on the sward but he held the bridle mounted again and rode after his companion a stern chase is a long chase and for that or some other reason he could never catch him again till sunrise being caught he ignored the lioness with cool hauteur he said he had ridden on to find comfortable quarters and craved thanks this was literally the only incident worth recording that the companions met with in three hundred miles on the sixth day out towards afternoon they found by inquiring they were near the diamond washings and the short route was pointed out by an exceptionally civil boer but christophers eye had lighted upon a sort of chain of knolls or little round hills devoid of vegetation and he told falcon he would like to inspect these before going farther oh said the boer they are not on my farm thank goodness they are on my cousin bulteels and he pointed to a large white house about four miles distant and quite off the road nevertheless staines insisted on going to it but first they made up to one of these knolls and examined it it was about thirty feet high and not a vestige of herbage on it the surface was composed of sand and of lumps of gray limestone very hard diversified with lots of quartz mica and other old formations staines got to the top of it with some difficulty and examined the surface all over he came down again and said all these little hills mark hot volcanic actionwhy they are like boiling earthbubbleswhich is the very thing under certain conditions to turn carbonate of lime into diamonds now here is plenty of limestone unnaturally hard and being in a diamond country i can fancy no place more likely to be the matrix than these earthbubbles let us tether the horses and use our shovels they did so and found one or two common crystals and some jasper and a piece of chalcedony all in little bubbles but no diamond falcon said it was wasting time just then the proprietor a gigantic pasty colonist came up with his pipe and stood calmly looking on staines came down and made a sort of apology bulteel smiled quietly and asked what harm they could do him raking that rubbish rake it all avay mine vriends said he ve shall thank you moch he then invited them languidly to his house they went with him and as he volunteered no more remarks they questioned him and learned his father had been a hollander and so had his vrows this accounted for the size and comparative cleanliness of his place it was stuccoed with the lime of the country outside and was four times as large as the miserable farmhouses of the degenerate boers for all this the street door opened on the principal room and that room was kitchen and parlor only very large and wholesome but lord as poor dear pepys used to blurt outto see how some folk understand cleanliness the floor was made of powdered ants nests and smeared with fresh cowdung every day yet these people were the cleanest boers in the colony the vrow met them with a snowwhite collar and cuffs of hamburgh linen and the brats had pasty faces round as pumpkins but shone with soap the vrow was also pastyfaced but gentle and welcomed them with a smile languid but unequivocal the hottentots took their horses as a matter of course their guns were put in a corner a clean cloth was spread and they saw they were to sup and sleep there though the words of invitation were never spoken at supper sundried flesh cabbage and a savory dish the travellers returned to with gusto staines asked what it was the vrow told himlocusts they had stripped her garden and filled her very rooms and fallen in heaps under her walls so she had pressed them by the million into cakes had salted them lightly and stored them and they were excellent baked after supper the accomplished reginald observing a wire guitar tuned it with some difficulty and so twanged it and sang ditties to it that the flabby giants pasty face wore a look of dreamy content over his everlasting pipe and in the morning after a silent breakfast he said mine vriends stay here a year or two and rake in mine rubbish ven you are tired here are springbok and antelopes and you can shoot mit your rifles and ve vil cook them and you shall zing us zongs of vaderland they thanked him heartily and said they would stay a few days at all events the placid boer went afarming and the pair shouldered their pick and shovel and worked on their heap all day and found a number of pretty stones but no diamond come said falcon we must go to the river and staines acquiesced i bow to experience said he at the threshold they found two of the little bulteels playing with pieces of quartz crystal etc on the doorstone one of these stones caught stainess eye directly it sparkled in a different way from the others he examined it it was the size of a white haricot bean and one side of it polished by friction he looked at it and looked and saw that it refracted the light he felt convinced it was a diamond give the boy a penny for it said the ingenious falcon on receiving the information oh said staines take advantage of a child he borrowed it of the boy and laid it on the table after supper sir said he this is what we were raking in your kopjes for and could not find it it belongs to little hans will you sell it us we are not experts but we think it may be a diamond we will risk ten pounds on it ten pounds said the farmer nay we rob not travellers mine vriend but if it is a diamond it is worth a hundred see how it gains fire in the dusk in short they forced the ten pounds on him and next day went to work on another kopje but the simple farmers conscience smote him it was a slack time so he sent four hotteatots with shovels to help these friendly maniacs these worked away gayly and the white men set up a sorting table and sorted the stuff and hammered the nodules and at last found a little stone as big as a pea that refracted the light staines showed this to the hottentots and their quick eyes discovered two more that day only smaller next day nothing but a splinter or two then staines determined to dig deeper contrary to the general impression he gave his reason diamonds dont fall from the sky they work up from the ground and clearly the heat must be greater farther down acting on this they tried the next strata but found it entirely barren after that however they came to a fresh layer of carbonate and here falcon hammering a large lump of conglomerate out leaped all of a sudden a diamond big as a nut that ran along the earth gleaming like a star it had polished angles and natural facets and even a novice with an eye in his head could see it was a diamond of the purest water staines and falcon shouted with delight and made the blacks a present on the spot they showed the prize at night and begged the farmer to take to digging there was ten times more money beneath his soil than on it not he he was a farmer did not believe in diamonds two days afterwards another great find seven small diamonds next day a stone as large as a cobnut and with strange and beautiful streaks they carried it home to dinner and set it on the table and told the family it was worth a thousand pounds bulteel scarcely looked at it but the vrow trembled and all the young folk glowered at it in the middle of dinner it exploded like a cracker and went literally into diamonddust dere goes von tousand pounds said bulteel without moving a muscle falcon swore but staines showed fortitude it was laminated said he and exposure to the air was fatal owing to the invaluable assistance of the hottentots they had in less than a month collected four large stones of pure water and a wineglassful of small stones when one fine day going to work calmly after breakfast they found some tents pitched and at least a score of dirty diggers bearded like the pard at work on the ground staines sent falcon back to tell bulteel and suggest that he should at once order them off or better still make terms with them the phlegmatic boer did neither in twentyfour hours it was too late the place was rushed in other words diggers swarmed to the spot with no idea of law but diggers law a thousand tents rose like mushrooms and poor bulteel stood smoking and staring amazed at his own door and saw a veritable procession of wagons cape carts and powdered travellers file past him to take possession of his hillocks him the proprietor they simply ignored they had a committee who were to deal with all obstructions landlords and tenants included they themselves measured out bulteels farm into thirtyfoot claims and went to work with shovel and pick they held stainess claim sacredthat was diggers law but they confined it strictly to thirty feet square had the friends resisted their brains would have been knocked out however they gained this that dealers poured in and the market not being yet glutted the price was good staines sold a few of the small stones for two hundred pounds he showed one of the larger stones the dealers eye glittered but he offered only three hundred pounds and this was so wide of the ascending scale on which a stone of that importance is priced that staines reserved it for sale at cape town nevertheless he afterwards doubted whether he had not better have taken it for the multitude of diggers turned out such a prodigious number of diamonds at bulteels pan that a sort of panic fell on the market these dry diggings were a revelation to the world men began to think the diamond perhaps was a commoner stone than any one had dreamed it to be as to the discovery of stones staines and falcon lost nothing by being confined to a thirtyfoot claim compelled to dig deeper they got into a rich strata where they found garnets by the pint and some small diamonds and at last one lucky day their largest diamond it weighed thirtyseven carats and was a rich yellow now when a diamond is clouded or off color it is terribly depreciated but a diamond with a positive color is called a fancy stone and ranks with the purest stones i wish i had this in cape town said staines why ill take it to cape town if you like said the changeable falcon you will said christopher surprised why not im not much of a digger i can serve our interest better by selling i could get a thousand pounds for this at cape town we will talk of that quietly said christopher now the fact is falcon as a digger was not worth a pin he could not sort his eyes would not bear the blinding glare of a tropical sun upon lime and dazzling bits of mica quartz crystal white topaz etc in the midst of which the true glint of the royal stone had to be caught in a moment he could not sort and he had not the heart to dig the only way to make him earn his half was to turn him into the travelling and selling partner christopher was too generous to tell him this but he acted on it and said he thought his was an excellent proposal indeed he had better take all the diamonds they had got to dales kloof first and show them to his wife for her consolation and perhaps said he in a matter of this importance she will go to cape town with you and try the market there all right said falcon he sat and brooded over the matter a long time and said why make two bites of a cherry they will only give us half the value at cape town why not go by the steamer to england before the london market is glutted and all the world finds out that diamonds are as common as dirt go to england what without your wife ill never be a party to that me part man and wife if you knew my own story why who wants you said reginald you dont understand phoebe is dying to visit england again but she has got no excuse if you like to give her one she will be much obliged to you i can tell you oh that is a very different matter if mrs falcon can leave her farm oh that brute of a brother of hers is a very honest fellow for that matter she can trust the farm to him besides it is only a months voyage by the mail steamer this suggestion of falcons set christophers heart bounding and his eyes glistening but he restrained himself and said this takes me by surprise let me smoke a pipe over it he not only did that but he lay awake all night the fact is that for some time past christopher had felt sharp twinges of conscience and deep misgivings as to the course he had pursued in leaving his wife a single day in the dark complete convalescence had cleared his moral sentiments and perhaps after all the discovery of the diamonds had cooperated since now the insurance money was no longer necessary to keep his wife from starving ah said he faith is a great quality and how i have lacked it to do him justice he knew his wifes excitable nature and was not without fears of some disaster should the news be communicated to her unskilfully but this proposal of falcons made the way clearer mrs falcon though not a lady had all a ladys delicacy and all a womans tact and tenderness he knew no one in the world more fit to be trusted with the delicate task of breaking to his rosa that the grave for once was baffled and her husband lived he now became quite anxious for falcons departure and ardently hoped that worthy had not deceived himself as to mrs falcons desire to visit england in short it was settled that falcon should start for dales kloof taking with him the diamonds believed to be worth altogether three thousand pounds at cape town and nearly as much again in england and a long letter to mrs falcon in which staines revealed his true story told her where to find his wife or hear of her viz at kent villa gravesend and sketched an outline of instructions as to the way and cunning degrees by which the joyful news should be broken to her with this he sent a long letter to be given to rosa herself but not till she should know all and in this letter he enclosed the ruby ring she had given him that ring had never left his finger by sea or land in sickness or health the letter to rosa was sealed the two letters made quite a packet for in the letter to his beloved rosa he told her everything that had befallen him it was a romance and a picture of love a letter to lift a loving woman to heaven and almost reconcile her to all her bereaved heart had suffered this letter written with many tears from the heart that had so suffered and was now softened by good fortune and bounding with joy staines entrusted to falcon together with the other diamonds and with many warm shakings of the hand started him on his way but mind falcon said christopher i shall expect an answer from mrs falcon in twenty days at farthest i do not feel so sure as you do that she wants to go to england and if not i must write to uncle philip give me your solemn promise old fellow an answer in twenty daysif you have to send a kafir on horseback i give you my honor said falcon superbly send it to me at bulteels farm all right dr christie bulteels farm wellno why should i conceal my real name any longer from such friends as you and your wife christie is short for christopherthat is my christian name but my surname is staines write to dr staines dr staines yes did you ever hear of me falcon wore a strange look i almost think i have down at gravesend or somewhere that is curious yes i married my rosa there poor thing god bless her god comfort her she thinks me dead his voice trembled he grasped falcons cold hand till the latter winced again and so they parted and falcon rode off muttering dr staines so then you are dr staines chapter xxii rosa staines had youth on her side and it is an old saying that youth will not be denied youth struggled with death for her and won the battle but she came out of that terrible fight weak as a child the sweet pale face the widows cap the suit of deep blackit was long ere these came down from the sickroom and when they did oh the dead blank the weary listless life the days spent in sighs and tears and desolation solitude solitude her husband was gone and a strange woman played the mother to her child before her eyes uncle philip was devotedly kind to her and so was her father but they could do nothing for her months rolled on and skinned the wound over months could not heal her boy became dearer and dearer and it was from him came the first real drops of comfort however feeble she used to read her lost ones diary every day and worship in deep sorrow the mind she had scarcely respected until it was too late she searched in his diary to find his will and often she mourned that he had written on it so few things she could obey her desire to obey the dead whom living she had often disobeyed was really simple and touching she would mourn to her father that there were so few commands to her in his diary but said she memory brings me back his will in many things and to obey is now the only sad comfort i have it was in this spirit she now forced herself to keep accounts no fear of her wearing stays now no powder no trimmings no waste after the usual delay her father told her she should instruct a solicitor to apply to the insurance company for the six thousand pounds she refused with a burst of agony the price of his life she screamed never id live on bread and water sooner than touch that vile money her father remonstrated gently but she was immovable no it would be like consenting to his death then uncle philip was sent for he set her child on her knee and gave her a pen come said he sternly be a woman and do your duty to little christie she kissed the boy cried and did her duty meekly but when the money was brought her she flew to uncle philip and said there there and threw it all before him and cried as if her heart would break he waited patiently and asked her what he was to do with all that invest it yes yes for my little christie and pay you the interest quarterly oh no no dribble us out a little as we want it that is the way to be truly kind to a simpleton i hate that word and suppose i run off with it such confiding geese as you corrupt a man i shall never corrupt you crusty people are the soul of honor crusty people cried philip affecting amazement what are they she bit her lip and colored a little but answered adroitly they are people that pretend not to have good hearts but have the best in the world far better ones than your smooth ones thats crusty people very well said philip and ill tell you what simpletons are they are little transparentlooking creatures that look shallow but are as deep as old nick and make you love them in spite of your judgment they are the most artful of their sex for they always achieve its great object to be lovedthe very thing that clever women sometimes fail in well and if we are not to be loved why live at allsuch useless things as i am said rosa simply so philip took charge of her money and agreed to help her save money for her little christopher poverty should never destroy him as it had his father as months rolled on she crept out into public a little but always on foot and a very little way from home youth and sober life gradually restored her strength but not her color nor her buoyancy yet she was perhaps more beautiful than ever for a holy sorrow chastened and sublimed her features it was now a sweet angelic pensive beauty that interested every feeling person at a glance she would visit no one but a twelvemonth after her bereavement she received a few chosen visitors one day a young gentleman called and sent up his card lord tadcaster with a note from lady cicely treherne full of kindly feeling uncle philip had reconciled her to lady cicely but they had never met mrs staines was much agitated at the very name of lord tadcaster but she would not have missed seeing him for the world she received him with her beautiful eyes wide open to drink in every lineament of one who had seen the last of her christopher tadcaster was wonderfully improved he had grown six inches out at sea and though still short was not diminutive he was a small apollo a model of symmetry and had an engaging girlish beauty redeemed from downright effeminacy by a golden mustache like silk and a tanned cheek that became him wonderfully he seemed dazzled at first by mrs staines but murmured that lady cicely had told him to come or he would not have ventured who can be so welcome to me as you said she and the tears came thick in her eyes directly soon he hardly knew how he found himself talking of staines and telling her what a favorite he was and all the clever things he had done the tears streamed down her cheeks but she begged him to go on telling her and omit nothing he complied heartily and was even so moved by the telling of his friends virtues and her tears and sobs that he mingled his tears with hers she rewarded him by giving him her hand as she turned away her tearful face to indulge the fresh burst of grief his sympathy evoked when he was leaving she said in her simple way bless youcome again she said you have done a poor widow good lord tadcaster was so interested and charmed he would gladly have come back next day to see her but he restrained that extravagance and waited a week then he visited her again he had observed the villa was not rich in flowers and he took her down a magnificent bouquet cut from his fathers hothouses at sight of him or at sight of it or both the color rose for once in her pale cheek and her pensive face wore a sweet expression of satisfaction she took his flowers and thanked him for them and for coming to see her soon they got on the only topic she cared for and in the course of this second conversation he took her into his confidence and told her he owed everything to dr staines i was on the wrong road altogether and he put me right to tell you the truth i used to disobey him now and then while he was alive and i was always the worse for it now he is gone i never disobey him i have written down a lot of wise kind things he said to me and i never go against any one of them i call it my book of oracles dear me i might have brought it with me oh yes why didnt you rather reproachfully i will bring it next time pray do then she looked at him with her lovely swimming eyes and said tenderly and so here is another that disobeyed him living but obeys him dead what will you think when i tell you that i his wife who now worship him when it is too late often thwarted and vexed him when he was alive no no he told me you were an angel and i believe it an angel a goodfornothing foolish woman who sees everything too late nobody else should say so before me said the little gentleman grandly i shall take his word before yours on this one subject if ever there was an angel you are one and oh what would i give if i could but say or do anything in the world to comfort you you can do nothing for me dear but come and see me often and talk to me as you doon the one sad theme my broken heart has room for this invitation delighted lord tadcaster and the sweet word dear from her lovely lips entered his heart and ran through all his veins like some rapturous but dangerous elixir he did not say to himself she is a widow with a child feels old with grief and looks on me as a boy who has been kind to her such prudence and wariness were hardly to be expected from his age he had admired her at first sight very nearly loved her at their first interview and now this sweet word opened a heavenly vista the generous heart that beat in his small frame burned to console her with a lifelong devotion and all the sweet offices of love he ordered his yacht to gravesendfor he had become a sailorand then he called on mrs staines and told her with a sort of sheepish cunning that now as his yacht happened to be at gravesend he could come and see her very often he watched her timidly to see how she would take that proposition she said with the utmost simplicity im very glad of it then he produced his oracles and she devoured them such precepts to tadcaster as she could apply to her own case she instantly noted in her memory and they became her law from that moment then in her simplicity she said and i will show you some things in his own handwriting that may be good for you but i cant show you the whole book some of it is sacred from every eye but his wifes his wifes ah me his widows then she pointed out passages in the diary that she thought might be for his good and he nestled to her side and followed her white finger with loving eyes and was in an elysiumwhich she would certainly have put a stop to at that time had she divined it but all wisdom does not come at once to an unguarded woman rosa staines was wiser about her husband than she had been but she had plenty to learn lord tadcaster anchored off gravesend and visited mrs staines nearly every day she received him with a pleasure that was not at all lively but quite undisguised he could not doubt his welcome for once when he came she said to the servant not at home a plain proof she did not wish his visit to be cut short by any one else and so these visits and devoted attentions of every kind went on unobserved by lord tadcasters friends because rosa would never go out even with him but at last mr lusignan saw plainly how this would end unless he interfered well he did not interfere on the contrary he was careful to avoid putting his daughter on her guard he said to himself lord tadcaster does her good im afraid she would not marry him if he was to ask her now but in time she might she likes him a great deal better than any one else as for philip he was abroad for his own health somewhat impaired by his long and faithful attendance on rosa so now lord tadcaster was in constant attendance on rosa she was languid but gentle and kind and as mourners like invalids are apt to be egotistical she saw nothing but that he was a comfort to her in her affliction while matters were so the earl of miltshire who had long been sinking died and tadcaster succeeded to his honors and estates rosa heard of it and thinking it was a great bereavement wrote him one of those exquisite letters of condolence a lady alone can write he took it to lady cicely and showed it her she highly approved it he said the only thingit makes me ashamed i do not feel my poor fathers death more but you know it has been so long expected then he was silent a long time and then he asked her if such a woman as that would not make him happy if he could win her it was on her ladyships tongue to say she did not make her first happy but she forbore and said coldly that was maw than she could say tadcaster seemed disappointed by that and by and by cicely took herself to task she asked herself what were tadcasters chances in the lottery of wives the heavy army of scheming mothers and the light cavalry of artful daughters rose before her cousinly and disinterested eyes and she asked herself what chance poor little tadcaster would have of catching a true love with a hundred female artists manoeuvring wheeling ambuscading and charging upon his wealth and titles she returned to the subject of her own accord and told him she saw but one objection to such a match the lady had a son by a man of rare merit and misfortune could he at his age undertake to be a father to that son othahwise said lady cicely mark my words you will quall over that poor child and you will have two to quall with because i shall be on her side tadcaster declared to her that child should be quite the opposite of a bone of contention i have thought of that said he and i mean to be so kind to that boy i shall make her love me for that on these terms lady cicely gave her consent then he asked her should he write or ask her in person lady cicely reflected if you write i think she will say no but if i go then it will depend on how you do it rosa staines is a true mourner whatever you may think i dont believe the idea of a second union has ever entered her head but then she is very unselfish and she likes you better than any one else i dare say i dont think your title or your money will weigh with her now but if you show her your happiness depends on it she may perhaps cwy and sob at the very idea of it and then after all say well why notif i can make the poor soul happy so on this advice tadcaster went down to gravesend and lady cicely felt a certain selfsatisfaction for her wellmeant interference having lost rosa one husband she was pleased to think she had done something to give her another lord tadcaster came to rosa staines he found her seated with her head upon her white hand thinking sadly of the past at sight of him in deep mourning she started and said oh then she said tenderly we are of one color now and gave him her hand he sat down beside her not knowing how to begin i am not tadcaster now i am earl of miltshire ah yes i forgot said she indifferently this is my first visit to any one in that character thank you it is an awfully important visit to me i could not feel myself independent and able to secure your comfort and little christies without coming to the lady the only lady i ever saw thatoh mrs stainesrosawho could see you as i have donemingle his tears with yours as i have done and not love you and long to offer you his love love to me a brokenhearted woman with nothing to live for but his memory and his child she looked at him with a sort of scared amazement his child shall be mine his memory is almost as dear to me as to you nonsense child nonsense said she almost sternly was he not my best friend should i have the health i enjoy or even be alive but for him oh mrs stainesrosa you will not live all your life unmarried and who will love you as i do you are my first and only love my happiness depends on you your happiness depend on me heaven forbida woman of my age that feels so old old old you are not old you are young and sad and beautiful and my happiness depends on you she began to tremble a little then he kneeled at her knees and implored her and his hot tears fell upon the hand she put out to stop him while she turned her head away and the tears began to run oh never can the cold dissecting pen tell what rushes over the heart that has loved and lost when another true love first kneels and implores for love or pity or anything the bereaved can give chapter xxiii when falcon went luck seemed to desert their claim day after day went by without a find and the discoveries on every side made this the more mortifying by this time the diggers at bulteels pan were as miscellaneous as the audience at drury lane theatre only mixed more closely the gallery folk and the stalls worked cheek by jowl here a gentleman with an affected lisp and close by an honest fellow who could not deliver a sentence without an oath or some still more horrible expletive that meant nothing at all in reality but served to make respectable flesh creep interspersed with these hottentots kafirs and wild blue blacks gayly clad in an ostrich feather a scarlet ribbon and a tower musket sold them by some good christian for a modern rifle on one side of staines were two swells who lay on their backs and talked opera half the day but seldom condescended to work without finding a diamond of some sort after a weeks deplorable luck his kafir boy struck work on account of a sore in his leg the sore was due to a very common cause the burning sand had got into a scratch and festered staines out of humanity examined the sore and proceeding to clean it before bandaging out popped a diamond worth forty pounds even in the depreciated market staines quietly pocketed it and bandaged the leg this made him suspect his blacks had been cheating him on a large scale and he borrowed hans bulteel to watch them giving him a third with which master hans was mightily pleased but they could only find small diamonds and by this time prodigious slices of luck were reported on every side kafirs and boers that would not dig but traversed large tracts of ground when the sun was shining stumbled over diamonds one boer pointed to a wagon and eight oxen and said that one lucky glance on the sand had given him that lot but day after day staines returned home covered with dust and almost blinded yet with little or nothing to show for it one evening complaining of his change of luck bulteel quietly proposed to him migration i am going said he resignedly and you can come with me you leave your farm sir why they pay you ten shillings a claim and that must make a large return the pan is fifteen acres yes mine vriend said the poor hollander they pay but deir money it cost too dear vere is mine peace dis farm is six tousand acres if de cursed diamonds was farther off den it vas vell but dey are too near

but i vill i have said i shall tink of it dat is my vay so i say yah an english company they will cheat you without mercy no they shall not though for i will have a hand in the bargain he set to work directly added up the value of the claims at ten shillings per month and amazed the poor hollander by his statement of the value of those fifteen acres capitalized and to close this part of the subject the obnoxious diamonds obtained him three times as much as his father had given for the whole six thousand acres the company got a great bargain but bulteel received what for him was a large capital and settling far to the south this lineal descendant of le philosophe sans savoir carried his godliness his cleanliness and his love of peace out of the turmoil and was happier than ever since now he could compare his placid existence with one year of noise and clamor but long before this events more pertinent to my story had occurred one day a hottentot came into bulteels farm and went out among the diggers till he found staines the hottentot was one employed at dales kloof and knew him he brought staines a letter staines opened the letter and another letter fell out it was directed to reginald falcon esq why thought staines what a time this letter must have been on the road so much for private messengers the letter ran thus dear sirthis leaves us all well at dales kloof as i hope it shall find you and my dear husband at the diggings sir i am happy to say i have good news for you when you got well by gods mercy i wrote to the doctor at the hospital and told him so i wrote unbeknown to you because i had promised him well sir he has written back to say you have two hundred pounds in money and a great many valuable things such as gold and jewels they are all at the old bank in cape town and the cashier has seen you and will deliver them on demand so that is the first of my good news because it is good news to you but dear sir i think you will be pleased to hear that dick and i are thriving wonderfully thanks to your good advice the wooden house it is built and a great oven but sir the traffic came almost before we were ready and the miners that call here coming

dutiful servant and friend phoebe dale ps there is regular travelling to and from cape town and a post now to pniel but i thought it surest to send by one that knows you staines read this letter with great satisfaction he remembered his two hundred pounds but his gold and jewels puzzled him still it was good news and pleased him not a little phoebes good fortune gratified him too and her offer of a partnership especially in the purchase of diamonds from returning diggers he saw a large fortune to be made and wearied and disgusted with recent illluck bleareyed and almost blinded with sorting in the blazing sun he resolved to go at once to dales kloof should mrs falcon be gone to england with the diamonds he would stay there and rosa should come out to him or he would go and fetch her he went home and washed himself and told bulteel he had had good news and should leave the diggings at once he gave him up the claim and told him to sell it by auction it was worth two hundred pounds still the good people sympathized with him and he started within an hour he left his pickaxe and shovel and took only his double rifle an admirable one some ammunition including conical bullets and projectile shells given him by falcon a bag full of carbuncles and garnets he had collected for ucatella a few small diamonds and one hundred poundsall that remained to him since he had been paying wages and other things for months and had given falcon twenty for his journey he rode away and soon put twenty miles between him and the diggings he came to a little store that bought diamonds and sold groceries and tobacco he haltered his horse to a hook and went in he offered a small diamond for sale the master was out and the assistant said there was a glut of these small stones he did not care to give money for it well give me three dozen cigars while they were chaffering in walked a hottentot and said will you buy this and laid a clear glittering stone on the counter as large as a walnut yes said the young man how much two hundred pounds two hundred pounds let us look at it he examined it and said he thought it was a diamond but these large stones were so deceitful he dared not give two hundred pounds come again in an hour said he then the master will be in no said the hottentot quietly and walked out staines who had been literally perspiring at the sight of this stone mounted his horse and followed the man when he came up to him he asked leave to examine the gem the hottentot quietly assented staines looked at it all over it had a rough side and a polished side and the latter was of amazing softness and lustre it made him tremble he said look here i have only one hundred pounds in my pocket the hottentot shook his head but if you will go back with me to bulteels farm ill borrow the other hundred the hottentot declined and told him he could get four hundred pounds for it by going back to pniel but said he my face is turned so and when squat turn his face so he going home not can bear go the other way then and he held out his hand for the diamond staines gave it him and was in despair at seeing such a prize so near yet leaving him he made one more effort well but said he how far are you going this way ten days why so am i come with me to dales kloof and i will give the other hundred see i am in earnest for here is one hundred at all events staines made this proposal trembling with excitement to his surprise and joy the hottentot assented though with an air of indifference and on these terms they became fellowtravellers and staines gave him a cigar they went on side by side and halted for the night forty miles from bulteels farm they slept in a boers outhouse and the vrow was civil and lent staines a jackals skin in the morning he bought it for a diamond a carbuncle and a score of garnets for a horrible thought had occurred to him if they stopped at any place where miners were somebody might buy the great diamond over his head this fear and others grew on him and with all his philosophy he went on thorns and was the slave of the diamond he resolved to keep his hottentot all to himself if possible he shot a springbok that crossed the road and they roasted a portion of the animal and the hottentot carried some on with him seeing he admired the rifle staines offered it him for the odd hundred pounds but though squats eye glittered a moment he declined finding that they met too many diggers and carts staines asked his hottentot was there no nearer way to reach that star pointing to one he knew was just over dales kloof oh yes he knew a nearer way where there were trees and shade and grass and many beasts to shoot let us take that way said staines the hottentot ductile as wax except about the price of the diamond assented calmly and next day they diverged and got into forest scenery and their eyes were soothed with green glades here and there wherever the clumps of trees sheltered the grass from the panting sun animals abounded and were tame staines an excellent marksman shot the hottentot his supper without any trouble sleeping in the wood with not a creature near but squat a sombre thought struck staines suppose this hottentot should assassinate him for his money who would ever know the thought was horrible and he awoke with a start ten times that night the hottentot slept like a stone and never feared for his own life and precious booty staines was compelled to own to himself he had less faith in human goodness than the savage had he said to himself he is my superior he is the master of this dreadful diamond and i am its slave next day they went on till noon and then they halted at a really delightful spot a silver kloof ran along a bottom and there was a little clump of three acaciatrees that lowered their long tresses pining for the stream and sometimes getting a cool grateful kiss from it when the water was high they halted the horse bathed in the stream and lay luxurious under the acacias all was delicious languor and enjoyment of life the hottentot made a fire and burnt the remains of a little sort of kangaroo staines had shot him the evening before but it did not suffice his maw and looking about him he saw three elands leisurely feeding about three hundred yards off they were cropping the rich herbage close to the shelter of a wood the hottentot suggested that this was an excellent opportunity he would borrow stainess rifle steal into the wood crawl on his belly close up to them and send a bullet through one staines did not relish the proposal he had seen the savages eye repeatedly gloat on the rifle and was not without hopes he might even yet relent and give the great diamond for the hundred pounds and this rifle and he was so demoralized by the diamond and filled with suspicion that he feared the savage if he once had the rifle in his possession might levant and be seen no more in which case he staines still the slave of the diamond might hang himself on the nearest tree and so secure his rosa the insurance money at all events in short he had really diamond on the brain he hemd and hawd a little at squats proposal and then got out of it by saying that is not necessary i can shoot it from here it is too far objected blacky too far this is an enfield rifle i could kill the poor beast at three times that distance blacky was amazed an enfield rifle said he in the soft musical murmur of his tribe which is the one charm of the poor hottentot and shoot three times so far yes said christopher then seeing his companions hesitation he conceived a hope if i kill that eland from here will you give me the diamond for my horse and the wonderful rifleno hottentot has such a rifle squat became cold directly the price of the diamond is two hundred pounds staines groaned with disappointment and thought to himself with rage anybody but me would club the rifle give the obstinate black brute a stunner and take the diamondgod forgive me says the hottentot cunningly i cant think so far as white man let me see the eland dead and then i shall know how far the rifle shoot very well said staines but he felt sure the savage only wanted his meal and would never part with the diamond except for the odd money however he loaded his left barrel with one of the explosive projectiles falcon had given him it was a little fulminating shell with a steel point it was with this barrel he had shot the murcat overnight and he had found he shot better with this barrel than the other he loaded his left barrel then saw the powder well up capped it and cut away a strip of the acacia with his knife to see clear and lying down in volunteer fashion elbow on ground drew his bead steadily on an eland who presented him her broadside her back being turned to the wood the sun shone on her soft coat and never was a fairer mark the sportsmans deadly eye being in the cool shade the animal in the sun he aimed long and steadily but just as he was about to pull the trigger mind interposed and he lowered the deadly weapon poor creature he said i am going to take her lifefor what for a single meal she is as big as a pony and i am to lay her carcass on the plain that we may eat two pounds of it this is how the weasel kills the rabbit sucks an ounce of blood for his food and wastes the rest so the demoralized sheepdog tears out the poor creatures kidneys and wastes the rest man armed by science with such powers of slaying should be less egotistical than weasels and perverted sheepdogs i will not kill her i will not lay that beautiful body of hers low and glaze those tender loving eyes that never gleamed with hate or rage at man and fix those innocent jaws that never bit the life out of anything not even of the grass she feeds on and does it more good than harm feed on poor innocent and you be blanked you and your diamond that i begin to wish i had never seen for it would corrupt an angel squat understood one word in ten but he managed to reply this is nonsensetalk said he gravely the life is no bigger in that than in the murcat you shot last shoot no more it is said staines i am a fool it is come to this then kafirs teach us theology and hottentots morality i bow to my intellectual superior ill shoot the eland he raised his rifle again no no no no no no murmured the hottentot in a sweet voice scarcely audible yet so keen in its entreaty that staines turned hastily round to look at him his face was ashy his teeth chattering his limbs shaking before staines could ask him what was the matter he pointed through an aperture of the acacias into the wood hard by the elands staines looked and saw what seemed to him like a very long dog or some such animal crawling from tree to tree he did not at all share the terror of his companion nor understand it but a terrible explanation followed this creature having got to the skirt of the wood expanded by some strange magic to an incredible size and sprang into the open with a growl a mighty lion he seemed to ricochet from the ground so immense was his second bound that carried him to the eland and he struck her one blow on the head with his terrible paw and felled her as if with a thunderbolt down went her body with all the legs doubled and her poor head turned over and the nose kissed the ground the lion stood motionless presently the eland who was not dead but stunned began to recover and struggle feebly up then the lion sprang on her with a roar and rolled her over and with two tremendous bites and a shake tore her entrails out and laid her dying he sat composedly down and contemplated her last convulsions without touching her again at this roar though not loud the horse though he had never heard or seen a lion trembled and pulled at his halter blacky crept into the water and staines was struck with such an awe as he had never felt nevertheless the king of beasts being at a distance and occupied and staines a brave man and out of sight he kept his ground and watched and by those means saw a sight never to be forgotten the lion rose up and stood in the sun incredibly beautiful as well as terrible he was not the mangy hue of the caged lion but a skin tawny golden glossy as a racehorse and of exquisite tint that shone like pure gold in the sun his eye a lustrous jewel of richest hue and his mane sublime he looked towards the wood and uttered a full roar this was so tremendous that the horse shook all over as if in an ague and began to lather staines recoiled and his flesh crept and the hottentot went under water and did not emerge for ever so long after a pause the lion roared again and all the beasts and birds of prey seemed to know the meaning of that terrible roar till then the place had been a solitude but now it began to fill in the strangest way as if the lord of the forest could call all his subjects together with a trumpet roar first came two lion cubs to whom in fact the roar had been addressed the lion rubbed himself several times against the eland but did not eat a morsel and the cubs went in and feasted on the prey the lion politely and paternally drew back and watched the young people enjoying themselves meantime approached on tiptoe jackals and hyenas but dared not come too near slatecolored vultures settled at a little distance but not a soul dared interfere with the cubs they saw the lion was acting sentinel and they knew better than come near after a time papa feared for the digestion of those brats or else his own mouth watered for he came up knocked them head over heels with his velvet paw and they took the gentle hint and ran into the wood double quick then the lion began tearing away at the eland and bolting huge morsels greedily this made the rabbles mouth water the hyenas and jackals and vultures formed a circle ludicrous to behold and that circle kept narrowing as the lion tore away at his prey they increased in number and at last hunger overcame prudence the rear rank shoved on the front as amongst men and a general attack seemed imminent then the lion looked up at these invaders uttered a reproachful growl and went at them patting them right and left and knocking them over he never touched a vulture nor indeed did he kill an animal he was a lion and only killed to eat yet he soon cleared the place because he knocked over a few hyenas and jackals and the rest being active tumbled over the vultures before they could spread their heavy wings after this warning they made a respectful circle again through which in due course the gorged lion stalked into the wood a savages sentiments change quickly and the hottentot fearing little from a full lion was now giggling at stainess side staines asked him which he thought was the lord of all creatures a man or a lion a lion said blacky amazed at such a shallow question staines now got up and proposed to continue their journey but blacky was for waiting till the lion was gone to sleep after his meal while they discussed the question the lion burst out of the wood within hearing of their voices as his prickedup ears showed and made straight for them at a distance of scarcely thirty yards now the chances are the lion knew nothing about them and only came to drink at the kloof after his meal and perhaps lie under the acacias but who can think calmly when his first lion bursts out on him a few paces off staines shouldered his rifle took a hasty flurried aim and sent a bullet at him if he had missed him perhaps the report might have turned the lion but he wounded him and not mortally instantly the enraged beast uttered a terrific roar and came at him with his mane distended with rage his eyes glaring his mouth open and his whole body dilated with fury at that terrible moment staines recovered his wits enough to see that what little chance he had was to fire into the destroyer not at him he kneeled and levelled at the centre of the lions chest and not till he was within five yards did he fire through the smoke he saw the lion in the air above him and rolled shrieking into the stream and crawled like a worm under the bank by one motion and there lay trembling a few seconds of sick stupor passed all was silent had the lion lost him was it possible he might yet escape all was silent he listened in agony for the sniffing of the lion puzzling him out by scent no all was silent staines looked round and saw a woolly head and two saucer eyes and open nostrils close by him it was the hottentot more dead than alive staines whispered him i think he is gone the hottentot whispered gone a little way to watch he is wise as well as strong with this he disappeared beneath the water still no sound but the screaming of the vultures and snarling of the hyenas and jackals over the eland take a look said staines yes said squat but not today wait here a day or two den he forget and forgive now staines having seen the lion lie down and watch the dying eland was a great deal impressed by this and as he had now good hopes of saving his life he would not throw away a chance he kept his head just above water and never moved in this freezing situation they remained presently there was a rustling that made both crouch it was followed by a croaking noise christopher made himself small the hottentot on the contrary raised his head and ventured a little way into the stream by these means he saw it was something very foul but not terrible it was a large vulture that had settled on the very top of the nearest acacia at this the hottentot got bolder still and to the great surprise of staines began to crawl cautiously into some rushes and through them up the bank the next moment he burst into a mixture of yelling and chirping and singing and other sounds so manifestly jubilant that the vulture flapped heavily away and staines emerged in turn but very cautiously could he believe his eyes there lay the lion dead as a stone on his back with his four legs in the air like wooden legs they were so very dead and the valiant squat dancing about him and on him and over him staines unable to change his sentiments so quickly eyed even the dead body of the royal beast with awe and wonder what had he already laid that terrible monarch low and with a tube made in a london shop by men who never saw a lion spring nor heard his awful roar shake the air he stood with his heart still beating and said not a word the shallow hottentot whipped out a large knife and began to skin the king of beasts staines wondered he could so profane that masterpiece of nature he felt more inclined to thank god for so great a preservation and then pass reverently on and leave the dead king undesecrated he was roused from his solemn thoughts by the reflection that there might be a lioness about since there were cubs he took a piece of paper emptied his remaining powder into it and proceeded to dry it in the sun this was soon done and then he loaded both barrels by this time the adroit hottentot had flayed the carcass sufficiently to reveal the mortal injury the projectile had entered the chest and slanting upwards had burst among the vitals reducing them to a gory pulp the lion must have died in the air when he bounded on receiving the fatal shot the hottentot uttered a cry of admiration not the lion king of all nor even the white man he said but enfeel rifle stainess eyes glittered you shall have it and the horse for your diamond said he eagerly the black seemed a little shaken but did not reply he got out of it by going on with his lion and staines eyed him and was bitterly disappointed at not getting the diamond even on these terms he began to feel he should never get it they were near the highroad he could not keep the hottentot to himself much longer he felt sick at heart he had wild and wicked thoughts half hoped the lioness would come and kill the hottentot and liberate the jewel that possessed his soul at last the skin was off and the hottentot said me take this to my kraal and dey all say squat a great shooter kill um lion then staines saw another chance for him and summoned all his address for a last effort no squat said he that skin belongs to me i shot the lion with the only rifle that can kill a lion like a cat yet you would not give me a diamonda paltry stone for it no squat if you were to go into your village with that lions skin why the old men would bend their heads to you and say great is squat he killed the lion and wears his skin the young women would all fight which should be the wife of squat squat would be king of the village squats eyes began to roll and shall i give the skin and the glory that is my due to an illnatured fellow who refuses me his paltry diamond for a good horselook at himand for the rifle that kills lions like rabbitsbehold it and a hundred pounds in good gold and dutch notessee and for the lions skin and glory and honor and a rich wife and to be king of africa never the hottentots hands and toes began to work convulsively good master squat ask pardon squat was blind squat will give the diamond the great diamond of africa for the lions skin and the king rifle and the little horse and the gold and dutch notes every one of them dat make just two hundred pounds more like four hundred cried staines very loud and how do i know it is a diamond these large stones are the most deceitful show it me this instant said he imperiously iss master said the crushed hottentot with the voice of a mouse and put the stone into his hand with a childlike faith that almost melted staines but he saw he must be firm where did you find it he bawled master said poor squat in deprecating tones my little master at the farm wanted plaster he send to bulteels pan dere was large lumps squat say to miners may we take de large lumps dey say yes take de cursed lumps we no can break we took de cursed lumps we ride em in de cart to farm twenty milses i beat em with my hammer dey is very hard more dey break my heart dan i break their cursed heads one day i use strong words like white man and i hit one large lump too hard he break and out come de white clear stone iss him diamond long time we know him in our kraal because he hard long time before ever white man know him tousand years ago we find him and he make us lilly hole in big stone for make wheat dust him a diamond blank my eyes this was intended as a solemn form of asseveration adapted to the white mans habits yes reader he told the truth and strange to say the miners knew the largest stones were in these great lumps of carbonate but then the lumps were so cruelly hard they lost all patience with them and so finding it was no use to break some of them and not all they rejected them all with curses and thus this great stone was carted away as rubbish from the mine and found like a toad in a hole by squat well said christopher after all you are an honest fellow and i think i will buy it but first you must show me out of this wood i am not going to be eaten alive in it for want of the king of rifles squat assented eagerly and they started at once they passed the skeleton of the eland its very bones were polished and its head carried into the wood and looking back they saw vultures busy on the lion they soon cleared the wood squat handed staines the diamondwhen it touched his hand as his own a bolt of ice seemed to run down his back and hot water to follow itand the money horse rifle and skin were made over to squat shake hands over it squat said staines you are hard but you are honest iss master i a good much hard and honest said squat goodby old fellow goodby master and squat strutted away with the halter in his hand horse following him rifle under his arm and the lions skin over his shoulders and the tail trailing a figure sublime in his own eyes ridiculous in creations so vanity triumphed even in the wilds of africa staines hurried forward on foot loading his revolver as he went for the very vicinity of the wood alarmed him now that he had parted with his trusty rifle that night he lay down on the open veldt in his jackals skin with no weapon but his revolver and woke with a start a dozen times just before daybreak he scanned the stars carefully and noting exactly where the sun rose made a rough guess at his course and followed it till the sun was too hot then he crept under a ragged bush hung up his jackals skin and sweated there parched with thirst and gnawed with hunger when it was cooler he crept on and found water but no food he was in torture and began to be frightened for he was in a desert he found an ostrich egg and ate it ravenously next day hunger took a new form faintness he could not walk for it his jackals skin oppressed him he lay down exhausted a horror seized his dejected soul the diamond it would be his death no man must so long for any earthly thing as he had for this glittering traitor oh my good horse my trusty rifle he cried for what have i thrown you away for starvation misers have been found stretched over their gold and some day my skeleton will be found and nothing to tell the base death i died of and deserved nothing but the cursed diamond ay fiend glare in my eyes do he felt delirium creeping over him and at that a new terror froze him his reason that he had lost once was he to lose it again he prayed he wept he dozed and forgot all when he woke again a cool air was fanning his cheeks it revived him a little it became almost a breeze and this breeze as it happened carried on its wings the curse of africa there loomed in the northwest a cloud of singular density that seemed to expand in size as it drew nearer yet to be still more solid and darken the air it seemed a duststorm staines took out his handkerchief prepared to wrap his face in it not to be stifled but soon there was a whirring and a whizzing and hundreds of locusts flew over his head they were followed by thousands the swiftest of the mighty host they thickened and thickened till the air looked solid and even that glaring sun was blackened by the rushing mass birds of all sorts whirled above and swooped among them they peppered staines all over like shot they stuck in his beard and all over him they clogged the bushes carpeted the ground while the darkened air sang as with the whirl of machinery every bird in the air and beast of the field granivorous or carnivorous was gorged with them and to these animals was added man for staines being famished and remembering the vrow bulteel lighted a fire and roasted a handful or two on a flat stone they were delicious the fire once lighted they cooked themselves for they kept flying into it three hours without interruption did they darken nature and before the column ceased all the beasts of the field came after gorging them so recklessly that staines could have shot an antelope dead with his pistol within a yard of him but to tell the horrible truth the cooked locusts were so nice that he preferred to gorge on them along with the other animals he roasted another lot for future use and marched on with a good heart but now he got on some rough scrubby ground and damaged his shoes and tore his trousers this lasted a terrible distance but at the end of it came the usual arid ground and at last he came upon the track of wheels and hoofs he struck it at an acute angle and that showed him he had made a good line he limped along it a little way slowly being footsore by and by looking back he saw a lot of rough fellows swaggering along behind him then he was alarmed terribly alarmed for his diamond he tore a strip of his handkerchief and tied the stone cunningly under his armpit as he hobbled on the men came up with him hallo mate come from the diggings yes what luck very good haw haw what found a fiftycarat show it us we found five big stones my mate and me he is gone to cape town to sell them i had no luck when he had left me so i have cut it going to turn farmer can you tell me how far it is to dales kloof no they could not tell him that they swung on and to staines their backs were a cordial as we say in scotland however his travels were near an end next morning he saw dales kloof in the distance and as soon as the heat moderated he pushed on with one shoe and tattered trousers and half an hour before sunset he hobbled up to the place it was all bustle travellers at the door their wagons and carts under a long shed ucatella was the first to see him coming and came and fawned on him with delight her eyes glistened her teeth gleamed she patted both his cheeks and then his shoulders and even his knees and then flew indoors crying my doctor child is come home this amused three travellers and brought out dick with a hearty welcome but lordsake sir why have you come afoot and a rough road too look at your shoes hallo what is come of the horse i exchanged him for a diamond the deuce you did and the rifle exchanged that for the same diamond it ought to be a big un it is dick made a wry face well sir you know best you are welcome on horse or afoot you are just in time phoebe and me are just sitting down to dinner he took him into a little room they had built for their own privacy for they liked to be quiet now and then being country bred and phoebe was putting their dinner on the table when staines limped in she gave a joyful cry and turned red all over oh doctor then his traveltorn appearance struck her but dear heart what a figure wheres reginald oh hes not far off i know and she flung open the window and almost flew through it in a moment to look for her husband reginald said staines then turning to dick dale why he is hereisnt he no sir not without he is just come with you with meno you know we parted at the diggings come mr dale he may not be here now but he has been here he must have been here phoebe who had not lost a word turned round with all her high color gone

why whenwhere at the diggingsever so long ago blank him that is just like him the uneasy fool roared dick no mr dale you should not say that he left me with my consent to come to mrs falcon here and consult her about disposing of our diamonds diamondsdiamonds cried phoebe oh they make me tremble how could you let him go alone you didnt let him go on foot i hope oh no mrs falcon he had his horse and his rifle and money to spend on the road how long ago did he leave you sir ii am sorry to say it was five weeks ago five weeks and not come yet ah the wild beaststhe diggersthe murderers he is dead god forbid faltered staines but his own blood began to run cold he is dead he has died between this and the dreadful diamonds i shall never see my darling again he is dead he is dead she rushed out of the room and out of the house throwing her arms above her head in despair and uttering those words of agony again and again in every variety of anguish at such horrible moments women always swoonif we are to believe the dramatists i doubt if there is one grain of truth in this women seldom swoon at all unless their bodies are unhealthy or weakened by the reaction that follows so terrible a shock as this at all events phoebe at first was strong and wild as a lion and went to and fro outside the house unconscious of her bodys motion frenzied with agony and but one word on her lips he is deadhe is dead dick followed her crying like a child but master of himself he got his people about her and half carried her in again then shut the door in all their faces he got the poor creature to sit down and she began to rock and moan with her apron over her head and her brown hair loose about her why should he be dead said dick dont give a man up like that phoebe doctor tell us more about it oh man how could you let him out of your sight you knew how fond the poor creature was of him but that was it mr dale said staines i knew his wife must pine for him and we had found six large diamonds and a handful of small ones but the market was glutted and to get a better price he wanted to go straight to cape town but i said no go and show them to your wife and see whether she will go to cape town phoebe began to listen as was evident by her moaning more softly might he not have gone straight to cape town staines hazarded this timidly why should he do that sir dales kloof is on the road only on one road mr dale he was well armed with rifle and revolver and i cautioned him not to show a diamond on the road who would molest him diamonds dont show like gold who was to know he had three thousand pounds hidden under his armpits and in two barrels of his revolver three thousand pounds cried dale you trusted him with three thousand pounds certainly they were worth about three thousand pounds in cape town and half as much again in phoebe started up in a moment thank god she cried theres hope for me oh dick he is not dead he has only deserted me and with these strange and pitiable words she fell to sobbing as if her great heart would burst at last chapter xxiv there came a reaction and phoebe was prostrated with grief and alarm her brother never doubted now that reginald had run to cape town for a lark but phoebe though she thought so too could not be sure and so the double agony of bereavement and desertion tortured her by turns and almost together for the first time these many years she was so crushed she could not go about her business but lay on a little sofa in her own room and had the blinds down for her head ached so she could not bear the light she conceived a bitter resentment against staines and told dick never to let him into her sight if he did not want to be her death in vain dick made excuses for him she would hear none for once she was as unreasonable as any other living woman she could see nothing but that she had been happy after years of misery and should be happy now if this man had never entered her house ah collie she cried you were wiser than i was you as good as told me he would make me smart for lodging and curing him and i was so happy dale communicated this as delicately as he could to staines christopher was deeply grieved and wounded he thought it unjust but he knew it was natural he said humbly i feel guilty myself mr dale and yet unless i had possessed omniscience what could i do i thought of her in allpoor thing poor thing the tears were in his eyes and dick dale went away scratching his head and thinking it over the more he thought the less he was inclined to condemn him staines himself was much troubled in mind and lived on thorns he wanted to be off to england grudged every day every hour he spent in africa but mrs falcon was his benefactress he had been for months and months garnering up a heap of gratitude towards her he had not the heart to leave her bad friends and in misery he kept hoping falcon would return or write two days after his return he was seated disconsolate gluing garnets and carbuncles on to a broad tapering bit of lambskin when ucatella came to him and said my doctor child sick no not sick but miserable and he explained to her as well as he could what had passed but said he i would not mind the loss of the diamonds now if i was only sure he was alive i think most of poor poor mrs falcon while ucatella pondered this but with one eye of demure curiosity on the coronet he was making he told her it was for herhe had not forgot her at the mines these stones said he are not valued there but see how glorious they are in a few minutes he had finished the coronet and gave it her she uttered a chuckle of delight and with instinctive art bound it in a turn of her hand about her brow and then staines himself was struck dumb with amazement the carbuncles gathered from those mines look like rubies so full of fire are they and of enormous size the chaplet had twelve great carbuncles in the centre and went off by gradations into smaller garnets by the thousand they flashed their bloodred flames in the african sun and the head of ucatella grand before became the head of the sphinx encircled with a coronet of fire she bestowed a look of rapturous gratitude on staines and then glided away like the stately juno to admire herself in the nearest glass like any other coquette black brown yellow copper or white that very day towards sunset she burst upon staines quite suddenly with her coronet gleaming on her magnificent head and her eyes like coals of fire and under her magnificent arm hard as a rock a boy kicking and struggling in vain she was furiously excited and for the first time showed signs of the savage in the whites of her eyes which seemed to turn the glorious pupils into semicircles she clutched staines by the shoulder with her left hand and swept along with the pair like dark fate or as potent justice sweeps away a pair of culprits and carried them to the little window and cried openopen dick dale was at dinner phoebe lying down dick got up rather crossly and threw open the window what is up now said he crossly he was like two or three more englishmenhated to be bothered at dinnertime dar screamed ucatella setting down tim but holding him tight by the shoulder now you tell what you see that night you lilly kafir trash if you not tell i kill you dead and she showed the whites of her eyes like a wild beast tim thoroughly alarmed quivered out that he had seen lilly master ride up to the gate one bright night and look in and tim thought he was going in but he changed his mind and galloped away that way and the monkey pointed south and why couldnt you tell us this before questioned dick me mind de sheep said tim apologetically me not mind de lilly master jackals not eat him you no more sense dan a sheep yourself said ucatella loftily no no god bless you both cried poor phoebe now i know the worst and a great burst of tears relieved her suffering heart dick went out softly when he got outside the door he drew them all apart and said yuke you are a goodhearted girl ill never forget this while i live and tim theres a shilling for thee but dont you go and spend it in cape smoke that is poison to whites and destruction to blacks no master said tim i shall buy much bread and make my tomach tiff then with a glance of reproach at the domestic caterer ucatella i almost never have my tomach tiff dick left his sister alone an hour or two to have her cry out when he went back to her there was a change the brave woman no longer lay prostrate she went about her business only she was always either crying or drowning her tears he brought dr staines in phoebe instantly turned her back on him with a shudder there was no mistaking i had better go said staines mrs falcon will never forgive me she will have to quarrel with me else said dick steadily sit you down doctor honest folk like you and me and phoebe wasnt made to quarrel for want of looking a thing all round my sister she hasnt looked it all round and i have come pheeb tis no use your blinding yourself how was the poor doctor to know your husband is a blackguard he is not a blackguard how dare you say that to my face he is a blackguard and always was and now he is a thief to boot he has stolen those diamonds you know that very well gently mr dale you forget they are as much his as mine well and if half a sheep is mine and i take the whole and sell him and keep the money what is that but stealing why i wonder at you pheeb you was always honest yourself and yet you see the doctor robbed by your man and that does not trouble you what has he done to deserve it he has been a good friend to us he has put us on the road we did little more than keep the pot boiling before he camewell yes we stored grain but whose advice has turned that grain to gold i might say well whats his offence he trusted the diamonds to your man and sent him to you is he the first honest man that has trusted a rogue how was he to know likely he judged the husband by the wife answer me one thing pheeb if he makes away with fifteen hundred pounds that is his or partly yoursfor he has eaten your bread ever since i knew himand fifteen hundred more that is the doctors where shall we find fifteen hundred pounds all in a moment to pay the doctor back his own my honest friend said staines you are tormenting yourself with shadows i dont believe mr falcon will wrong me of a shilling and if he does i shall quietly repay myself out of the big diamond yes my dear friends i did not throw away your horse nor your rifle nor your money i gave them all and the lions skini gave them allfor this and he laid the big diamond on the table it was as big as a walnut and of the purest water dick dale glanced at it stupidly phoebe turned her back on it with a cry of horror and then came slowly round by degrees and her eyes were fascinated by the royal gem yes said staines sadly i had to strip myself of all to buy it and when i had got it how proud i was and how happy i thought we should all be over it for it is half yours half mine yes mr dale there lies six thousand pounds that belong to mrs falcon six thousand pounds cried dick im sure of it and so if your suspicions are correct and poor falcon should yield to a sudden temptation and spend all that money i shall just coolly deduct it from your share of this wonderful stone so make your mind easy but no if falcon is really so wicked as to desert his happy home and so mad as to spend thousands in a month or two let us go and save him that is my business said phoebe i am going in the mailcart tomorrow well you wont go alone said dick mrs falcon said staines imploringly let me go with you thank you sir my brother can take care of me me you had better not take me if i catch hold of him by ill break his neck or his back or his leg or something hell never run away from you again if i lay hands on him replied dick ill go alone you are both against me no mrs falcon i am not said staines my heart bleeds for you dont you demean yourself praying her said dick its a public conveyance you have no need to ask her leave that is true i cant hinder folk from going to cape town the same day said phoebe sullenly if i might presume to advise i would take little tommy what all that road do you want me to lose my child as well as my man o mrs falcon dont speak to her doctor to get your nose snapped off give her time shell come to her senses before she dies next day mrs falcon and staines started for cape town staines paid her every attention when opportunity offered but she was sullen and gloomy and held no converse with him he landed her at an inn and then told her he would go at once to the jewellers he asked her piteously would she lend him a pound or two to prosecute his researches she took out her purse without a word and lent him two pounds he began to scour the town the jewellers he visited could tell him nothing at last he came to a shop and there he found mrs falcon making her inquiries independently she said coldly you had better come with me and get your money and things she took him to the bankit happened to be the one she did business withand said this is dr christie come for his money and jewels there was some demur at this but the cashier recognized him and phoebe making herself responsible the money and jewels were handed over staines whispered phoebe are you sure the jewels are mine they were found on you sir staines took them looking confused he did not know what to think when they got into the street again he told her it was very kind of her to think of his interest at all no answer she was not going to make friends with him over such a trifle as that by degrees however christophers zeal on her behalf broke the ice and besides as the search proved unavailing she needed sympathy and he gave it her and did not abuse her husband as dick dale did one day in the street after a long thought she said to him didnt you say sir you gave him a letter for me i gave him two letters one of them was to you could you remember what you said in it perfectly i begged you if you should go to england to break the truth to my wife she is very excitable and sudden joy has killed ere now i gave you particular instructions and you were very wise but whatever could make you think i would go to england he told me you only wanted an excuse oh when he told me that i caught at it of course it was all the world to me to get my rosa told by such a kind good sensible friend as you and mrs falcon i had no scruple about troubling you because i knew the stones would sell for at least a thousand pounds more in england than here and that would pay your expenses i see sir i see twas very natural you love your wife better than my life and he told you i only wanted an excuse to go to england he did indeed it was not true it was anything but true i had suffered so in england i had been so happy here too happy to last ah well it is all over let us think of the matter in hand sure that was not the only letter you gave my husband didnt you write to her of course i did but that was enclosed to you and not to be given to her until you had broken the joyful news to her yes mrs falcon i wrote and told her everything my loss at sea how i was saved after by your kindness our journeys from cape town and then to the diggings my sudden good fortune my hopes my joyo my poor rosa and now i suppose she will never get it it is too cruel of him i shall go home by the next steamer i cant stay here any longer for you or anybody oh and i enclosed my ruby ring that she gave me for i thought she might not believe you without that let me think said phoebe turning ashy pale for mercys sake let me think he has read both those letters sir she will never see hers any more than i shall see mine she paused again thinking harder and harder we must take two places in the next mail steamer i must look after my husband and you after your wife chapter xxv mrs falcons bitter feeling against dr staines did not subside it merely went out of sight a little they were thrown together by potent circumstances and in a manner connected by mutual obligations so an open rupture seemed too unnatural still phoebe was a woman and blinded by her love for her husband could not forgive the innocent cause of their present unhappy separation though the fault lay entirely with falcon staines took her on board the steamer and paid her every attention she was also civil to him but it was a cold and constrained civility about a hundred miles from land the steamer stopped and the passengers soon learned there was something wrong with her machinery in fact after due consultation the captain decided to put back this irritated and distressed mrs falcon so that the captain desirous to oblige her hailed a fast schooner that tacked across her bows and gave mrs falcon the option of going back with him or going on in the schooner with whose skipper he was acquainted staines advised her on no account to trust to sails when she could have steam with only a delay of four or five days but she said anything sooner than go back i cant i cant on such an errand accordingly she was put on board the schooner and staines after some hesitation felt bound to accompany her it proved a sad error contrary winds assailed them the very next day and with such severity that they had repeatedly to lie to on one of these occasions with a ship reeling under them like a restive horse and the waves running mountains high poor phoebes terrors overmastered both her hostility and her reserve doctor said she i believe tis gods will we shall never see england i must try and die more like a christian than i have lived forgiving all who have wronged me and you that have been my good friend and my worst enemy but you did not mean it sir what has turned me against you soyour wife was my husbands sweetheart before he married me my wife your husbandsyou are dreaming nay sir once she came to my shop and i saw directly i was nothing to him and he owned it all to me he had courted her and she jilted him so he said why should he tell me a lie about that id lay my life tis true and now you have sent him to her your own self and at sight of her i shall be nothing again well when this ship goes down they can marry and i hope he will be happy happier than i can make him that tried my best god knows this conversation surprised staines not a little however he said with great warmth it was false his wife had danced and flirted with some young gentleman at one time when there was a brief misunderstanding between him and her but sweetheart she had never had except him he courted her fresh from school now my good soul said he make your mind easy the ship is a good one and well handled and in no danger whatever and my wife is in no danger from your husband since you and your brother tell me that he is a villain i am bound to believe you but my wife is an angel in our miserable hour of parting she vowed not to marry again should i be taken from her marry again what am i talking of why if he visits her at all it will be to let her know i am alive and give her my letter do you mean to tell me she will listen to vows of love from him when her whole heart is in rapture for me such nonsense this burst of his did not affront her and did not comfort her at last the wind abated and after a wearisome calm a light breeze came and the schooner crept homeward phoebe restrained herself for several days but at last she came back to the subject this time it was in an apologetic tone at starting i know you think me a foolish woman she said but my poor reginald could never resist a pretty face and she is so lovely and you should have seen how he turned when she came in to my place oh sir there has been more between them than you know of and when i think that he will have been in england so many months before we get there oh doctor sometimes i feel as i should go mad my head it is like a furnace and see my brow is all wrinkled again then staines tried to comfort her assured her she was tormenting herself idly her husband would perhaps have spent some of the diamond money on his amusement but what if he had he should deduct it out of the big diamond which was also their joint property and the loss would hardly be felt as to my wife madam i have but one anxiety lest he should go blurting it out that i am alive and almost kill her with joy he will not do that sir he is no fool i am glad of it for there is nothing else to fear man i tell you there is everything to fear you dont know him as i do nor his power over women mrs falcon are you bent on affronting me no sir heaven forbid then please to close this subject forever in three weeks we shall be in england ay but he has been there six months he bowed stiffly to her went to his cabin and avoided the poor foolish woman as much as he could without seeming too unkind chapter xxvi mrs staines made one or two movementsto stop lord tadcasterwith her hand that expressive feature with which at such times a sensitive woman can do all but speak when at last he paused for her reply she said me marry again oh for shame mrs stainesrosayou will marry again some day never me take another husband after such a man as i have lost i should be a monster oh lord tadcaster you have been so kind to me so sympathizing you made me believe you loved my christopher too and now you have spoiled all it is too cruel oh mrs staines do you think me capable of feigningdont you see my love for you has taken you by surprise but how could i visit youlook on youhear youmingle my regrets with yours yours were the deepest of course but mine were honest i believe it and she gave him her hand he held it and kissed it and cried over it as the young will and implored her on his knees not to condemn herself to lifelong widowhood and him to despair then she cried too but she was firm and by degrees she made him see that her heart was inaccessible then at last he submitted with tearful eyes but a valiant heart she offered friendship timidly but he was too much of a man to fall into that trap no he said i could not i could not love or nothing you are right said she pityingly forgive me in my selfishness and my usual folly i did not see this coming on or i would have spared you this mortification never mind that gulped the little earl i shall always be proud i knew you and proud i loved you and offered you my hand then the magnanimous little fellow blessed her and left her and discontinued his visits mr lusignan found her crying and got the truth out of her he was in despair he remonstrated kindly but firmly truth compels me to say that she politely ignored him he observed that phenomenon and said very well then i shall telegraph for uncle philip do said the rebel he is always welcome philip telegraphed came down that evening likewise his little black bag he found them in the drawingroom papa with the pall mall gazette rosa seated sewing at a lamp she made little christies clothes herselffancy that having ascertained that the little boy was well philip adroitly hiding that he had come down torn with anxiety on that head inquired with a show of contemptuous indifference whose cat was dead nobodys said lusignan crossly then he turned and pointed the gazette at his offspring do you see that young lady stitching there so demurely philip carefully wiped and then put on his spectacles i see her said he she does look a little too innocent none of them are really so innocent as all that has she been swearing at the nurse and boxing her ears worse than that she has been and refused the earl of tadcaster refused himwhat has that little monkey had the audacity the condescension you mean yes and she has refused him and twenty thousand a year what immorality worse what absurdity how is it to be accounted for is it the old story i could never love him no thats inadequate for they all love a title and twenty thousand a year rosa sewed on all this time in demure and absolute silence she ignores us said philip it is intolerable she does not appreciate our politeness in talking at her let us arraign her before our sacred tribunal and have her into court now mistress the senate of venice is assembled and you must be pleased to tell us why you refused a title and twenty thousand a year with a small but symmetrical earl tacked on rosa laid down her work and said quietly uncle almost the last words that passed between me and my christopher we promised each other solemnly never to marry again till death should us part you know how deep my sorrow has been that i can find so few wishes of my lost christopher to obey well today i have had an opportunity at last i have obeyed my own lost one it has cost me a tear or two but for all that it has given me one little gleam of happiness ah foolish woman that obeys too late and with this the tears began to run all this seemed a little too highflown to mr lusignan there said he see on what a straw her mind turns so but for that you would have done the right thing and married the earl i dare say i shouldat the timeto stop his crying and with this listless remark she quietly took up her sewing again the sagacious philip looked at her gravely he thought to himself how piteous it was to see so young and lovely a creature that had given up all hope of happiness for herself these being his real thoughts he expressed himself as follows we had better drop this subject sir this young lady will take us potent grave and reverend seignors out of our depth if we dont mind but the moment he got her alone he kissed her paternally and said rosa it is not lost on me your fidelity to the dead as years roll on and your deep wound first closes then skins then heals ah let me die first time and nature will absolve you from that vow but bless you for thinking this can never be rosa your folly of this day has made you my heir so never let money tempt you for you have enough and will have more than enough when i go he was as good as his word altered his will next day and made rosa his residuary legatee when he had done this foreseeing no fresh occasion for his services he prepared for a long visit to italy he was packing up his things to go there when he received a line from lady cicely treherne asking him to call on her professionally as the ladys servant brought it he sent back a line to say he no longer practised medicine but would call on her as a friend in an hours time he found her reclining the picture of lassitude how good of you to come she drawled whats the matter said he brusquely i wish to cawnsult you about myself i think if anybody can brighten me up it is you i feel such a languawsuch a want of spirit and i get palaa and that is not desiwable he examined her tongue and the white of her eye and told her in his blunt way she ate and drank too much excuse me sir said she stiffly i mean too often now lets see cup of tea in bed of a morning yaas dinner at two we call it luncheon are you a ventriloquist no then it is only your lips call it luncheon your poor stomach could it speak would call it dinner afternoon tea yaas at seventhirty another dinner tea after that your afflicted stomach gets no rest you eat pastry i confess

england as you are the best i should like to be much happier than i am good if we could manage it among us we will manage it among us for if the diet allowed should not make you boisterously gay i

mawwy a nice man a nice man no that means a fool marry scientificallya precaution eternally neglected marry a hibernian gentleman a being as mercurial as you are lymphatic mercuriallymphatic oh hard words break no bones maam no sir and it is very curious no i wont tell you yes i will hem ii think i have noticed one one what one iwishmandangling after me then your ladyship has only to tighten the cordand hes done for having administered this prescription our laughing philosopher went off to italy and there fell in with some countrymen to his mind so he accompanied them to egypt and palestine his absence and lord tadcasters made rosa stainess life extremely monotonous day followed day and week followed week each so unvarying that on a retrospect three months seemed like one day and i think at last youth and nature began to rebel and secretly to crave some little change or incident to ruffle the stagnant pool yet she would not go into society and would only receive two or three dull people at the villa so she made the very monotony which was beginning to tire her and nursed a sacred grief she had no need to nurse it was so truly genuine she was in this forlorn condition when one morning a carriage drove to the door and a card was brought up to hermr reginald falcon falcons history between this and our last advices is soon disposed of when after a little struggle with his better angel he rode past his wifes gate he intended at first only to go to cape town sell the diamonds have a lark and bring home the balance but as he rode south his views expanded he could have ten times the fun in london and cheaper since he could sell the diamonds for more money and also conceal the true price this was the bohemians whole mind in the business he had no designs whatever on mrs staines nor did he intend to steal the diamonds but to embezzle a portion of the purchasemoney and enjoy the pleasures and vices of the capital for a few months then back to his milch cow phoebe and lead a quiet life till the next uncontrollable fit should come upon him along with the means of satisfying it on the way he read stainess letter to mrs falcon very carefully he never broke the seal of the letter to mrs staines that was to be given her when he had broken the good news to her and this he determined to do with such skill as should make dr staines very unwilling to look suspiciously or illnaturedly into money accounts he reached london and being a thorough egotist attended first to his own interests he never went near mrs staines until he had visited every diamond merchant and dealer in the metropolis he showed the small stones to them all but he showed no more than one large stone to each at last he got an offer of twelve hundred pounds for the small stones and the same for the large yellow stone and nine hundred pounds for the second largest stone he took this nine hundred pounds and instantly wrote to phoebe telling her he had a sudden inspiration to bring the diamonds to england which he could not regret since he had never done a wiser thing he had sold a single stone for eight hundred pounds and had sent the doctors four hundred pounds to her account in cape town and as each sale was effected the half would be so remitted she would see by that he was wiser than in former days he should only stay so long as might be necessary to sell them all equally well his own share he would apply to paying off mortgages on the family estate of which he hoped some day to see her the mistress or he would send it direct to her whichever she might prefer now the main object of this artful letter was to keep phoebe quiet and not have her coming after him of which he felt she was very capable the money got safe to cape town but the letter to phoebe miscarried how this happened was never positively known but the servant of the lodginghouse was afterwards detected cutting stamps off a letter so perhaps she had played that game on this occasion by this means matters took a curious turn falcon intending to lull his wife into a false security lulled himself into that state instead when he had taken care of himself and got five hundred pounds to play the fool with then he condescended to remember his errand of mercy and he came down to gravesend to see mrs staines on the road he gave his mind seriously to the delicate and dangerous task it did not however disquiet him as it would you sir or you madam he had a great advantage over you he was a liara smooth ready accomplished liarand he knew it this was the outline he had traced in his mind he should appear very subdued and sad should wear an air of condolence but after a while should say and yet men have been lost like that and escaped a man was picked up on a raft in those very latitudes and brought into cape town a friend of mine saw him months after at the hospital his memory was shakencould not tell his name but in other respects he was all right again if mrs staines took fire at this he would say his friend knew all the particulars and he would ask him and so leave that to rankle till next visit and having planted his germ of hope he would grow it and water it by visits and correspondence till he could throw off the mask and say he was convinced staines was alive and from that by other degrees till he could say on his wifes authority that the man picked up at sea and cured at her house was the very physician who had saved her brothers life and so on to the overwhelming proof he carried in the ruby ring and the letter i am afraid the cunning and dexterity the subtlety and tact required interested him more in the commission than did the benevolence he called sent up his card and composed his countenance for his part like an actor at the wing not at home he stared with amazement the history of a not at home is not in general worth recording but this is an exception on receiving falcons card mrs staines gave a little start and colored faintly she instantly resolved not to see him what the man she had flirted with almost jilted and refused to marryhe dared to be alive when her christopher was dead and had come there to show her he was alive she said not at home with a tone of unusual sharpness and decision which left the servant in no doubt he must be equally decided at the hall door falcon received the sudden freezer with amazement nonsense said he not at home at this time of the morningto an old friend not at home said the man doggedly oh very well said falcon with a bitter sneer and returned to london he felt sure she was at home and being a tremendous egotist he said oh all right if she would rather not know her husband is alive it is all one to me and he actually took no more notice of her for a full week and never thought of her except to chuckle over the penalty she was paying for daring to affront his vanity however sunday came he saw a dull day before him and so he relented and thought he would give her another trial he went down to gravesend by boat and strolled towards the villa when he was about a hundred yards from the villa a lady all in black came out with a nurse and child falcon knew her figure all that way off and it gave him a curious thrill that surprised him he followed her and was not very far behind her when she reached the church she turned at the porch kissed the child earnestly and gave the nurse some directions then entered the church come said falcon ill have a look at her any way he went into the church and walked up a side aisle to a pillar from which he thought he might be able to see the whole congregation and sure enough there she sat a few yards from him she was lovelier than ever mind had grown on her face with trouble an angelic expression illuminated her beauty he gazed on her fascinated he drank and drank her beauty two mortal hours and when the church broke up and she went home he was half afraid to follow her for he felt how hard it would be to say anything to her but that the old love had returned on him with double force however having watched her home he walked slowly to and fro composing himself for the interview he now determined to make the process of informing her a very long one he would spin it out and so secure many a sweet interview with her and who knows he might fascinate her as she had him and ripen gratitude into love as he understood that word he called he sent in his card the man went in and came back with a sonorous not at home not at home nonsense why she is just come in from church not at home said the man evidently strong in his instructions falcon turned white with rage at this second affront all the worse for her said he and turned on his heel he went home raging with disappointment and wounded vanity andsince such love as his is seldom very far from hatehe swore she should never know from him that her husband was alive he even moralized this comes of being so unselfish said he ill give that game up forever by and by a mere negative revenge was not enough for him and he set his wits to work to make her smart he wrote to her from his lodgings dear madamwhat a pity you are never at home to me i had something to say about your husband that i thought might interest you yours truly r falcon imagine the effect of this abominable note it was like a rock flung into a placid pool it set rosa trembling all over what could he mean she ran with it to her father and asked him what mr falcon could mean i have no idea said he you had better ask him not me i am afraid it is only to get to see me you know he admired me once ah how suspicious i am getting rosa wrote to falcon dear sirsince my bereavement i see scarcely anybody my servant did not know you so i hope you will excuse me if it is too much trouble to call again would you kindly explain your note to me yours respectfully rosa staines falcon chuckled bitterly over this no my lady said he ill serve you out you shall run after me like a little dog i have got the bone that will draw you he wrote back coldly to say that the matter he had wished to communicate was too delicate and important to put on paper that he would try and get down to gravesend again some day or other but was much occupied and had already put himself to inconvenience he added in a postscript that he was always at home from four to five next day he got hold of the servant and gave her minute instructions and a guinea then the wretch got some tools and bored a hole in the partition wall of his sittingroom the paper had large flowers he was artist enough to conceal the trick with watercolors in his bedroom the hole came behind the curtains that very afternoon as he had foreseen mrs staines called on him the maid duly instructed said mr falcon was out but would soon return and could she wait his return the maid being so very civil mrs staines said she would wait a little while and was immediately ushered into falcons sittingroom there she sat down but was evidently ill at ease restless flushed she could not sit quiet and at last began to walk up and down the room almost wildly her beautiful eyes glittered and the whole woman seemed on fire the caitiff who was watching her saw and gloated on all this and enjoyed to the full her beauty and agitation and his revenge for her not at homes but after a long time there was a reaction she sat down and uttered some plaintive sounds inarticulate or nearly and at last she began to cry then it cost falcon an effort not to come in and comfort her but he controlled himself and kept quiet she rang the bell she asked for writing paper and she wrote her unseen tormentor a humble note begging him for old acquaintance to call on her and tell her what his mysterious words meant that had filled her with agitation this done she went away with a deep sigh and falcon emerged and pounced upon her letter he kissed it he read it a dozen times he sat down where she had sat and his base passion overpowered him her beauty her agitation her fear her tears all combined to madden him and do the devils work in his false selfish heart so open to violent passions so dead to conscience for once in his life he was violently agitated and torn by conflicting feelings he walked about the room more wildly than his victim had and if it be true that in certain great temptations good and bad angels fight for a man here you might have seen as fierce a battle of that kind as ever was at last he rushed out into the air and did not return till ten oclock at night he came back pale and haggard and with a look of crime upon his face true bohemian as he was he sent for a pint of brandy so then the die was cast and something was to be done that called for brandy he bolted himself in and drank a wineglass of it neat then another then another now his pale cheek is flushed and his eye glitters drink forever great ruin of english souls as well as bodies he put the poker in the fire and heated it red hot he brought stainess letter and softened the sealingwax with the hot poker then with his penknife made a neat incision in the wax and opened the letter he took out the ring and put it carefully away then he lighted a cigar and read the letter and studied it many a man capable of murder in heat of passion could not have resisted the pathos of this letter many a newgate thief after reading it would have felt such pity for the loving husband who had suffered to the verge of death and then to the brink of madness and for the poor bereaved wife that he would have taken the letter down to gravesend that very night though he picked two fresh pockets to defray the expenses of the road but this was an egotist good nature had curbed his egotism a little while but now vanity and passion had swept away all unselfish feelings and the pure egotist alone remained now the pure egotist has been defined as a man who will burn down his neighbors house to cook himself an egg murder is but egotism carried out to its natural climax what is murder to a pure egotist especially a brandied one i knew an egotist who met a female acquaintance in newhaven village she had a onepound note and offered to treat him she changed this note to treat him fish she gave him and much whiskey cost her four shillings he ate and drank with her at her expense and his aorta or principal bloodvessel being warmed with her whiskey he murdered her for the change the odd sixteen shillings i had the pleasure of seeing that egotist hung with these eyes it was a slice of luck that i grieve to say has not occurred again to me so much for a whiskied egotist his less truculent but equally remorseless brother in villany the brandied egotist falcon could read that poor husbands letter without blenching the love and the anticipations of rapture these made him writhe a little with jealousy but they roused not a grain of pity he was a true egotist blind remorseless in this his true character he studied the letter profoundly and mastered all the facts and digested them well all manner of diabolical artifices presented themselves to his brain barren of true intellect yet fertile in fraud in that and all low cunning and subtlety far more than a match for solomon or bacon his sinister studies were pursued far into the night then he went to bed and his unbounded egotism gave him the sleep a grander criminal would have courted in vain on the verge of a monstrous and deliberate crime next day he went to a fashionable tailor and ordered a complete suit of black this was made in fortyeight hours the interval was spent mainly in concocting lies to be incorporated with the number of minute facts he had gained from stainess letter and in making close imitations of his handwriting thus armed and crammed with more lies than the menteur of corneille but not such innocent ones he went down to gravesend all in deep mourning with crape round his hat he presented himself at the villa the servant was all obsequiousness yes mrs staines received few visitors but she was at home to him he even began to falter excuses nonsense said falcon and slipped a sovereign into his hand you are a good servant and obey orders the servants respect doubled and he ushered the visitor into the drawingroom as one whose name was a passport mr reginald falcon madam mrs staines was alone she rose to meet him her color came and went her full eye fell on him and took in all at a glancethat he was all in black and that he had a beard and looked pale and ill at ease little dreaming that this was the anxiety of a felon about to take the actual plunge into a novel crime she was rather prepossessed by it the beard gave him dignity and hid his mean cruel mouth his black suit seemed to say he too had lost some one dear to him and that was a ground of sympathy she received him kindly and thanked him for taking the trouble to come again she begged him to be seated and then womanlike she waited for him to explain but he was in no hurry and waited for her he knew she would speak if he was silent she could not keep him waiting long mr falcon said she hesitating a little you have something to say to me about him i have lost yes said he softly i have something i could say and i think i ought to say it but i am afraid because i dont know what will be the result i fear to make you more unhappy me more unhappy me whose dear husband lies at the bottom of the ocean other poor wounded creatures have the wretched comfort of knowing where he liesof carrying flowers to his tomb but ioh mr falcon i am bereaved of all even his poor remains lostlostshe could say no more then that craven heart began to quake at what he was doing quaked yet persevered but his own voice quivered and his cheek grew ashy pale no wonder if ever god condescended to pour lightning on a skunk surely now was the time shaking and sweating with terror at his own act he stammered out would it be the least comfort to you to know that you are not denied that poor consolation suppose he died not so miserably as you think suppose he was picked up at sea in a dying state ah suppose he lingered nursed by kind and sympathizing hands that almost saved him suppose he was laid in hallowed ground and a great many tears shed over his grave ah that would indeed be a comfort and it was to say this you came i thank you i bless you but my good kind friend you are deceived you dont know my husband you never saw him he perished at sea will it be kind or unkind to tell you why i think he died as i tell you and not at sea kind but impossible you deceive yourself ah i see you found some poor sufferer and were good to him but it was not my poor christie oh if it were i should worship you but i thank you as it is it was very kind to want to give me this little little crumb of comfort for i know i did not behave well to you sir but you are generous and have forgiven a poor heartbroken creature that never was very wise he gave her time to cry and then said to her i only wanted to be sure it would be any comfort to you mrs staines it is true i did not even know his name nor yours when i met in this very room the great disappointment that has saddened my own life i left england directly i collected funds went to natal and turned landowner and farmer i have made a large fortune but i need not tell you i am not happy well i had a yacht and sailing from cape town to algoa bay i picked up a raft with a dying man on it he was perishing from exhaustion and exposure i got a little brandy between his lips and kept him alive i landed with him at once and we nursed him on shore we had to be very cautious he improved we got him to take eggflip he smiled on us at first and then he thanked us i nursed him day and night for ten days he got much stronger he spoke to me thanked me again and again and told me his name was christopher staines he told me that he should never get well i implored him to have courage he said he did not want for courage but nature had been tried too hard we got so fond of each other ohand the caitiff pretended to break down and his feigned grief mingled with rosas despairing sobs he made an apparent effort and said he spoke to me of his wife his darling rosa the name made me start but i could not know it was you at last he was strong enough to write a few lines and he made me promise to take them to his wife ah said rosa show them me i will this moment and her hands began to work convulsively i cannot said falcon i have not brought them with me rosa cast a keen eye of suspicion and terror on him his not bringing the letter seemed monstrous and so indeed it was the fact is the letter was not written falcon affected not to notice her keen look he flowed on the address he put on that letter astonished me kent villa of course i knew kent villa and he called you rosa how could you come to me without that letter cried rosa wringing her hands how am i to know it is all so strange so incredible dont you believe me said falcon sadly why should i deceive you the first time i came down to tell you all this i did not know who mrs staines was i suspected but no more the second time i saw you in the church and then i knew and followed you to try and tell you all this and you were not at home to me forgive me said rosa carelessly then earnestly the letter when can i see it i will send or bring it bring it i am in agony till i see it oh my darling my darling it cant be true it was not my christie he lies in the depths of the ocean lord tadcaster was in the ship and he says so everybody says so and i say he sleeps in hallowed ground and these hands laid him there rosa lifted her hands to heaven and cried piteously i dont know what to think you would not willingly deceive me but how can this be oh uncle philip why are you away from me sir you say he gave you a letter yes oh why why did you not bring it because he told me the contents and i thought he prized my poor efforts too highly it did not occur to me you would doubt my word oh no no more i do but i fear it was not my christie ill go for the letter at once mrs staines oh thank you bless you yes this minute the artful rogue did not go never intended he rose to go but had a sudden inspiration very sudden of course had he nothing about him you could recognize him by yes he had a ring i gave him falcon took a blackedged envelope out of his pocket a ruby ring said she beginning to tremble at his quiet action is that it and he handed her a ruby ring chapter xxvii mrs staines uttered a sharp cry and seized the ring her eyes dilated over it and she began to tremble in every limb and at last she sank slowly back and her head fell on one side like a broken lily the sudden sight of the ring overpowered her almost to fainting falcon rose to call for assistance but she made him a feeble motion not to do so she got the better of her faintness and then she fell to kissing the ring in an agony of love and wept over it and still held it and gazed at it through her blinding tears falcon eyed her uneasily but he soon found he had nothing to fear for a long time she seemed scarcely aware of his presence and when she noticed him it was to thank him almost passionately it was my christie you were so good to may heaven bless you for it and you will bring me his letter will you not of course i will oh do not go yet it is all so strange so sad i seem to have lost my poor christie again since he did not die at sea but no i am ungrateful to god and ungrateful to the kind friend that nursed him to the last ah i envy you that tell me all never mind my crying i have seen the time i could not cry it was worse then than now i shall always cry when i speak of him ay to my dying day tell me tell me all her passion frightened the egotist but did not turn him he had gone too far he told her that after raising all their hopes dr staines had suddenly changed for the worse and sunk rapidly that his last words had been about her and he had said my poor rosa who will protect her that to comfort him he had said he would protect her then the dying man had managed to write a line or two and to address it almost his last words had been be a father to my child that is strange you have no child then it must have been you he meant he spoke of you as a child more than once mr falcon i have a child but born since i lost my poor childs father then i think he knew it they say that dying men can see all over the world and i remember when he said it his eyes seemed fixed very strangely as if on something distant oh how wonderful all this is may i see his child to whom i promised the artist in lies left his sentence half completed rosa rang and sent for her little boy mr falcon admired his beauty and said quietly i shall keep my vow he then left her with a promise to come back early next morning with the letter she let him go only on those conditions as soon as her father came in she ran to him with this strange story i dont believe it said he it is impossible she showed him the proof the ruby ring then he became very uneasy and begged her not to tell a soul he did not tell her the reason but he feared the insurance office would hear of it and require proofs of christophers decease whereas they had accepted it without a murmur on the evidence of captain hamilton and the amphitrites logbook as for falcon he went carefully through stainess two letters and wherever he found a word that suited his purpose he traced it by the usual process and so in the course of a few hours he concocted a short letter all the words in which except three were facsimiles only here and there a little shaky the three odd words he had to imitate by observation of the letters the signature he got to perfection by tracing he inserted this letter in the original envelope and sealed it very carefully so as to hide that the seal had been tampered with thus armed he went down to gravesend there he hired a horse and rode to kent villa why he hired a horse he knew how hard it is to forge handwriting and he chose to have the means of escape at hand he came into the drawingroom ghastly pale and almost immediately gave her the letter then turned his back feigning delicacy in reality he was quaking with fear lest she should suspect the handwriting but the envelope was addressed by staines and paved the way for the letter she was unsuspicious and good and her heart cried out for her husbands last written words at such a moment what chance had judgment and suspicion in an innocent and loving soul her eloquent sighs and sobs soon told the caitiff he had nothing to fear the letter ran thus my own rosaall that a brother could do for a beloved brother falcon has done he nursed me night and day but it is vain i shall never see you again in this world i send you a protector and a father to your child value him he has promised to be your stay on earth and my spirit shall watch over youto my last breath your loving husband christopher staines falcon rose and began to steal on tiptoe out of the room rosa stopped him you need not go said she you are our friend by and by i hope i shall find words to thank you pray let me retire a moment said the hypocrite a husbands last words too sacreda stranger and he went out into the garden there he found the nursemaid emily and the little boy he stopped the child and made love to the nursemaid showed her his diamondshe carried them all about himtold her he had thirty thousand acres in cape colony and diamonds on them and was going to buy thirty thousand more of the government here take one said he oh you neednt be shy they are common enough on my estates ill tell you what though you could not buy that for less than thirty pounds at any shop in london could she my little duck never mind it is no brighter than her eyes now do you know what she will do with that master christie she will give it to some duffer to put in a pin she wont do nothing of the kind said emily flushing all over she is not such a fool she then volunteered to tell him she had no sweetheart and did not trouble her head about young men at all he interpreted this to mean she was looking out for one so do i no sweetheart said he and the prettiest girl i have seen since i landed then i put in for the situation here seeing the footman coming he bestowed a most paternal kiss on little christie and saying not a word to john or no more diamonds from me he moved carefully away leaving the girl all in a flutter with extravagant hopes the next moment this wolf in the sheepfold entered the drawingroom mrs staines was not there he waited and waited and began to get rather uneasy as men will who walk among pitfalls presently the footman came to say that mrs staines was with her father in his study but she would come to him in five minutes this increased his anxiety what she was taking advice of an older head he began to be very seriously alarmed and indeed had pretty well made up his mind to go down and gallop off when the door opened and rosa came hastily in her eyes were very red with weeping she came to him with both hands extended to him he gave her his timidly she pressed them with such earnestness and power as he could not have suspected and thanked him and blessed him with such a torrent of eloquence that he hung his head with shame and being unable to face it out villain as he was yet still artful to the core he pretended to burst out crying and ran out of the room and rode away he waited two days and then called again rosa reproached him sweetly for going before she had half thanked him all the better said he i have been thanked a great deal too much already who would not do his best for a dying countryman and fight night and day to save him for his wife and child at home if i had succeeded then i would be greedy of praise but now it makes me blush it makes me very sad you did your best said rosa tearfully ah that i did indeed i was ill for weeks after myself through the strain upon my mind and the disappointment and going so many nights without sleep but dont let us talk of that do you know what my darling says to me in my letter no would you like to see it indeed i should but i have no right every right it is the only mark of esteem worth anything i can show you she handed him the letter and buried her own face in her hands he read it and acted the deepest emotion he handed it back without a word chapter xxviii from this time falcon was always welcome at kent villa he fascinated everybody in the house he renewed his acquaintance with mr lusignan and got asked to stay a week in the house he showed rosa and her father the diamonds and the truth must be owned they made rosas eyes sparkle for the first time this eighteen months he insinuated rather than declared his enormous wealth in reply to the old mans eager questions as the large diamonds lay glittering on the table and pointed every word he said that a few of his hottentots had found these for him he had made them dig on a diamondiferous part of his estate just by way of testing the matter and this was the result this and a much larger stone for which he had received eight thousand pounds from posno if i was a young man said lusignan i would go out directly and dig on your estate i would not let you do anything so paltry said le menteur why my dear sir there are no fortunes to be made by grubbing for diamonds the fortunes are made out of the diamonds but not in that way now i have thirty thousand acres and am just concluding a bargain for thirty thousand more on which i happen to know there are diamonds in a sly corner well of my thirty thousand tried acres a hundred only are diamondiferous but i have four thousand thirtyfoot claims leased at ten shillings per month count that up why it is twentyfour thousand pounds a year excuse me you must deduct a thousand a year for the expenses of collection but this is only one phase of the business i have a large inn upon each of the three great routes from the diamonds to the coast and these inns are supplied with the produce of my own farms mark the effect of the diamonds on property my sixty thousand acres which are not diamondiferous will very soon be worth as much as sixty thousand english acres say two pounds the acre per annum that is under the mark because in africa the land is not burdened with poorrates tithes and all the other iniquities that crush the english landowner as i know to my cost but that is not all sir would you believe it even after the diamonds were declared the people out there had so little foresight that they allowed me to buy land all round port elizabeth natal and cape town the three ports through which the world get at the diamonds and the diamonds get at the world i have got a girdle of land round those three outlets bought by the acre in two years i shall sell it by the yard believe me sir english fortunes even the largest are mere childs play compared with the colossal wealth a man can accumulate if he looks beyond these great discoveries to their consequences and lets others grub for him but what is the use of it all to me said this bohemian with a sigh i have no taste for luxuries no love of display i have not even charity to dispense on a large scale for there are no deserving poor out there and the poverty that springs from vice that i never will encourage john heard nearly all this and took it into the kitchen and henceforth adoration was the only word for this prince of men this rare combination of the adonis and the millionnaire he seldom held such discourses before rosa but talked her father into an impression of his boundless wealth and half reconciled him to rosas refusal of lord tadcaster since here was an old suitor who doubtless with a little encouragement would soon come on again under this impression mr lusignan gave falcon more than a little encouragement and as rosa did not resist he became a constant visitor at the villa and was always there from saturday to monday he exerted all his art of pleasing and he succeeded he was welcome to rosa and she made no secret of it emily threw herself in his way and had many a sly talk with him while he was pretending to be engaged with young christie he flattered her and made her sweet on him but was too much in love with rosa after his fashion to flirt seriously with her he thought he might want her services so he worked upon her after this fashion asked her if she would like to keep an inn wouldnt i just said she frankly then he told her that if all went to his wish in england she should be landlady of one of his inns in the cape colony and you will get a good husband out there directly said he beauty is a very uncommon thing in those parts but i shall ask you to marry somebody who can help you in the businessor not to marry at all i wish i had the inn said emily husbands are soon got when a girl hasnt her face only to look to well i promise you the inn said he and a good outfit of clothes and money in both pockets if you will do me a good turn here in england that i would sir but laws what can a poor girl like me do for a rich gentleman like you can you keep a secret emily nobody better you try me sir he looked at her well saw she was one of those who could keep a secret if she chose and he resolved to risk it emily my girl said he sadly i am an unhappy man you sir why you didnt ought to be i am then i am in love and cannot win her then he told the girl a pretty tender tale that he had loved mrs staines when she was miss lusignan had thought himself beloved in turn but was rejected and now though she was a widow he had not the courage to court her her heart was in the grave he spoke in such a broken voice that the girls goodnature fought against her little pique at finding how little he was smitten with her and falcon soon found means to array her cupidity on the side of her goodnature he gave her a fivepound note to buy gloves and promised her a fortune and she undertook to be secret as the grave and say certain things adroitly to mrs staines accordingly this young woman omitted no opportunity of dropping a word in favor of falcon for one thing she said to mrs staines mr falcon must be very fond of children maam why he worships master christie indeed i have not observed that why no maam he is rather shy over it but when he sees us alone he is sure to come to us and say let me look at my child nurse and he do seem fit to eat him onst he says to me this boy is my heir nurse what did he mean by that maam i dont know is he any kin to you maam none whatever you must have misunderstood him you should not repeat all that people say no maam only i did think it so odd poor gentleman i dont think he is happy for all his money he is too good to be unhappy all his life so i think maam these conversations were always short for rosa though she was too kind and gentle to snub the girl was also too delicate to give the least encouragement to her gossip but rosas was a mind that could be worked upon and these short but repeated eulogies were not altogether without effect at last the insidious falcon by not making his approaches in a way to alarm her acquired her friendship as well as her gratitude and in short she got used to him and liked him not being bound by any limit of fact whatever he entertained her and took her out of herself a little by extemporaneous pictures he told her all his thrilling adventures by flood and field not one of which had ever occurred yet he made them all sound like truth he invented strange characters and set them talking he went after great whales and harpooned one which slapped his boat into fragments with one stroke of its tail then died and he hung on by the harpoon protruding from the carcass till a ship came and picked him up he shot a lion that was carrying off his favorite hottentot he encountered another wounded him with both barrels was seized and dragged along the ground and gave himself up for lost but kept firing his revolver down the monsters throat till at last he sickened him and so escaped out of deaths maw he did not say how he had fired in the air and ridden fourteen miles on end at the bare sight of a lions cub but to compensate that one reserve plunged into a raging torrent and saved a drowning woman by her long hair which he caught in his teeth he rode a race on an ostrich against a friend on a zebra which went faster but threw his rider and screamed with rage at not being able to eat him he falcon having declined to run unless his friends zebra was muzzled he fed the hungry clothed the naked and shot a wild elephant in the eye and all this he enlivened with pictorial descriptions of no mean beauty and as like south africa as if it had been feu george robins advertising that continent for sale in short never was there a more voluble and interesting liar by word of mouth and never was there a more agreeable creature interposed between a bereaved widow and her daily grief and regrets he diverted her mind from herself and did her good at last such was the charm of infinite lying she missed him on the days he did not come and was brighter when he did come and lie things went smoothly and so pleasantly that he would gladly have prolonged this form of courtship for a month or two longer sooner than risk a premature declaration but more than one cause drove him to a bolder course his passion which increased in violence by contact with its beautiful object and also a great uneasiness he felt at not hearing from phoebe this silence was ominous he and she knew each other and what the other was capable of he knew she was the woman to cross the seas after him if staines left the diggings and any explanation took place that might point to his whereabouts these double causes precipitated matters and at last he began to throw more devotion into his manner and having so prepared her for a few days he took his opportunity and said one day we are both unhappy give me the right to console you she colored high and said you have consoled me more than all the world but there is a limit always will be one less adroit would have brought her to the point but this artist only sighed and let the arrow rankle by this means he outfenced her for now she had listened to a declaration and not stopped it short he played melancholy for a day or two and then he tried her another way he said i promised your dying husband to be your protector and a father to his child i see but one way to keep my word and that gives me courage to speakwithout that i never could rosa i loved you years ago i am unmarried for your sake let me be your husband and a father to your child rosa shook her head i could not marry again i esteem you i am very grateful to you and i know i behaved ill to you before if i could marry again it would be you but i cannot oh never never then we both are to be unhappy all our days i shall as i ought to be you will not i hope i shall miss you sadly but for all that i advise you to leave me you will carry my everlasting gratitude go where you will that and my esteem are all i have to give i will go said he and i hope he who is gone will forgive my want of courage he who is gone took my promise never to marry again dying men see clearer i am sure he wishedno matter it is too delicate he kissed her hand and went out a picture of dejection mrs staines shed a tear for him nothing was heard of him for several days and rosa pitied him more and more and felt a certain discontent with herself and doubt whether she had done right matters were in this state when one morning emily came screaming in from the garden the childmaster christiewhere is hewhere is he the house was alarmed the garden searched the adjoining paddock the child was gone emily was examined and owned with many sobs and hysterical cries that she had put him down in the summerhouse for a minute while she went to ask the gardener for some balm balm tea being a favorite drink of hers but there was nobody near that i saw she sobbed further inquiry proved however that a tall gypsy woman had been seen prowling about that morning and suspicion instantly fastened on her servants were sent out right and left but nothing discovered and the agonized mother terrified out of her wits had falcon telegraphed to immediately he came galloping down that very evening and heard the story he galloped into gravesend and after seeing the police sent word out he should advertise he placarded gravesend with bills offering a reward of a thousand pounds the child to be brought to him and no questions asked meantime the police and many of the neighboring gentry came about the miserable mother with their vague ideas down comes falcon again next day tells what he has done and treats them all with contempt dont you be afraid mrs staines said he you will get him back i have taken the sure way this sort of rogues dare not go near the police and the police cant find them you have no enemies it is only some woman that has fancied a beautiful child well she can have them by the score for a thousand pounds he was the only one with a real idea the woman saw it and clung to him he left late at night next morning out came the advertisements and he sent her a handful by special messenger his zeal and activity kept her bereaved heart from utter despair at eleven that night came a telegraph i have got him coming down by special train then what a burst of joy and gratitude the very walls of the house seemed to ring with it as a harp rings with music a special train too he would not let the mother yearn all night at one in the morning he drove up with the child and a hired nurse imagine the scene the mothers screams of joy her furious kisses her cooing her tears and all the miracles of nature at such a time the servants all mingled with their employers in the general rapture and emily who was pale as death cried and sobbed and said oh maam ill never let him out of my sight again no not for one minute falcon made her a signal and went out she met him in the garden she was much agitated and cried oh you did well to bring him today i could not have kept it another hour im a wretch you are a good kind girl and heres the fifty pounds i promised you well and i have earned it of course you have meet me in the garden tomorrow morning and ill show you you have done a kind thing to your mistress as well as me and as for the fifty pounds that is nothing do you hear it is nothing at all compared with what i will do for you if you will be true to me and hold your tongue oh as for that my tongue shant betray you nor shame me you are a gentleman and i do think you love her or i would not help you so she salved her nursemaids consciencewith the help of the fifty pounds the mother was left to her rapture that night in the morning falcon told his tale at two pm a man had called on him and had produced one of his advertisements and had asked him if that was all squareno bobbies on the lurk all square my fine fellow well said he i suppose you are a gentleman i am of that opinion too well sir says he i know a party as has found a young gent as comes werry nigh your advertisement it will be a very lucky

he i am replied i will you come and see if it is all right said he in a minute said i stepped into my bedroom and loaded my sixshooter what is that said lusignan a revolver with six barrels by the by the very same i killed the lion with ugh i never think of that scene without feeling a little quiver and my nerves are pretty good too well he took me into an awful part of the town down a filthy close into some boozing keni beg pardon some thieves publichouse oh my dear friend said rosa were you not frightened shall i tell you the truth or play the hero i think ill tell you the truth i felt a little frightened lest they should get my money and my life without my getting my godson that is what i call him now well two ugly dogs came in and said let us see the flimsies before you see the kid that is rather sharp practice i think said i however heres the swag and heres the watchdog so i put down the notes and my hand over them with my revolver cocked and ready to fire yes yes said rosa pantingly ah you were a match for them well mrs staines if i was writing you a novel i suppose i should tell you the rogues recoiled but the truth is they only laughed and were quite pleased swells in earnest said one jem show the kid jem whistled and in came a great tall black gypsy woman with the darling my heart was in my mouth but i would not let them see it i said it is all right take half the notes here and half at the door they agreed and then i did it quick walked to the door took the child gave them the odd notes and made off as fast as i could hired a nurse at the hospitaland the rest you know papa said rosa with enthusiasm there is but one man in england who would have got me back my child and this is he when they were alone falcon told her she had said words that gladdened his very heart you admit i can carry out one half of his wishes said he mrs staines said yes then colored high then to turn it off said but i cannot allow you to lose that large sum of money you must let me repay you large sum of money said he it is no more to me than sixpence to most people i dont know what to do with my money and i never shall know unless you will make a sacrifice of your own feelings to the wishes of the dead o mrs stainesrosa do pray consider that a man of that wisdom sees the future and gives wise advice sure am i that if you could overcome your natural repugnance to a second marriage it would be the best thing for your little boyi love him already as if he were my ownand in time would bring you peace and comfort and some day years hence even happiness you are my only love yet i should never have come to you again if he had not sent me do consider how strange it all is and what it points to and dont let me have the misery of losing you again when you can do no better now alas than reward my fidelity she was much moved at this artful appeal and said if i was sure i was obeying his will but how can i feel that when we both promised never to wed again a mans dying words are more sacred than any other you have his letter yes but he does not say marry again that is what he meant though how can you say that how can you know because i put the words he said to me together with that short line to you mind i dont say that he did not exaggerate my poor merits on the contrary i think he did but i declare to you that he did hope i should take care of you and your child right or wrong it was his wish so pray do not deceive yourself on that point this made more impression on her than anything else he could say and she said i promise you one thing i will never marry any man but you instead of pressing her further as an inferior artist would he broke into raptures kissed her hand tenderly and was in such high spirits and so voluble all day that she smiled sweetly on him and thought to herself poor soul how happy i could make him with a word as he was always watching her facea practice he carried further than any person livinghe divined that sentiment and wrought upon it so that at last he tormented her into saying she would marry him some day when he had brought her to that he raged inwardly to think he had not two years to work in for it was evident she would marry him in time but no it had taken him more than four months close siege to bring her to that no word from phoebe an ominous dread hung over his own soul his wife would be upon him or worse still her brother dick who he knew would beat him to a mummy on the spot or worst of all the husband of rosa staines who would kill him or fling him into a prison he must make a push in this emergency he used his ally mr lusignan he told him mrs staines had promised to marry him but at some distant date this would not do he must look after his enormous interests in the colony and he was so much in love he could not leave her the old gentleman was desperately fond of falcon and bent on the match and he actually consented to give his daughter what falcon called a little push the little push was a very great one i think it consisted in directing the clergyman to call in church the banns of marriage between reginald falcon and rosa staines they were both in church together when this was done rosa all but screamed and then turned red as fire and white as a ghost by turns she never stood up again all the service and in going home refused falcons arm and walked swiftly home by herself not that she had the slightest intention of passing this monstrous thing by in silence on the contrary her wrath was boiling over and so hot that she knew she should make a scene in the street if she said a word there once inside the house she turned on falcon with a white cheek and a flashing eye and said follow me sir if you please she led the way to her fathers study papa said she i throw myself on your protection mr falcon has affronted me oh rosa cried falcon affecting utter dismay publiclypublicly he has had the banns of marriage cried in the church without my permission dont raise your voice so loud child all the house will hear you i choose all the house to hear me i will not endure it i will never marry you nownever rosa my child said lusignan you need not scold poor falcon for i am the culprit it was i who ordered the banns to be cried oh papa you had no right to do such a thing as that i think i had i exercised parental authority for once and for your good and for the good of a true and faithful lover of yours whom you jilted once and now you trifle with his affection and his interests he loves you too well to leave you yet you know his vast estates and interests require supervision that for his vast estates said rosa contemptuously i am not to be driven to the altar like this when my heart is in the grave dont you do it again papa or ill get up and forbid the banns affront for affront i should like to see that said the old gentleman dryly rosa vouchsafed no reply but swept out of the room with burning cheeks and glittering eyes and was not seen all day would not dine with them in spite of three humble deprecating notes falcon sent her let the spiteful cat alone said old lusignan you and i will dine together in peace and quiet it was a dull dinner but falcon took advantage of the opportunity impregnated the father with his views and got him to promise to have the banns cried next sunday he consented rosa learned next sunday morning that this was to be done and her courage failed her she did not go to church at all she cried a great deal and submitted to violence as your true women are too apt to do they had compromised her and so conquered her the permanent feelings of gratitude and esteem caused a reaction after her passion and she gave up open resistance as hopeless falcon renewed his visits and was received with the mere sullen languor of a woman who has given in the banns were cried a third time then the patient rosa bought laudanum enough to reunite her to her christopher in spite of them all and having provided herself with this resource became more cheerful and even kind and caressing she declined to name the day at present and that was awkward nevertheless the conspirators felt sure they should tire her out into doing that before long for they saw their way clear and she was perplexed in the extreme in her perplexity she used to talk to a certain beautiful star she called her christopher she loved to fancy he was now an inhabitant of that bright star and often on a clear night she would look up and beg for guidance from this star this i consider foolish but then i am old and sceptical she was still young and innocent and sorely puzzled to know her husbands real will i dont suppose the star had anything to do with it except as a focus of her thoughts but one fine night after a long inspection of christophers star she dreamed a dream she thought that a lovely weddingdress hung over a chair that a crown of diamonds as large as almonds sparkled ready for her on the dressingtable and she was undoing her black gown and about to take it off when suddenly the diamonds began to pale and the white satin dress to melt away and in its place there rose a pale face and a long beard and christopher staines stood before her and said quietly is this how you keep your vow then he sank slowly and the white dress was black and the diamonds were jet and she awoke with his gentle words of remonstrance and his very tones ringing in her ear this dream cooperating with her previous agitation and misgivings shook her very much she did not come downstairs till near dinnertime and both her father and falcon who came as a matter of course to spend his sunday were struck with her appearance she was pale gloomy morose and had an air of desperation about her falcon would not see it he knew that it is safest to let her sex alone when they look like that and then the storm sometimes subsides of itself after dinner rosa retired early and soon she was heard walking rapidly up and down the dressingroom this was quite unusual and made a noise papa lusignan thought it inconsiderate and after a while remarking gently that he was not particularly fond of sound he proposed they should smoke the pipe of peace on the lawn they did so but after a while finding that falcon was not smoking he said dont let me detain you rosa is alone falcon took the hint and went to the drawingroom rosa met him on the stairs with a scarf over her shoulders i must speak to papa said she where is he he is on the lawn dear rosa said falcon in his most dulcet tones he was sure of his ally and very glad to use him as a buffer to receive the first shock so he went into the drawingroom where all the lights were burning and quietly took up a book but he did not read a line he was too occupied in trying to read his own future the mean villain who is incapable of remorse is of all men most capable of fear his villany had to all appearance reached the goal for he felt sure that all rosas struggles would sooner or later succumb to her sense of gratitude and his strong will and patient temper but when the victory was won what a life he must fly with her to some foreign country pursued from pillar to post by an enraged husband and by the offended law and if he escaped the vindictive foe a year or two how could he escape that other enemy he knew and dreadedpoverty he foresaw he should come to hate the woman he was about to wrong and she would instantly revenge herself by making him an exile and soon or late a prisoner or a pauper while these misgivings battled with his base but ardent passion strange things were going on out of doorsbut they will be best related in another sequence of events to which indeed they fairly belong chapter xxix staines and mrs falcon landed at plymouth and went up to town by the same train they parted in london staines to go down to gravesend mrs falcon to visit her husbands old haunts and see if she could find him she did not find him but she heard of him and learned that he always went down to gravesend from saturday till monday notwithstanding all she had said to staines the actual information startled her and gave her a turn she was obliged to sit down for her knees seemed to give way it was but a momentary weakness she was now a wife and a mother and had her rights she said to herself my rogue has turned that poor womans head long before this no doubt but i shall go down and just bring him away by the ear for once her bitter indignation overpowered every other sentiment and she lost no time but late as it was went down to gravesend ordered a private sittingroom and bedroom for the night and took a fly to kent villa but christopher staines had the start of her he had already gone down to gravesend with his carpetbag left it at the inn and walked to kent villa that lovely summer night the happiest husband in england his heart had never for one instant been disturbed by mrs falcons monstrous suspicion he looked on her as a monomaniac a sensible woman insane on one point her husband when he reached the villa however he thought it prudent to make sure that falcon had come to england at all and discharged his commission he would not run the risk small as he thought it of pouncing unexpected on his rosa being taken for a ghost and terrifying her or exciting her to madness now the premises of kent villa were admirably adapted to what they call in war a reconnaissance the lawn was studded with laurestinas and other shrubs that had grown magnificently in that kentish air staines had no sooner set his foot on the lawn than he heard voices he crept towards them from bush to bush and standing in impenetrable shade he saw in the clear moonlight two figuresmr lusignan and reginald falcon these two dropped out only a word or two at intervals but what they did say struck staines as odd for one thing lusignan remarked i suppose you will want to go back to the cape such enormous estates as yours will want looking after enormous estates said staines to himself then they must have grown very fast in a few months oh yes said falcon but i think of showing her a little of europe first staines thought this still more mysterious he waited to hear more but the succeeding remarks were of an ordinary kind he noticed however that falcon spoke of his wife by her christian name and that neither party mentioned christopher staines he seemed quite out of their little world he began to feel a strange chill creep down him presently falcon went off to join rosa and staines thought it was quite time to ask the old gentleman whether falcon had executed his commission or not he was only hesitating how to do it not liking to pounce in the dark on a man who abhorred everything like excitement when rosa herself came flying out in great agitation oh the thrill he felt at the sight of her with all his selfpossession he would have sprung forward and taken her in his arms with a mighty cry of love if she had not immediately spoken words that rooted him to the spot with horror but she came with the words in her very mouth papa i am come to tell you i cannot and will not marry mr falcon oh yes you will my dear never ill die sooner not that you will care for that i tell you i saw my christopher last nightin a dream he had a beard but i saw him oh so plain and he said is this the way you keep your promise that is enough for me i have prayed again and again to his star for light i am so perplexed and harassed by you all and you make me believe what you like well i have had a revelation it is not my poor lost darlings wish i should wed again i dont believe mr falcon any more i hear nothing but lies by day the truth comes to my bedside at night i will not marry this man consider rosa your credit is pledged you must not be always jilting him heartlessly dreams nonsense therei love peace it is no use your storming at me rave to the moon and the stars if you like and when you have done do pray come in and behave like a rational woman who has pledged her faith to an honorable man and a man of vast estatesa man that nursed your husband in his last illness found your child at a great expense when you had lost him and merits eternal gratitude not eternal jilting i have no patience with you the old gentleman retired in high dudgeon staines stood in the black shade of his cedartree rooted to the ground by this revelation of male villany and female credulity he did not know what on earth to do he wanted to kill falcon but not to terrify his own wife to death it was now too clear she thought he was dead rosa watched her fathers retiring figure out of sight very well said she clenching her teeth then suddenly she turned and looked up to heaven do you hear said she my christies star i am a poor perplexed creature i asked you for a sign and that very night i saw him in a dream why should i marry out of gratitude why should i marry one man when i love another what does it matter his being dead i love him too well to be wife to any living man they persuade me they coax me they pull me they push me i see they will make me but i will outwit them seesee and she held up a little phial in the moonlight this shall cut the knot for me this shall keep me true to my christie and save me from breaking promises i ought never to have made this shall unite me once more with him i killed and loved she meant she would kill herself the night before the wedding which perhaps she would not and perhaps she would who can tell the weak are violent but christopher seeing the poison so near her lips was perplexed took two strides wrenched it out of her hand with a snarl of rage and instantly plunged into the shade again rosa uttered a shriek and flew into the house the farther she got the more terrified she became and soon christopher heard her screaming in the drawingroom in an alarming way they were like the screams of the insane he got terribly anxious and followed her all the doors were open as he went upstairs he heard her cry his ghost his ghost i have seen his ghost no no i feel his hand upon my arm now a beard and so he had in the dream he is alive my darling is alive you have deceived me you are an impostora villain out of the house this moment or he shall kill you are you mad cried falcon how can he be alive when i saw him dead this was too much staines gave the door a blow with his arm and strode into the apartment looking white and tremendous falcon saw death in his face gave a shriek drew his revolver and fired at him with as little aim as he had at the lioness then made for the open window staines seized a chair followed him and hurled it at him and the chair and the man went through the window together and then there was a strange thud heard outside rosa gave a loud scream and swooned away staines laid his wife flat on the floor got the women about her and at last she began to give the usual signs of returning life staines said to the oldest woman there if she sees me she will go off again carry her to her room and tell her by degrees that i am alive all this time papa lusignan had sat trembling and whimpering in a chair moaning this is a painful scenevery painful but at last an idea struck himwhy you have robbed the office scarcely was mrs staines out of the room when a fly drove up and this was immediately followed by violent and continuous screaming close under the window oh dear sighed papa lusignan they ran down and found falcon impaled at full length on the spikes of the villa and phoebe screaming over him and trying in vain to lift him off them he had struggled a little in silent terror but had then fainted from fear and loss of blood and lying rather inside the rails which were high he could not be extricated from the outside as soon as his miserable condition was discovered the servants ran down into the kitchen and so up to the rails by the area steps these rails had caught him one had gone clean through his arm the other had penetrated the fleshy part of the thigh and a third pierced his ear they got him off but he was insensible and the place drenched with his blood phoebe clutched staines by the arm let me know the worst said she is he dead staines examined him and said no can you save him i yes who can if you cannot oh have mercy on me and she went on her knees to him and put her forehead on his knees he was touched by her simple faith and the noble traditions of his profession sided with his gratitude to this injured woman my poor friend said he i will do my best for your sake he took immediate steps for stanching the blood and the fly carried phoebe and her villain to the inn at gravesend falcon came to on the road but finding himself alone with phoebe shammed unconsciousness of everything but pain staines being thoroughly enraged with rosa yet remembering his solemn vow never to abuse her again saw her father and told him to tell her he should think over her conduct quietly not wishing to be harder upon her than she deserved rosa who had been screaming and crying for joy ever since she came to her senses was not so much afflicted at this message as one might have expected he was alive and all things else were trifles nevertheless when day after day went by and not even a line from christopher she began to fear he would cast her off entirely the more so as she heard he was now and then at gravesend to visit mrs falcon at the inn while matters were thus uncle philip burst on her like a bomb he is alive he is alive he is alive and they had a cuddle over it oh uncle philip have you seen him seen him yes he caught me on the hop just as i came in from italy i took him for a ghost oh werent you frightened not a bit i dont mind ghosts id have half a dozen to dinner every day if i might choose em i couldnt stand stupid ones but i say his temper isnt improved by all this dying he is in an awful rage with you and what for o uncle what for because im the vilest of women vilest of fiddlesticks its his fault not yours shouldnt have died its always a dangerous experiment i shall die if he will not forgive me he keeps away from me and from his child ill tell you he heard in gravesend your banns had been cried that has moved the peevish fellows bile it was done without my consent papa will tell you so and o uncle if you knew the arts the forged letter in my darlings hand the way he wrought on me o villain villain uncle forgive your poor silly niece that the world is too wicked and too clever for her to live in because you are too good and innocent said uncle philip there dont you be downhearted ill soon bring you two together againa couple of ninnies ill tell you what is the first thing you must come and live with me come at once bag and baggage he wont show here the sulky brute philip staines had a large house in cavendish square a crusty old patient like himself had left him it was his humor to live in a corner of this mansion though the whole was capitally furnished by his judicious purchases at auctions he gave rosa and her boy and his nurse the entire first floor and told her she was there for life look here said he this last affair has opened my eyes such women as you are the sweeteners of existence you leave my roof no more your husband will make the same discovery let him run about and be miserable a bit he will have to come to book she shook her head sadly my christopher will never say a harsh word to me all the worse for me he will quietly abandon a creature so inferior to him stuff now she was always running to the window in hope that christopher would call on his uncle and that she might see him and one day she gave a scream so eloquent philip knew what it meant get you behind that screen you and your boy said he and be as still as mice stop give me that letter the scoundrel forged and the ring this was hardly done and rosa out of sight and trembling from head to foot when christopher was announced philip received him very affectionately but wasted no time been to kent villa yet no was the grim reply why not because i have sworn never to say an angry word to her again and if i was to go there i should say a good many angry ones oh when i think that her folly drove me to sea to do my best for her and that i was nearer death for that woman than ever man was and lost my reason for her and went through toil and privations hunger exile mainly for her and then to find the banns cried in open church with that scoundrelsay no more uncle i shall never reproach her and never forgive her she was deceived i dont doubt that but nobody has a right to be so great a fool as all that it was not her folly but her innocence that was imposed on you a philosopher and not know that wisdom itself is sometimes imposed on and deceived by cunning folly have you forgotten your milton at wisdoms gate suspicion sleeps and deems no ill where no ill seems come come are you sure you are not a little to blame did you write home the moment you found you were not dead christopher colored high evidently not said the keen old man ah my fine fellow have i found the flaw in your own armor i did wrong but it was for her i sinned for her i could not bear her to be without money and i knew the insurancei sinned for her she has sinned against me and she had much better have sinned against god hadnt she he is more forgiving than we perfect creatures that cheat insurance companies and so my fine fellow you hid the truth from her for two or three months no answer strike off those two or three months would the banns have ever been cried well uncle said christopher hard pressed i am glad she has got a champion and i hope you will always keep your eye on her i mean to goodmorning no dont be in a hurry i have something else to say not so provoking do you know the arts by which she was made to believe you wished her to marry again i wished her to marry again are you mad uncle whose handwriting is on this envelope mine to be sure now read the letter christopher read the forged letter oh monstrous this was given her with your ruby ring and a tale so artful that nothing we read about the devil comes near it this was what did it the earl of tadcaster brought her title and wealth and love what he too the little cub i saved and lost myself forblank him blank him why you stupid ninny you forget you were dead and he could not help loving her how could he well but you see she refused him and why because he came without a forged letter from you do you doubt her love for you of course i do she never loved me as i loved her christopher dont you say that before me or you and i shall quarrel poor girl she lay in my sight as near death for you as you were for her ill show you something he went to a cabinet and took out a silver paper he unpinned it and laid rosas beautiful black hair upon her husbands knees look at that you hardhearted brute he roared to christopher who sat anything but hardhearted his eyes filling fast at the sad proof of his wifes love and suffering rosa could bear no more she came out with her boy in her hand o uncle do not speak harshly to him or you will kill me quite she came across the room a picture of timidity and penitence with her whole eloquent body bent forward at an angle she kneeled at his knees with streaming eyes and held her boy up to him plead for your poor mother my darling she mourns her fault and will never excuse it the cause was soon decided all philips logic was nothing compared with mighty nature christopher gave one great sob and took his darling to his heart without one word and he and rosa clung together and cried over each other philip slipped out of the room and left the restored ones together i have something more to say about my hero and heroine but must first deal with other characters not wholly uninteresting to the reader i hope dr staines directed phoebe falcon how to treat her husband no medicine no stimulants very wholesome food in moderation and the temperature of the body regulated by tepid water under these instructions the injured but still devoted wife was the real healer he pulled through but was lame for life and ridiculously lame for he went with a spring halta sort of hopandgoone that made the girls laugh and vexed adonis phoebe found the diamonds and offered them all to staines in expiation of his villany see she said he has only spent one staines said he was glad of it for her sake for he must be just to his own family he sold them for three thousand two hundred pounds but for the big diamond he got twelve thousand pounds and i believe it was worth double the money counting the two sums and deducting six hundred for the stone mr falcon had embezzled he gave her over seven thousand pounds she stared at him and changed color at so large a sum but i have no claim on that sir that is a good joke said he why you and i are partners in the whole thingyou and i and dick was it not with his horse and rifle i bought the big diamond poor dear honest manly dick no the money is honestly yours mrs falcon but dont trust a penny to your husband he will never see it sir i shall take him back and give him all his heart can ask for with this but he will be little more than a servant in the house now as long as dick is single i know that and she could still cry at the humiliation of her villain staines made her promise to write to him and she did write him a sweet womanly letter to say that they were making an enormous fortune and hoped to end their days in england dick sent his kind love and thanks i will add what she only said by implication that she was happy after all she still contrived to love the thing she could not respect once when an officious friend pitied her for her husbands lameness she said find me a face like his the lamer the better he cant run after the girls like some dr staines called on lady cicely treherne the footman stared he left his card a week afterwards she called on him she had a pink tinge in her cheeks a general animation and her face full of brightness and archness bless me said he bluntly is this you how you are improved yes said she and i am come to thank you for your pwescwiption i followed it to the lettaa woe is me i have forgotten it you diwected me to mawwy a nice man never i hate a nice man no noan iwishman and i have done it good gracious you dont mean that i must be more cautious in my prescriptions after all it seems to agree admiwably he loves you to distwaction he amuses you pwodigiously come and see dr and mrs staines live with uncle philip the insurance money is returned but the diamond money makes them very easy staines follows his profession now under great advantages a noble house rent free the curiosity that attaches to a man who has been canted out of a ship in midocean and lives to tell it and then lord tadcaster married into another noble house swears by him and talks of him so does lady cicely munster late treherne and when such friends as these are warm it makes a physician the centre of an important clientele but his best friend of all is his unflagging industry and his truly wonderful diagnosis which resembles divination he has the ball at his feet and above all that without which worldly success soon palls a happy home a fireside warm with sympathy mrs staines is an admiring sympathizing wife and an admirable housekeeper she still utters inadvertencies now and then commits new errors at odd times but never repeats them when exposed observing which docility uncle philip has been heard to express a fear that in twenty years she will be the wisest woman in england but thank heaven he adds i shall be gone before that her conduct and conversation afford this cynic constant food for observation and he has delivered himself oracularly at various stages of the study but i cannot say that his observations taken as a whole present that consistency which entitles them to be regarded as a body of philosophy examples in the second month after mrs staines came to live with him he delivered himself thus my niece rosa is an anomaly she gives you the impression she is shallow mind your eye in one moment she will take you out of your depth or any mans depth she is like those country streams i used to fish for pike when i was young you go along seeing the bottom everywhere but presently you come to a corner and it is fifteen deep all in a moment and souse you go over head and ears thats my niece rosa in six months he had got to thisand mind you each successive dogma was delivered in a loud aggressive tone and in sublime oblivion of the preceding oraclemy niece rosa is the most artful woman you may haw haw haw as much as you like you have not found out her little gamei have what is the aim of all women to be beloved by an unconscionable number of people well she sets up for a simpleton and so disarms all the brilliant people and they love her everybody loves her just you put her down in a room with six clever women and you will see who is the favorite she looks as shallow as a pond and she is as deep as the ocean at the end of the year he threw off the mask altogether the great sweetener of a mans life said he is a simpleton i shall not go abroad any more my house has become attractive ive got a simpleton when i have a headache her eyes fill with tender concern and she hovers about me and pesters me with pillows when i am cross with her she is afraid i am ill when i die and leave her a lot of money she will howl for months and say i dont want his money i wawwawwawwawwant my uncle philip to love me and scold me one day she told me with a sigh i hadnt lectured her for a month i am afraid i have offended you says she or else worn you out dear when i am well give me a simpleton to make me laugh when i am ill give me a simpleton to soothe me with her innocent tenderness a simpleton shall wipe the dews of death and close my eyes and when i cross the river of death let me be met by a band of the heavenly host who were all simpletons here on earth and too good for such a hole so now they are in heaven and their garments always whitebecause there are no laundresses there arrived at this point the anglosaxon race will retire grinning to fresh pastures and leave this champion of a simpleton to thunder paradoxes in a desert

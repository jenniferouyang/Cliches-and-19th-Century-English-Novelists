elizabeth to renew entreaty must write often to bestow last feminine attention on playmate friend threw into chaise be to convey away indulged in most melancholy reflection who have ever be surrounded by amiable companion continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasurei be now alone in university whither be going must form own friend be own protector life have hitherto be remarkably secluded domestic have given invincible repugnance to new countenance loved brother elizabeth clerval be old familiar face believed totally unfitted for company of stranger such be reflection a commenced journey a proceeded spirit hope rose ardently desired acquisition of knowledge have often when at home thought hard to remain during youth cooped up in one place have longed to enter world take station among other human being now desire be complied with must indeed have be folly to repent have sufficient leisure for many other reflection during journey to ingolstadt be long fatiguing at high white steeple of town met eye alighted be conducted to solitary apartment to spend evening a pleased next morning delivered letter of introduction paid visit to of principal professor chanceor rather evil influence angel of destruction asserted omnipotent sway over from moment turned reluctant step from father doorled first to m krempe professor of natural philosophy be uncouth man deeply imbued in secret of science asked several question concerning progress in different branch of science appertaining to natural philosophy replied carelessly partly in contempt mentioned name of alchemist a principal author have studied professor stared have said really spent time in studying such nonsense replied in affirmative minute continued m krempe with warmth instant that have wasted on book be utterly entirely lost have burdened memory with exploded system useless name good god in what desert land have lived where one be kind enough to inform that fancy have so greedily imbibed be thousand year old a musty a be ancient little expected in enlightened scientific age to find disciple of albertus magnus paracelsus dear sir must begin study entirely anew so saying stepped aside wrote down list of several book treating of natural philosophy desired to procure dismissed after mentioning that in beginning of following week intended to commence course of lecture upon natural philosophy in general relation m waldman fellow professor must lecture upon chemistry alternate day that omitted returned home not disappointed for have said that have long considered author useless whom professor reprobated returned not at more inclined to recur to study in shape m krempe be little squat man with gruff voice repulsive countenance teacher therefore did not prepossess in favour of pursuit in rather too philosophical connected strain perhaps have given account of conclusion have come to concerning in early year a child have not be content with result promised by modern professor of natural science with confusion of idea only to be accounted for by extreme youth want of guide on such matter have retrod step of knowledge along path of time exchanged discovery of recent inquirer for dream of forgotten alchemist besides have contempt for us of modern natural philosophy be very different when master of science sought immortality power such view although futile be grand now scene be changed ambition of inquirer seemed to limit to annihilation of vision on interest in science be chiefly founded be required to exchange chimera of boundless grandeur for reality of little worth such be reflection during first two three day of residence at ingolstadt be chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with locality principal resident in new abode a ensuing week commenced thought of information m krempe have given concerning lecture although must not consent to go hear little conceited fellow deliver sentence out of pulpit recollected what have said of m waldman whom have never seen a have hitherto be out of town partly from curiosity partly from idleness went into lecturing room m waldman entered shortly after professor be very unlike colleague appeared about fifty year of age with aspect expressive of greatest benevolence few grey hair covered temple at back of head be nearly black person be short remarkably erect voice sweetest have ever heard began lecture by recapitulation of history of chemistry various improvement made by different men of learning pronouncing with name of most distinguished discoverer then took cursory view of present state of science explained many of elementary term after having made few preparatory experiment concluded with panegyric upon modern chemistry term of will never forget ancient teacher of science said promised impossibility performed nothing modern master promise very little know that metal can not be transmuted that elixir of life be chimera philosopher whose hand seem only made to dabble in dirt eye to pore over microscope crucible have indeed performed miracle penetrate into recess of nature show how work in hiding place ascend into heaven have discovered how blood circulates nature of air breathe have acquired new almost unlimited power can command thunder of heaven mimic earthquake even mock invisible world with own shadow such be professor wordsrather let say such word of fateenounced to

conception one purpose so much have be done exclaimed soul of frankensteinmore far more will achieve treading in step already marked will pioneer new way explore unknown power unfold to world deepest mystery of creation closed not eye that night internal being be in state of insurrection turmoil felt that order must thence arise have power to produce by degree after morning dawn sleep came awoke yesternights thought be a dream there only remained resolution to return to ancient study to devote to science for believed to posse natural talent on same day paid m waldman visit manner in private be even more mild attractive than in public for there be certain dignity in mien during lecture in own house be replaced by greatest affability kindness gave pretty nearly same account of former pursuit a have given to fellow professor heard with attention little narration concerning study smiled at name of cornelius agrippa paracelsus without contempt m krempe have exhibited said that be men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosopher be indebted for most of foundation of knowledge have left to a easier task to give new name arrange in connected classification fact in great degree have be instrument of bringing to light labour of men of genius however erroneously directed scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to solid advantage of mankind listened to statement be delivered without presumption affectation then added that lecture have removed prejudice against modern chemist expressed in measured term with modesty deference due from youth to instructor without letting escape inexperience in life must have made ashamed of enthusiasm stimulated intended labour requested advice concerning book ought to procure be happy said m waldman to have gained disciple if application equal ability have doubt of success chemistry be that branch of natural philosophy in greatest improvement have be may be made be on account have made peculiar study at same time have not neglected other branch of science man must make very sorry chemist if attended to department of human knowledge alone if wish be to become really man of science not merely petty experimentalist must advise to apply to branch of natural philosophy including mathematics then took into laboratory explained to us of various machine instructing a to what ought to procure promising use of own when must have advanced far enough in science not to derange mechanism also gave list of book have requested took leave thus ended day memorable to decided future destiny chapter from day natural philosophy particularly chemistry in most comprehensive sense of term became nearly sole occupation read with ardour work so full of genius discrimination modern inquirer have written on subject attended lecture cultivated acquaintance of men of science of university found even in m krempe great deal of sound sense real information combined be true with repulsive physiognomy manner not on account le valuable in m waldman found true friend gentleness be never tinged by dogmatism instruction be given with air of frankness good nature banished idea of pedantry in thousand way smoothed for path of knowledge made most abstruse inquiry clear facile to apprehension application be at first fluctuating uncertain gained strength a proceeded soon became so ardent eager that star often disappeared in light of morning whilst be yet engaged in laboratory a applied so closely may be easily conceived that progress be rapid ardour be indeed astonishment of student proficiency that of master professor krempe often asked with sly smile how cornelius agrippa went on whilst m waldman expressed most heartfelt exultation in progress two year passed in manner during paid visit to geneva be engaged heart soul in pursuit of discovery hoped to make none who have experienced can conceive of enticement of science in other study go a far a others have gone before there be nothing more to know in scientific pursuit there be continual food for discovery wonder mind of moderate capacity closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in study who continually sought attainment of one object of pursuit be solely wrapped up in improved so rapidly that at end of two year made discovery in improvement of chemical instrument procured great esteem admiration at university when have arrived at point have become a well acquainted with theory practice of natural philosophy a depended on lesson of of professor at ingolstadt residence there being longer conducive to improvement thought of returning to friend native town when incident happened that protracted stay one of phenomenon have peculiarly attracted attention be structure of human frame indeed animal endued with life whence often asked did principle of life proceed be bold question one have ever be considered a mystery yet with how many thing be upon brink of becoming acquainted if cowardice carelessness did not restrain inquiry revolved circumstance in mind determined thenceforth to apply more particularly to branch of natural philosophy relate to physiology unless have be animated by almost supernatural enthusiasm application to study must have be irksome almost intolerable to examine cause of life must first have recourse to death became acquainted with science of anatomy be not sufficient must also observe natural decay corruption of human body in education father have taken greatest precaution that mind must be impressed with supernatural horror ever remember to have trembled at tale of superstition to

examine cause progress of decay forced to spend day night in vault charnel house attention be fixed upon object most insupportable to delicacy of human feeling saw how fine form of man be degraded wasted beheld corruption of death succeed to blooming cheek of life saw how worm inherited wonder of eye brain paused examining analysing minutia of causation a exemplified in change from life to death death to life until from midst of darkness sudden light broke in upon mea light so brilliant wondrous yet so simple that while became dizzy with immensity of prospect illustrated be surprised that among so many men of genius who have directed inquiry towards same science that alone must be reserved to discover so astonishing secret remember be not recording vision of madman sun doe not more certainly shine in heaven than now affirm be true miracle might have produced yet stage of discovery be distinct probable after day night of incredible labour fatigue succeeded in discovering cause of generation life nay more became capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter astonishment have at first experienced on discovery soon gave place to delight rapture after so much time spent in painful labour to arrive at once at summit of desire be most gratifying consummation of toil discovery be so great overwhelming that step by have be progressively led to be obliterated beheld

thought that father must be unjust if ascribed neglect to vice faultiness on part be now convinced that be justified in conceiving must not be altogether free from blame human being in perfection ought always to preserve calm peaceful mind never to allow passion transitory desire to disturb tranquillity think that pursuit of knowledge be exception to rule if study to apply have tendency to

remained minute with eye fixed on coach be coming towards from other end of street a drew nearer observed that be swiss diligence stopped just where be standing on door being opened perceived henry clerval who on seeing instantly sprung out dear frankenstein exclaimed how glad be to see how fortunate that must be here at very moment of alighting nothing must equal delight on seeing clerval presence brought back to thought father elizabeth scene of home so dear to recollection grasped hand in moment forgot horror misfortune felt suddenly for first time during many month calm serene joy welcomed friend therefore in most cordial manner walked towards college clerval continued talking for time about mutual friend own good fortune in being permitted to come to ingolstadt may easily believe said how great be difficulty to persuade father that necessary knowledge be not comprised in noble art of book keeping indeed believe left incredulous to last for constant answer to unwearied entreaty be same a of dutch schoolmaster in vicar of wakefield have ten thousand florin year without greek eat heartily without greek affection for at length overcame dislike of learning have permitted to undertake voyage of discovery to land of knowledge give greatest delight to see tell how left father brother elizabeth very well very happy only little uneasy that hear from so seldom by by mean to lecture little upon account dear frankenstein continued stopping short gazing full in face did not before remark how very ill appear so thin pale look a if have be watching for several night have guessed right have lately be so deeply engaged in one occupation have not allowed sufficient rest a see hope sincerely hope that employment be now at end be at length free trembled excessively must not endure to think of far le to allude to occurrence of preceding night walked with quick pace soon arrived at college then reflected thought made shiver that creature whom have left in apartment might still be there alive walking about dreaded to behold monster feared still more that henry must see entreating therefore to remain few minute at bottom of stair darted up towards own room hand be already on lock of door before recollected then paused cold shivering came over threw door forcibly open a child be accustomed to do when expect spectre to stand in waiting for on other side nothing appeared stepped fearfully in apartment be empty bedroom be also freed from hideous guest must hardly believe that so great good fortune must have befallen when became assured that enemy have indeed fled clapped hand for joy ran down to clerval ascended into room servant presently brought breakfast be unable to contain be not joy only that possessed felt flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness pulse beat rapidly be unable to remain for single instant in same place jumped over chair clapped hand laughed aloud clerval at first attributed unusual spirit to joy on arrival when observed more attentively saw wildness in eye for must not account loud unrestrained heartless laughter frightened astonished dear victor cried what for god sake be matter laugh in manner how ill be what be cause of ask cried putting hand before eye for thought saw dreaded spectre glide into room can tell oh save save imagined that monster seized struggled furiously fell down in fit poor clerval what must have be feeling meeting anticipated with such joy so strangely turned to bitterness be not witness of grief for be lifeless did not recover sens for long long time be commencement of nervous fever confined for several month during time henry be only nurse afterwards learned that knowing father advanced age unfitness for so long journey how wretched sickness must make elizabeth spared grief by concealing extent of disorder knew must not have more kind attentive nurse than firm in hope felt of recovery did not doubt that instead of doing harm performed kindest action that must towards be in reality very ill surely nothing unbounded unremitting attention of friend must have restored to life form of monster on whom have bestowed existence be for ever before eye raved incessantly concerning doubtless word surprised henry at first believed to be wandering of disturbed imagination pertinacity with continually recurred to same subject persuaded that disorder indeed owed origin to uncommon terrible event by very slow degree with frequent relapse alarmed grieved friend recovered remember first time became capable of observing outward object with kind of pleasure perceived that fallen leaf have disappeared that young bud be shooting forth from tree shaded window be divine spring season contributed greatly to convalescence felt also sentiment of joy affection revive in bosom gloom disappeared in short time became a cheerful a before be attacked by fatal passion dearest clerval exclaimed how kind how very good be to whole winter instead of being spent in study a promised have be consumed in sick room how will ever repay feel greatest remorse for disappointment of have be occasion will forgive will repay entirely if discompose get well a fast a can since appear in such good spirit may speak to on one subject may not trembled one subject must be must allude to object on whom dared not even think compose said clerval who observed change of colour will not mention if agitates father cousin must be very happy if received letter from in own handwriting hardly know how ill have be be uneasy at long silence be that dear henry how must suppose that first thought must not fly towards dear dear friend whom love who be so deserving of love if be present temper friend will perhaps be glad to see letter have be lying here day for be from cousin

sickbed have devolved on mercenary old nurse who must never guess wish minister to with care affection of poor cousin yet be over now clerval writes that indeed be getting better eagerly hope that will confirm intelligence soon in own handwriting get welland return to will find happy cheerful home friend who love dearly father health be vigorous asks to see to be assured that be well not care will ever cloud benevolent countenance how pleased must be to remark improvement of ernest be now sixteen full of activity spirit be desirous to be true swiss to enter into foreign service can not

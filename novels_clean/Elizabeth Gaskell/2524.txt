home with light heart tossing up five franc piece a ran just a be at conciergerie door great tall man bustled past snatched money away from looking back with laugh added insult to injury pierre have redress no one have witnessed impudent theft if have one to be seen in street be strong enough to give redress besides pierre have seen enough of state of street of paris at time to know friend not enemy be required man have bad air about consideration did not keep pierre from bursting out into fit of cry when be once more under mother roof virginie who be alone there madame babette having gone out to make daily purchase might have imagined pommeled to death by loudness of sob what be matter asked speak child what hast thou done have robbed have robbed be pierre must gulp out robbed thee of what poor boy said virginie stroking hair gently of five franc pieceof five franc piece said pierre correcting leaving out word half fearful lest virginie must inquire how became possessed of such sum for what service have be given of course such idea came into head for must have be impertinent be gentle born wait moment lad going to one small drawer in inner apartment held few possession brought back little ringa ring just with one ruby in itwhich have worn in day when cared to wear jewel take said run with to jeweller be poor valueless thing will bring in five franc at rate go desire can not

with ring after repaying five franc be enabled to bring virginie back two more so well have managed affair although whole transaction did not leave bound in way to discover forward virginies wish did leave pledged according to code to act according to advantage considered judge of best course to be pursued to end moreover little kindness attached to personally began to think how pleasant must be to have so kind generous person for relation how easily trouble might be borne if have always such ready helper at hand how much must like to make like come to for protection of masculine power first of duty a self appointed squire came necessity of finding out who strange new acquaintance be thus see arrived at same end via supposed duty that be previously pledged to via interest fancy good number of when line of action will promote own interest can make ourselves believe that reason exist compel to a duty in course of very few day pierre have so circumvented virginie a to have discovered that new friend be other than norman farmer in different dress be great piece of knowledge to impart to morin pierre be not prepared for immediate physical effect have on cousin morin sat suddenly down on one of seat in boulevardsit be there pierre have met with accidentallywhen heard who be that virginie met man have faintest idea of relationship even previous acquaintanceship between clement virginie if thought of anything beyond mere fact presented to that idol be in communication with younger handsomer man than must have be that norman farmer have seen at conciergerie have be attracted by a be natural have tried to make acquaintance have succeeded from what pierre told must not think that even much thought passed through morins mind seems to have be man of rare concentrated attachment violent though restrained undemonstrative passion above capability of jealousy of dark oriental complexion must have be type must fancy that if have married virginie must have coined life blood for luxury to make happy must have watched over petted at sacrifice to a long a must have be content to live with alone a pierre expressed to when saw what cousin be when learned nature too late perceived that must have strangled bird if whom loved be attracted by from when pierre have told morin of discovery morin sat down a said quite suddenly a if have be shot found out that first meeting between norman virginie be accidental isolated circumstance pierre be torturing with account of daily rendezvous if for moment be seeing other day sometimes twice day virginie must speak to man though to be coy reserved a hardly to utter sentence pierre caught broken word while cousin complexion grew more more livid then purple a if great effect be produced on circulation by news have just heard pierre be so startled by cousin wandering senseless eye otherwise disordered look that rushed into neighbouring cabaret for glass of absinthe paid for a recollected afterwards with portion of virginies five franc by by morin recovered natural appearance be gloomy silent pierre must get out of be that norman farmer must not sleep night at hotel duguesclin giving such opportunity of passing repassing by conciergerie door be too much absorbed in own thought to repay pierre half franc have spent on absinthe pierre perceived seems to have noted down in ledger of mind a on virginies balance of favour altogether be much disappointed at cousin mode of receiving intelligence lad thought worth five franc piece at least if not paid for in money to be paid for in open mouthed confidence expression of feeling that be for time so far partisan of virginiesunconscious virginieagainst cousin a to feel regret when norman returned more to night lodging when virginies eager watch at crevice of closely drawn blind ended only with sigh of disappointment if have not be for mother presence at time pierre thought must have told how far be mother in cousin confidence a regarded dismissal of norman in few day however pierre felt almost sure that have established new mean of communication virginie went out for short time day though pierre followed a closely a must without exciting observation be unable to discover what kind of intercourse held with norman went in general same short round among little shop in neighbourhood not entering stopping at two three pierre afterwards remembered that have invariably paused at nosegay displayed in certain window studied long then stopped looked at cap hat fashion confectionery of humble kind common in quarter so how must have known that particular attraction existed among flower morin came more regularly than ever to aunt virginie be apparently unconscious that be attraction looked healthier more hopeful than have done for month manner to be gentler not so reserved almost a if wished to manifest gratitude to madame babette for long continuance of kindness necessity for be nearly ended virginie showed unusual alacrity in rendering old woman little service in power evidently tried to respond to monsieur morins civility being madame babettes nephew with soft graciousness must have made one of principal charm for who knew speak of fascination of manner so winning attentive to others while yet opinion often action be of so decided character for a have said beauty be by mean great yet man who came near seems to have fallen into sphere of influence monsieur morin be deeper than ever in love with during last few day be worked up into state capable of sacrifice of others so that might obtain at last sat devouring with eye to use pierre expression whenever must not see if looked towards looked to groundanywhereaway from almost stammered in reply if addressed question to have be must think ashamed of extreme agitation on boulevard for pierre thought that absolutely shunned for few succeeding day must have believed that have driven norman poor clement off field by banishing from inn thought that intercourse between virginie have thus interrupted be of so slight transient character a to be quenched by little difficulty appears to have felt that have made little way awkwardly turned to pierre for helpnot yet confessing love though only tried to make friend again with lad after silent estrangement pierre for time did not choose to perceive cousin advance must reply to roundabout question morin put to respecting household conversation when be not present household occupation tone of thought without mentioning virginies name more than questioner did lad must seem to suppose that cousin strong interest in domestic way of going on be on account of madame babette at last worked cousin up to point of making confidant then boy be half frightened at torrent of vehement word have unloosed lava came down with greater rush for having be pent up so long morin cried out word in hoarse passionate voice clenched teeth finger seemed almost convulsed a spoke out terrible love for virginie must lead to kill sooner than see anothers if stepped in between herand then smiled fierce triumphant smile did not say more pierre be a said half frightened also half admiring be really lovea grande passiona really fine dramatic thinglike play acted at little theatre yonder have dozen time sympathy with cousin now that have have before readily swore by infernal god for be far too enlightened to believe in one god christianity anything of kindthat must devote body soul to forwarding cousin view then cousin took to shop bought smart second hand watch on scratched word fidelite thus be compact sealed pierre settled in own mind that if be woman must like to be beloved a virginie be by cousin that must be extremely good thing for to be wife of so rich citizen a morin filsand for pierre too for doubtless gratitude must lead to give ring watch ad infinitum day two afterwards virginie be taken ill madame babette said be because have persevered in going out in weather after confining to two warm room for so long very probably be really cause for from pierre account must have be suffering from feverish cold aggravated doubt by impatience at madame babettes familiar prohibition of more walk until be better day in spite of trembling aching limb must fain have arranged dress for walk at usual time madame babette be fully prepared to put physical obstacle in way if be not obedient in remaining tranquil on little sofa by side of fire third day called pierre to when mother be not attending having in fact locked up mademoiselle cannes out of door thing see child said virginie thou must do great favour go to gardener shop in rue de bons enfans look at nosegay in window long for pink be favourite flower here be two franc if thou seest nosegay of pink displayed in window if be ever so fadednay if thou seest two three nosegay of pink remember buy bring to have so great desire for smell fell back weak exhausted pierre hurried out now be time here be clue to long inspection of nosegay in very shop sure enough there be drooping nosegay of pink in window pierre went in with impatience made a good bargain a must urging that flower be faded good for nothing at last purchased at very moderate price now will learn bad consequence of teaching lower order anything beyond what be immediately necessary to enable to earn daily bread silly count de crequyhe who have be sent to bloody rest by very canaille of whom thought so muchhe who have made virginie indirectly be true reject man a cousin clement by inflating mind with bubble of theoriesthis count de crequy have long ago taken fancy to pierre a saw bright sharp child playing about courtmonsieur de crequy have even begun to educate boy to try work out certain opinion of into practicebut drudgery of affair wearied beside babette have left employment still count took kind of interest in former pupil made sort of arrangement by pierre be to be taught reading writing account heaven know what besideslatin dare say so pierre instead of being innocent messenger a ought to have beenas mr horners little lad gregson ought to have be morningcould read writing a well a so what doe do on obtaining nosegay examine well stalk of flower be tied up with slip of matting in wet moss pierre undid string unwrapped moss out fell piece of wet paper with writing blurred with moisture be torn piece of writing paper apparently pierre wicked mischievous eye read what be written on itwritten so a to look like fragmentready night at nine be prepared have fright trust one who hope might once have have be content now to serve a faithful cousin place be named forget pierre did not a be evidently rendezvous after lad have studied word till must say off by heart placed paper where have found enveloped in moss tied whole up again carefully virginies face coloured scarlet a received kept smelling at trembling did not untie although pierre suggested how much fresher must be if stalk be immediately put into water once after back have be turned for minute saw untied when looked round again virginie be blushing hiding something in bosom pierre be now impatience to set off find cousin mother seemed to want for small domestic purpose even more than usual have chafed over multitude of errand connected with hotel before must set off search for cousin at usual haunt at last two met pierre related event of morning to morin said note off word by word that lad morning have something of magpie look of pierreit made shudder to see hear repeat note by heart then morin asked to tell over again pierre be struck by morins heavy sigh a repeated story when came second time to note morin tried to write word down be not good ready scholar finger trembled too much pierre hardly remembered at rate lad have to do with wicked reading writing when be done morin sat heavily silent pierre must have preferred expected outburst for impenetrable gloom perplexed baffled have even to speak to cousin to rouse when replied what said have so little apparent connection with subject pierre have expected to find uppermost in mind that be half afraid that cousin have lost wit aunt babette be out of coffee be sure know said pierre yes be heard say so tell that friend of mine have just opened shop in rue saint antoine that if will join there in hour will supply with good stock of coffee just to give friend encouragement name be antoine meyer number one hundred fifty at sign of cap of liberty must go with now can carry few pound of coffee better than mother said pierre in good faith told must never forget look on cousin face a turned round bade begone give mother message without word have evidently sent home promptly to obey cousin command morins message perplexed madame babette how must know be out of coffee said be only used last up morning how must victor know about be sure cant tell said pierre who by time have recovered usual self possession know be that monsieur be in pretty temper that if be not sharp to time at antoine meyers be likely to come in for of black look well be very kind of to offer to give coffee to be sure how must know be out pierre hurried mother off impatiently for be certain that offer of coffee be only blind to hidden purpose on cousin part made doubt that when mother have be informed of what cousin real intention be pierre must extract from by coaxing bullying be mistaken madame babette returned home grave depressed silent loaded with best coffee time afterwards learnt why cousin have sought for interview be to extract from by promise threat real name of mamselle cannes must give clue to true appellation of faithful cousin concealed second purpose from aunt who have be quite unaware of jealousy of norman farmer of identification of with relation of virginies madame babette instinctively shrank from giving information must have felt that in lowering mood in found desire for greater knowledge of virginies antecedent boded good yet made aunt confidantetold what have only suspected beforethat be deeply enamoured of mamselle cannes must gladly marry spoke to madame babette of father hoarded rich of share a partner have in at present time of prospect of succession to whole have a only child told aunt of provision for madame babettes life must make on day when married mamselle cannes yetand yetbabette saw that in eye look made more more reluctant to confide in by by tried threat must leave conciergerie find employment where liked still silence then grew angry swore that must inform against at bureau of directory for harbouring aristocrat aristocrat knew mademoiselle be real name might be aunt must have domiciliary visit see how liked that officer of government be people for finding out secret in vain reminded that by so doing must expose to imminent danger lady whom have professed to love told with sullen relapse into silence after vehement outpouring of passion never to trouble about at last wearied out old woman frightened alike of herself of told allthat mamselle cannes be mademoiselle virginie de crequy daughter of count of name who be count younger brother of marquis where be marquis dead long ago leaving widow child son eagerly yes son where be parbleu how must knowfor courage returned little a talk went away from only person of de crequy family that cared about by dint of small glass out of bottle of antoine meyers told more about de crequys than liked afterwards to remember for exhilaration of brandy lasted very short time came home a have said depressed with presentiment of coming evil must not answer pierre cuffed about in manner to spoilt boy be quite unaccustomed cousin short angry word sudden withdrawal of confidencehis mother unwonted crossness fault finding made virginies kind gentle treatment more than ever charming to lad half resolved to tell how have be acting a spy upon action at whose desire have done be afraid of morin of vengeance be sure must fall upon for breach of confidence towards half past eight that eveningpierre watching saw virginie arrange several little thingsshe be in inner room sat where must see through glazed partition mother satapparently sleepingin great easy chair virginie moved about softly for fear of disturbing made up one two little parcel of few thing must call own one packet concealed about herselfthe others directed left on shelf be going thought pierre a said in giving account heart gave spring to think that must never see again if mother cousin have be more kind to might have endeavoured to intercept a be held breath when came out pretended to read scarcely knowing whether wished to succeed in purpose be almost sure entertained not stopped by passed hand over hair told that eye filled with tear at caress then stood for moment looking at sleeping madame babette stooped down softly kissed on forehead pierre dreaded lest mother must awake for by time wayward vacillating boy must have be quite on virginies side brandy have drunk made slumber heavily virginie went pierre heart beat fast be sure cousin must try to intercept how must not imagine longed to run out see catastrophebut have let moment slip be also afraid of reawakening mother to unusual state of anger violence chapter viii pierre went on pretending to read in reality listening with acute tension of ear to little sound perception became so sensitive in respect that be incapable of measuring time moment have seemed so full of noise from beating of heart up to roll of heavy cart in distance wondered whether virginie must have reached place of rendezvous yet be unable to compute passage of minute mother slept soundly be well by time virginie must have met faithful cousin if indeed morin have not made appearance at length felt a if must no longer sit still awaiting issue must run out see what course event have taken in vain mother half rousing called after to ask whither be going be already out of hearing before have ended sentence ran on until stopped by sight of mademoiselle cannes walking along at so swift pace that be almost run while at side resolutely keeping by morin be striding abreast pierre have just turned corner of street when came upon virginie must have passed without recognizing be in such passionate agitation for morins gesture by must fain have kept pierre from interrupting then when virginie saw lad caught at arm thanked god a if in boy of twelve fourteen held protector pierre felt tremble from head to foot be afraid lest must fall there where stood in hard rough street begone pierre said morin can not replied pierre who indeed be held firmly by virginie besides wont added who have be frightening mademoiselle in way asked very much inclined to brave cousin at hazard mademoiselle be not accustomed to walk in street alone said morin sulkily came upon crowd attracted by arrest of aristocrat cry alarmed offered to take charge of home mademoiselle must not walk in street alone be not like cold blooded people of faubourg saint germain virginie did not speak pierre doubted if heard word of what be saying leant upon more more heavily will mademoiselle condescend to take arm said morin with sulky yet humble uncouthness dare say must have given world if might have have little hand within arm though still kept silence shuddered up away from a shrink from touching toad have said something to during walk may be sure have made loathe marked understood gesture held aloof while pierre gave assistance must in slow progress homewards morin accompanied same have played too desperate game to be baulked now have given information against ci devant marquis de crequy a returned emigre to be met with at time in place morin have hoped that sign of arrest must have be cleared away before virginie reached spotso swiftly be terrible deed done in day clement defended desperately virginie be punctual to second though wounded man be borne off to abbaye amid crowd of unsympathising jeerer who mingled with armed official of directory morin feared lest virginie have recognized must have preferred that must have thought that faithful cousin be faithless than that must have seen in bloody danger on account suppose fancied that if virginie never saw heard more of imagination must not dwell on simple disappearance a must do if knew what be suffering for sake at rate pierre saw that cousin be deeply mortified by whole tenor of behaviour during walk home when arrived at madame babettes virginie fell fainting on floor strength have just sufficed for exertion of reaching shelter of house first sign of restoring consciousness consisted in avoidance of morin have be most assiduous in effort to bring round quite tender in way pierre said marked instinctive repugnance to evidently gave extreme pain suppose frenchman be more demonstrative than be for pierre declared that saw cousin eye fill with tear a shrank away from touch if tried to arrange shawl have laid under head like pillow a shut eye when passed before madame babette be urgent with to go lie down on bed in inner room be time before be strong enough to rise do when madame babette returned from arranging girl comfortably three relation sat down in silence silence pierre thought must never be broken wanted mother to ask cousin what have happened madame babette be afraid of nephew thought more discreet to wait for such crumb of intelligence a might think fit to throw to after have twice reported virginie to be asleep without word being uttered in reply to whisper by of companion morins power of self containment gave way be hard said what be hard asked madame babette after have paused for time to enable to add to to finish sentence if pleased be hard for man to love woman a do went oni did not seek to love came upon before be awarebefore have ever thought about at loved better than world beside life before knew seems dull blank know care for what did before then now there be just two life before have have not be be everything what can do to make have tell aunt caught at madame babettes arm gave so sharp shake that half screamed out pierre said evidently grew alarmed at nephew

be two day absent so much better for suffers now for having come between objectin trying to snatch away out of sight take warning pierre did not like meddling to night so went off leaving madam babette rocking backwards forward in depression of spirit consequent upon reaction after brandy upon knowledge of nephew threatened purpose combined in telling most of have simply repeated pierre account wrote down at time here what have to say came to sudden break for next morning when madame babette rose virginie be missing be time before pierre morin must get slightest clue to missing girl now must take up story a be told to intendant flechier by old gardener jacques with whom clement have be lodging on first arrival in paris old man must not dare say remember half a much of what have happened a pierre did former have dulled memory of age while pierre have evidently thought over whole series of event a storyas play if one may call soduring solitary hour in after life wherever be passed whether in lonely camp watch in foreign prison where have to drag out many year clement have a said returned to gardener garret after have be dismissed from hotel duguesclin there be several reason for thus doubling back one be that put nearly whole breadth of paris between enemy though why morin be enemy to what extent carried dislike hatred clement must not tell of course next reason for returning to jacques be doubt conviction that in multiplying residence multiplied chance against being suspected recognized then again old man be in secret ally although perhaps feeble kind of one

medlicott can decide upon in way of strengthening dainty for poor young man who be killing with over sensitive conscientiousness oh lady said then stopped well what asked if must let have farmer hale barn at once must do more good than pooh pooh child though dont think be displeased be not fit for more work just now will go write for dr trevor for next half hour did nothing arrange physical comfort cure for poor mr gray at end of time mr medlicott said have ladyship heard harry gregson have fallen from tree broken thigh bone be like to be cripple for life harry gregson black eyed lad who read letter come from over education chapter xi dont see how lady must think be over education that made harry gregson break thigh for manner in met with accident be mr horner who have fallen sadly out of health since wife death have attached greatly to harry gregson now mr horner have cold manner to one never spoke more than be necessary at best of time latterly have not be best of time with dare say have have cause for anxiety of knew nothing about lady affair be evidently annoyed by lady whim a once inadvertently called of placing miss galindo under in position of clerk yet have always be friend in quiet way with miss galindo devoted to new occupation with diligence punctuality although more than once have moaned to over order for needlework have be sent to owing to occupation in service of lady ludlow have be unable to fulfil only living creature to whom staid mr horner must be said to be attached be harry gregson to lady be faithful devoted servant looking keenly after interest anxious to forward at cost of trouble to more shrewd mr horner be more probability be there of being annoyed at certain peculiarity of opinion lady held with quiet gentle pertinacity against argument based on mere worldly business calculation made way frequent opposition to view mr horner entertained although did not interfere with sincere respect lady steward felt for other yet prevented warmer feeling of affection from coming in seems strange to say must repeat itthe only person for whom since wife death mr horner seemed to feel love be little imp harry gregson with bright watchful eye tangled hair hanging right down to eyebrow for world like skye terrier lad half gipsy whole poacher a many people esteemed hung about silent respectable staid mr horner followed step with something of affectionate fidelity of dog resembled suspect demonstration of attachment to person on harry gregsons part be what won mr horners regard in first instance steward have only chosen lad out a cleverest instrument must find for purpose dont mean to say that if harry have not be almost a shrewd a mr horner be both by original disposition subsequent experience steward must have taken to a did let lad have shown ever so much affection for even to harry mr horner be silent still be pleasant to find in many way so readily understood to perceive that crumb of knowledge let fall be picked up by little follower hoarded like gold that here be one to hate person thing whom mr horner coldly disliked to reverence admire for whom have regard mr horner have never have child unconsciously suppose something of paternal feeling have begun to develop in towards harry gregson heard one two thing from different people have always made fancy that mr horner secretly almost unconsciously hoped that harry gregson might be trained so a to be first clerk next assistant finally successor in stewardship to hanbury estate harrys disgrace with lady in consequence of reading letter be deeper blow to mr horner than quiet manner must ever have led one to suppose than lady ludlow ever dreamed of inflicting be sure probably harry have short stern rebuke from mr horner at time for manner be always hard even to cared for most harrys love be not to be daunted quelled by few sharp word dare say from what heard of afterwards that harry accompanied mr horner in walk over farm very day of rebuke presence apparently unnoticed by agent by whom absence must have be painfully felt nevertheless be way of a have be told mr horner never bade harry go with never thanked for going being at heel ready to run on errand straight a crow fly to point back to heel in a short time a possible yet if harry be away mr horner never inquired reason from of men who might be supposed to know whether be detained by father otherwise engaged never asked harry where have be miss galindo said that labourer who knew mr horner well told that be always more quick eyed to shortcoming more savage like in fault finding on day when lad be absent miss galindo indeed be great authority for most of village news heard be who gave particular of poor harrys accident see dear said little poacher have taken unaccountable fancy to master be name by miss galindo always spoke of mr horner to ever since have be a called appointed clerk now if have twenty heart to lose never must spare bit of one of for good gray square severe man different people have different taste here be little imp of gipsy tinker ready to turn slave for master odd enough masterwho must have said beforehand must have made short work of imp imp family have sent bang beggar after in timemy master a tell be in way quite fond of lad if must without vexing lady too much must have made what folk here call latiner however last night seems that there be letter of importance forgotten cant tell what be about dear though know perfectly well service oblige a well a noblesse must take word for that be important one be surprised master must forget till too late for post poor good orderly man be not what be before wife death well seems that be sore annoyed by forgetfulness well might be be more vexatious a have one to blame a for matter always scold somebody else when im in fault suppose master must never think of doing else mighty relief however must eat tea be altogether put out gloomy little faithful imp lad perceiving suppose got up like page in old ballad said must run for life across country to comberford see if must not get there before bag be made up so master gave letter nothing more be heard of poor fellow till morning for father thought son be sleeping in mr horners barn a doe occasionally seems master a be very natural that have gone to father have fallen down old stone quarry have not yes sure enough mr gray have be up here fretting lady with of new fangled scheme because young man must not have own way from what understand be put out thought must go home by back lane instead of through village where folk must notice if parson looked glum however be mercy dont mind saying so ay meaning too though may be like methodism for a mr gray walked by quarry heard groan at first thought be lamb fallen down stood still then heard again then suppose looked down saw harry so let down by bough of tree to ledge where harry lay half dead with poor thigh broken there have lain ever since night before have be returning to tell master that have safely posted letter first word said when recovered from exhausted state be in be miss galindo tried hard not to whimper a said be in time sir seed put in bag with own eye where be asked how did mr gray get out ay there be see why old gentleman darent say devil in lady ludlows house be not so black a be painted mr gray must have deal of good in a say at time then at others when have gone against cant bear think hanging too good for lifted poor lad a if have be baby suppose carried up great ledge be formerly used for step laid soft easy on wayside grass ran home got help door have carried to house laid on bed then somehow for first time one else perceived be over bloodhis own bloodhe have broken blood vessel there lie in little dressing room a white a still a if be dead little imp in mr gray own bed sound asleep now leg be set just a if linen sheet feather bed be native element a one may say really now be doing so well ive patience with lying there where mr gray ought to be be just what lady always prophesied must come to pas if there be confusion of rank poor mr gray said thinking of flushed face feverish restless way when have be calling on lady not hour before exertion on harrys behalf told miss galindo how ill have thought yes said be reason lady have sent for doctor trevor well have fallen out admirably for looked well after old donkey of prince saw that made blunder now that old donkey of prince meant village surgeon mr prince between whom miss galindo there be war to knife a often met in cottage when there be illness have queer odd recipe with grand pharmacopoeia held in infinite contempt consequence of squabbling have be not long before very time that have established kind of rule that into sick room miss galindo be admitted there refused to visit miss galindos prescription visit cost nothing be often backed by kitchen physic so though be true that never came scolded about something other be generally preferred a medical attendant to mr prince yes old donkey be obliged to tolerate be civil to for see got there first have possession a be yet lord donkey like credit of attending parson being in consultation with so grand county town doctor a doctor trevor doctor trevor be old friend of mine sighed little time may tell why treat with infinite bowing respect so donkey not to be out of medical fashion bow too though be sadly against grain pulled face a if have heard slate pencil gritting against slate when told doctor trevor meant to sit up with two lad for call mr gray little more than lad pretty conceited one too at time why must sit up miss galindo will tire sadly not see there be gregsons mother to keep quiet for sits by lad fretting sobbing so that im afraid of disturbing mr gray there mr gray to keep quiet for doctor trevor say life depends on there be medicine to be given to one bandage to be attended to for other wild horde of gipsy brother sister to be turned out father to be held in from showing too much gratitude to mr gray who cant hear itand who be to do only servant be old lame betty who once lived with must leave because said be always botheringthere be good deal of truth in what said grant need not have said good deal of truth be best let alone at bottom of well what can dodeaf a ever can be too so miss galindo went way not le be at post in morning little crosser more silent than usual first be not to be wondered at last be rather blessing lady ludlow have be extremely anxious about mr gray harry gregson kind thoughtful in case of illness accident always be somehow in feeling that be not quitewhat will call itfriends seems hardly right word to use a to possible feeling between countess ludlow little vagabond messenger who have only once be in presencethat have hardly parted from a must have wished to do have death be near made more than usually anxious doctor trevor be not to spare obtaining best medical advice county must afford ordered in way of diet be to be prepared under mr medlicotts own eye sent down from hall to parsonage a mr horner have given somewhat similar direction in case of harry gregson at least there be rather multiplicity of counsellor dainty than lack of second night mr horner insisted on taking superintendence of nursing sat snored by harrys bedside while poor exhausted mother lay by childthinking that watched in reality fast asleep a miss galindo told for distrusting one power of watching nursing own have stolen across quiet village street in cloak dressing gown found mr gray in vain trying to reach cup of barley water mr horner have placed just beyond reach in consequence of mr gray illness have to have strange curate to do duty man who dropped h hurried through service yet have time enough to stand in lady way bowing to a came out of church so subservient in manner that believe that sooner than remain unnoticed by countess must have preferred being scolded even cuffed now found out that great a be lady liking approval of respect nay even reverence being paid to a person of qualitya sort of tribute to order have individual right to remit indeed not to exactyet being personally simple sincere holding in low esteem must not endure anything like servility of mr crosse temporary curate grew absolutely to loathe perpetual smiling bowing instant agreement with slightest opinion uttered veering round a blew wind have often said that lady did not talk much a might have done have lived among equal loved so much that have learnt to interpret little way pretty truly knew what particular turn of head contraction of delicate finger meant a well a if have expressed in word began to suspect that lady must be very thankful to have mr gray about again doing duty even with conscientiousness might amount to worrying fidgeting others although mr gray might hold opinion in a little esteem a of simple gentlewoman be too sensible not to feel how much flavour there be in conversation compared to of mr crosse who be only tasteless echo a for miss galindo be utterly entirely partisan of mr gray almost ever since have begun to nurse during illness know never set up for reasonableness lady so dont pretend to say a might do if be sensible woman thatthat be convinced by mr gray argument of thing tother for one thing see poor fellow have never be able to argue hardly indeed to speak for doctor trevor have be very peremptory so there be scope for arguing what mean be thiswhen see sick man thinking always of others never of patient humblea trifle too much at time for ive caught praying to be forgiven for having neglected work a parish priest miss galindo be making horrible face to keep back tear squeezing up eye in way must have amused at other time when be speaking of mr gray when see downright good religious man im apt to think he got hold of right clue that can do better than hold on by tail of coat shut eye if weve got to go over doubtful place on road to heaven so lady must excuse if when get about again be agog about sunday school for if be will be agog too perhaps twice a bad a for see ive strong constitution compared to strong way of speaking acting tell ladyship now because think from rankand still more if may say so for kindness to long ago down to very dayyouve right to be first told of anything about change of opinion cant exactly call for dont see good of school teaching b c more than did before only mr gray doe so im to shut eye leap over ditch to side of education ive told sally already that if doe not mind work stand gossiping with nelly mather ill teach lesson ive never caught with old nelly since think miss galindos desertion to mr gray opinion in matter hurt lady just little bit only said of course if parishoners wish for mr gray must have sunday school will in case withdraw opposition be sorry can not alter opinion a easily a lady made smile a said miss galindo saw be effort to do so thought minute before spoke again ladyship have not seen mr gray a intimately a have done thats one thing a for parishioner will follow ladyship lead in everything so there be chance of wishing for sunday school have never done anything to make follow lead a call miss galindo said lady gravely yes have replied miss galindo bluntly then correcting said begging ladyship pardon have ancestor have lived here time out of mind have owned land on forefather have lived ever since there be forefather be born amongst have be like little queen to ever since might say theyve never known ladyship do anything what be kind gentle ill leave fine speech about ladyship to mr crosse only lady lead thought of parish save of world of trouble for must never tell what be right if have to think for quite right that must be guided by ladyif only must agree with mr gray well said lady told only last day that be here that must think about do believe must make up mind on certain subject better if be left alone than while being constantly talked to about lady said in usual soft tone word have tinge of impatience about indeed be more ruffled than have often seen checking in instant said dont know how mr horner drag in subject of education apropos of everything not that say much about at time be not way can not let thing alone know why lady said miss galindo poor lad harry gregson will never be able to earn livelihood in active way will be lame for life now mr horner think more of harry than of one else in worldexcept perhaps ladyship be not pretty companionship for lady have scheme of own for teaching harry if mr gray must have school mr horner think harry might be schoolmaster a ladyship must not like to have coming to a steward clerk wish ladyship must fall into plan mr gray have so at heart miss galindo looked wistfully at lady a said lady only said drily rising at same time a if to end conversation so mr horner mr gray seem to have gone long way in advance of consent to plan there exclaimed miss galindo a lady left room with apology for going away have gone done mischief with long stupid tongue to be sure people plan long way ahead of to day more especially when one be sick man lying through weary day on sofa lady will soon get over annoyance said a be apologetically only stopped miss galindos self reproach to draw down wrath upon have not right to be annoyed with if like to keep annoyed a long a like be complaining of that need tell that let tell have known lady thirty year if be to take by shoulder turn out of house must only love more so dont think to come between with little mincing peace making speech have be mischief making parrot like better for being vexed with so good bye to miss wait till know lady ludlow a well a do before next think of telling will soon get over annoyance off miss galindo went must not exactly tell what have done wrong took care never again to come in between lady by remark about one to other for saw that most powerful bond of grateful affection made miss galindo almost worship lady meanwhile harry gregson be limping little about in village still finding home in mr gray house for there must most conveniently be kept under doctor eye receive requisite care enjoy requisite nourishment a soon a be little better be to go to mr horners house a steward lived distance out of way be much from home have agreed to leave harry at house to have first be taken until be quite strong again more willingly suspect from what heard afterwards because mr gray gave up little strength of speaking have to teaching harry in very manner mr horner most desired a for gregson fatherhewild man of wood tinker jack of tradeswas getting tamed by kindness to child hitherto hand have be against man a man have be against affair before justice told about when mr gray even lady have interested to get released from unjust imprisonment be first bit of justice have ever met with attracted to people attached to spot on have squatted for time be not sure if of villager be grateful to for remaining in neighbourhood instead of decamping a have often done before for good reason doubtless of personal safety harry be only one out of brood of ten twelve child of whom have earned for good character in service one indeed have be actually transported for robbery committed in distant part of county tale be yet told in village of how gregson father came back from trial in state of wild rage striding through place uttering oath of vengeance to great black eye gleaming out of matted hair arm working by side now then tossed up in impotent despair a heard account wife followed child laden weeping after have vanished from country for time leaving mud hovel locked up door key a neighbour said buried in hedge bank gregsons have reappeared much about same time that mr gray came to hanbury have never heard of evil character considered that gave more claim upon christian care end of be that rough untamed strong giant of heathen be loyal slave to weak hectic nervous self distrustful parson gregson have also kind of grumbling respect for mr horner did not quite like steward monopoly of harry mother submitted to that with better grace swallowing down maternal jealousy in prospect of child advancement to better more respectable position than in parent have struggled through life mr horner steward gregson poacher squatter have come into disagreeable contact too often in former day for to be perfectly cordial at future time even now when there be immediate cause for anything gratitude for child sake on gregsons part must skulk out of mr horners way if saw coming took mr horners natural reserve acquired restraint to keep from occasionally holding up father life a warning to harry now gregson have nothing of desire for avoidance with regard to mr gray poacher have feeling of physical protection towards parson while latter have shown moral courage without gregson must never have respected in coming right down upon more than once in exercise of unlawful pursuit simply boldly telling be doing wrong with quiet reliance upon gregsons better feeling at same time that strong poacher must not have lifted finger against mr gray though have be to save from being apprehended taken to lock ups very next hour have rather listened to parson bold word with approving smile much a mr gulliver might have hearkened to lecture from lilliputian when brave word passed into kind deed gregsons heart mutely acknowledged master keeper beauty of be that mr gray knew nothing of good work have done recognized a instrument god have employed thanked god be true fervently often that work be done loved wild man for rough gratitude never occurred to poor young clergyman lying on sick bed praying a miss galindo have told did to be forgiven for unprofitable life to think of gregsons reclaimed soul a anything with have have to do be now more than three month since mr gray have be at hanbury court during time have be confined to house if not to sick bed

where sat such day for to go out exclaimed looking at fog have crept up to window be sapping little remaining life in brilliant virginian creeper leaf that draperied house on terrace side came in white trembling large eye wild dilated hastened up to lady ludlows chair to surprise took one of hand kissed without speaking yet shaking over mr gray said quickly with sharp tremulous apprehension of unknown evil what be there be something unusual about something unusual have occurred replied forcing word to be calm a with great effort gentleman came to house not hour agoa mr howard came straight from vienna son said dear lady stretching out arm in dumb questioning attitude lord gave lord taketh away blessed be name of lord poor lady must not echo word be last remaining child once have be joyful mother of nine chapter xii be ashamed to say what feeling became strongest in mind about time next to sympathy of felt for dear lady in deep sorrow mean for be greater stronger than anything

seeing that must be heiress of hanbury property have given training be thought unusual in day liked to feel queen regnant to have to decide in case between herself tenantry perhaps mr horner must have

good feeling to put blame into word lady quick instinct led to reply to thought existence of perceived quietly told truth explained how have interfered repeatedly to prevent mr horner from taking certain desirable step be discordant to hereditary sense of right wrong between landlord tenant also spoke of want of ready money a misfortune must be remedied by more economical personal expenditure on own part by individual saving be possible that reduction of fifty pound year might have be accomplished a soon a mr smithson touched on larger economy such a affected welfare of others honour standing of great house of hanbury be inflexible establishment consisted of somewhere about forty servant of whom nearly a many a twenty be unable to perform work properly yet must have be hurt if

instant lady saw bade john footman place stool for to sit down upon while spoke to might be paleness gave whole face more refined gentle look suspect be that boy be apt to take impression mr horners grave dignified way mr gray tender quiet manner have altered then thought of illness death seem to turn many of into gentleman gentlewoman a long a such thought be in mind can not speak loudly angrily at such time be not apt to be eager about mere worldly thing for very awe at quickened sense of nearness of invisible world make calm serene about petty trifle of to day at least know be explanation mr gray once gave of what thought great improvement in harry gregsons way of behaving lady hesitated so long about what have best say that harry grew little frightened at silence few month ago must have surprised more than did now since lord son death have seemed altered in many waysmore uncertain distrustful of a be at last said think tear be in eye poor little fellow have have narrow escape

have with exception of legacy to old clerk morrison knew that estateon forefather have lived for six hundred yearswas in debt have immediate chance of paying off debt yet felt that be very sad thing for old property like to belong in part to other men who have lent money understand think little man said questioning harrys face have left off cry be trying to understand with might main think have got pretty good general idea of state of affair though probably be puzzled by term estate being in debt be sufficiently interested to want lady to go on nodded head at to signify to so mr horner took money once meant to be yours have left greater part of to with intention of helping to pay off debt have told about will go long way will try hard to save rest then will die happy in leaving land free from debt paused will not die happy in thinking of know if having money even having great estate much honour be good thing for of god see fit that of must be called to condition be duty then to stand by post like brave soldier now mr horner intended to have money first will only call borrowing from harry gregson if take use to pay off debt will pay mr gray interest on money because be to stand a guardian a be till come of age must fix what ought to be done with so a to fit for spending principal rightly when estate can repay suppose now will be right for to be educated will be snare will come

like to take so bold step a bringing home knowing what effect of consequent explanation must be on lady a girl be now more than seventeen past age when young lady be usually kept at school a there be great demand for governess in day a bessy have never be taught trade by to earn own living why dont exactly see what must have be done for miss galindo to bring to own home in hanbury for although child have grown up lately in kind of unexpected manner into young woman miss galindo might have kept at school for year longer if must have afforded be impossible when became mr horners clerk relinquished payment of repository work perhaps after be not sorry to be compelled to take step be longing for at rate bessy came to live with miss galindo in very few week from time when captain james set miss galindo free to superintend own domestic economy again for long time knew nothing about new inhabitant of hanbury lady never mentioned in way be in accordance with lady ludlows well known principle saw heard be in way cognisant of existence of who have legal right to exist at if miss galindo have hoped to have exception made in bessys favour be mistaken lady sent note inviting miss galindo to tea one evening about month after bessy came miss galindo have cold must not come next time be invited have engagement at homea step nearer to absolute truth third time have young friend staying with whom be unable to leave lady accepted excuse a bona fide took further notice missed miss galindo very much did for in day when be clerk be sure to come in find opportunity of saying something amusing to of before went away a invalid perhaps from natural tendency be particularly fond of little bit of village gossip there be mr hornerhe even have come in now then with formal stately piece of intelligenceand there be miss galindo in day missed much so did lady be sure behind quiet sedate manner be certain heart ached sometimes for few word from miss galindo who seemed to have absented altogether from hall now bessy be come captain james might be very sensible not even lady must call substitute for old familiar friend be thorough sailor a sailor be in daysswore good deal drank good deal without ever affecting in least be very prompt kind hearted in action be not accustomed to woman a lady once said must judge in thing for lady have expected think to find one who must take notion on management of estate from ladyship own self spoke a if be responsible for good management of whole must consequently be allowed full liberty of action have be too long in command over men at sea to like to be directed by woman in anything undertook even though woman be lady suppose be common sense lady spoke of when common sense go against dont think value quite so much a ought to do lady ludlow be proud of personal superintendence of own estate liked to tell how father used to take with in ride bid observe on account to allow such such thing to be done have heard that first time told to captain james told point blank that have heard from mr smithson that farm be much neglected rent sadly behindhand that meant to set to in good earnest study agriculture see how must remedy state of thing lady must be sure be greatly surprised what must do here be very man have chosen setting to with energy to conquer defect of ignorance be that who have presumed to offer ladyship advice have ever have to say against captain james read arthur young tour in spare time a long a be invalid shook head at lady account a to how land have be cropped left fallow from time immemorial then set to tried too many new experiment at once lady looked on in dignified silence farmer tenant be in uproar prophesied hundred failure perhaps fifty did occur be only half a many a lady ludlow have feared be twice a many four eight time a many a captain have anticipated openly expressed disappointment made popular again rough country people must not have understood silent dignified regret at failure of plan sympathized with man who swore at ill successsympathized even while chuckled over discomfiture mr brooke retired tradesman did not cease blaming for not succeeding for swearing what must expect from sailor mr brooke asked even in lady hearing though might have known captain james be lady own personal choice from old friendship mr urian have always shown for think be speech of birmingham baker made lady determine to stand by captain james encourage to try again for must not allow that choice have be unwise one at bidding a be of dissenting tradesman only person in neighbourhood too who have flaunted about in coloured clothes when world be in mourning for lady only son captain james must have thrown agency up at once if lady have not felt bound to justify wisdom of choice by urging to stay be much touched by confidence in swore great oath that next year must make land such a have never be before for produce be not lady way to repeat anything have heard especially to person disadvantage so dont think ever told captain james of mr brooke speech about sailor being likely to mismanage property captain be too anxious to succeed in second year of trial to be above going to flourishing shrewd mr brooke asking for advice a to best method of working estate dare say if miss galindo have be a intimate a formerly at hall must of have heard of new acquaintance of agent long before did a be be sure lady never dreamed that captain who held opinion be even more church king than own must ever have made friend with baptist baker from birmingham even to serve ladyship own interest in most loyal manner heard of first from mr gray who came now often to see lady for must forget solemn tie fact of being person to acquaint with lord death have created between for true holy word spoken at time though having reference to aught below solemn subject of life death have made withdraw opposition to mr gray wish about establishing village school have sighed little be true be even yet more apprehensive than hopeful a to result almost a if a memorial to lord have allowed kind of rough school house to be built on green just by church have gently used power undoubtedly have in expressing strong wish that boy might only be taught to read write first four rule of arithmetic while girl be only to learn to read to add up in head rest of time to work at mending own clothes knitting stocking spinning lady presented school with more spinning wheel than there be girl requested that there might be rule that must have spun so many hank of flax knitted so many pair of stocking before ever be taught to read at after be making best of bad job with poor ladybut life be not what have be to remember well day that mr gray pulled delicately fine yarn be good judge of thing out of pocket laid capital pair of knitted stocking before lady a first fruit so to say of school recollect seeing put on spectacle carefully examine production then passed to be well mr gray be much pleased be fortunate in schoolmistress have have proper knowledge of womanly thing much patience who be one out of village lady said mr gray stammering colouring in old fashion miss bessy be so very kind a to teach sort of thingsmiss bessy miss galindo sometimes lady looked at over spectacle only repeated word miss bessy paused a if trying to remember who person must be if have then intended to say more be quelled by manner dropped subject went on to say that have thought duty to decline subscription to school offered by mr brooke because be dissenter that mr gray feared that captain james through whom mr brooke offer of money have be made be offended at refusing to accept from man who held heterodox opinion nay whom mr gray suspected of being infected by dodwells heresy think there must be mistake said lady have misunderstood captain james must never be sufficiently with schismatic to be employed by man brooke in distributing charity must have doubted until now if captain james knew indeed lady not only know be intimate with regret to say have repeatedly seen captain mr brooke walking together going through field together people do say lady looked up in interrogation at mr gray pause disapprove of gossip may be untrue people do say that captain james be very attentive to miss brooke impossible said lady indignantly captain james be loyal religious man beg pardon mr gray be impossible chapter xiv like many other thing have be declared to be impossible report of captain james being attentive to miss brooke turned out to be very true mere idea of agent being on slightest possible term of acquaintance with dissenter tradesman birmingham democrat who have come to settle in good orthodox aristocratic agricultural hanbury made lady very uneasy miss galindos misdemeanour in having taken miss bessy to live with faded into mistake mere error of judgment in comparison with captain james intimacy at yeast house a brooke called ugly square built farm lady talked quite into complacency with miss galindo even miss bessy be named by first time have ever be aware that lady recognized existence buti recollect be long rainy afternoon sat with ladyship have time opportunity for long uninterrupted talkwhenever have be silent for little while began again with something like wonder how be that captain james must ever have commenced acquaintance with man brooke lady recapitulated time must remember that anything have occurred be said by captain james must now understand a throwing light upon subject said once that be anxious to bring in norfolk system of cropping spoke good deal about mr coke of holkham who by way be more coke than amcollateral in female linewhich count for little nothing among great old commoner family of pure blood new way of cultivation of course new men bring in new way doe not follow that be better than old way however captain james have be very anxious to try turnip bone manure really be man of such good sense energy be so sorry last year about failure consented now begin to see error have always heard that town baker adulterate flour with bone dust of course captain james must be aware of go to brooke to inquire where article be to be purchased lady always ignored fact have sometimes suspect be brought under very eye during drive that mr brooke few field be in state of far higher cultivation than own so must not of course perceive that there be wisdom to be gained from asking advice of tradesman turned farmer by by fact of agent intimacy with person whom in whole world most disliked with sort of dislike in large amount of uncomfortableness be combinedthe dislike conscientious people sometimes feel to without knowing why yet can not indulge in with comfort to without having moral reason why came before lady in many shape for indeed be sure that captain james be not man to conceal be ashamed of one of action can not fancy ever lowering strong loud clear voice having confidental conversation with one when crop have failed village have known complained regretted be angry owned fool down village street consequence be that although be far more passionate man than mr horner tenant liked far better people in general take kindlier interest in one working of whose mind heart can watch understand than in man who only let know what have be thinking about feeling by what doe harry gregson be faithful to memory of mr horner miss galindo have told that used to watch hobble out of way of captain james a if to accept notice however good naturedly given must have be kind of treachery to former benefactor gregson father new agent rather took to other one day much to surprise heard that poaching tinkering vagabond a people used to call gregson when first have come to live at hanbury have be appointed gamekeeper mr gray standing godfather a be to trustworthiness if be trusted with anything thought at time be rather experiment only answered a many of mr gray deed of daring did be curious how be growing to be kind of autocrat in village how unconscious be of be a shy awkward nervous a ever in affair be not of moral consequence to a soon a be convinced that thing be right shut eye ran butted at like ram a captain james once expressed in talking over something mr gray have done people in village said never knew what parson must be at next might have said where reverence must next turn up for have heard of marching right into middle of set of poacher gathered together for desperate midnight enterprise walking into public house that lay just beyond bound of lady estate in extra parochial piece of ground named long ago be considered rendezvous of neer do weel character for mile round where parson constable be held in much same kind of esteem a unwelcome visitor yet mr gray have long fit of depression in felt a if be doing nothing making way in work useless unprofitable better out of world than in in comparison with work have set to do what did seemed to be nothing suppose be constitutional attack of lowness of spirit have about time perhaps part of nervousness made always so awkward when came to hall even mr medlicott who almost worshipped ground trod on a saying be owned that mr gray never entered one of lady room without knocking down something too often breaking must much sooner have faced desperate poacher than young lady day at least so thought know how be that came to pas that lady became reconciled to miss galindo about time whether be that ladyship be weary of unspoken coolness with old friend that specimen of delicate sewing fine spinning at school have mollified towards miss bessy be surprised to learn one day miss galindo young friend be coming very evening to tea at hall information be given by mr medlicott a message from lady who further went on to desire certain little preparation must be made in own private sitting room in greater part of day be spent from nature of preparation became quite aware that lady intended to do honour to expected visitor indeed lady ludlow never forgave by half a have known people do be coming a visitor to lady peeress poor nameless girl there be certain amount of preparation required in order to do fitting honour mean to say that preparation be of same degree of importance in case dare say if peeress have come to visit at hall cover must have be taken off furniture in white drawing room never be uncovered time stayed at hall because lady must wish to offer ornament luxury grand visitor who never camei wish have did so want to see furniture uncovered be accustomed to at home to present to in best order in lady must same rule mollified held good with miss galindo certain thing in lady knew took interest be laid out ready for to examine on very day what be more great book of print be laid out such a remembered lady have have brought forth to beguile own early day of illnessmr hogarth work likewhich be sure be put out for miss bessy one know how curious be to see mysterious miss bessytwenty time more mysterious of course for want of surname then again to try account for great curiosity of in recollection be more than half ashamed have be leading quiet monotonous life of crippled invalid for many yearsshut up from sight of new face be to be face of one whom have thought about so much so longoh think might be excused of course drank tea in great hall with four young gentlewoman who with formed small bevy now under ladyship charge of who be at hanbury when first came none remained be married gone once more to live at home must be called own whether ostensible head be father brother be not without hope of similar kind brother harry be now curate in westmoreland wanted to go live with a eventually did for time be neither here there at present what be talking about be miss bessy after reasonable time have elapsed occupied a well knew by meal in great hallthe measured yet agreeable conversation afterwardsand certain promenade around hall through drawing room with pause before different picture history subject of of be invariably told by lady to new visitora sort of giving freedom of old family seat by describing kind nature of great progenitor who have lived there before narratori heard step approaching lady room where lay think be in such state of nervous expectation that if must have moved easily must have got up run away yet need not have be for miss galindo be not in least altered nose little redder to be sure then might only have have temporary cause in private cry know must have have before coming to see dear lady ludlow once again must almost have pushed miss galindo away a intercepted in view of mysterious miss bessy miss bessy be a knew only about eighteen looked older dark hair dark eye tall firm figure good sensible face with serene expression not in least disturbed by what have be thinking must be such awful circumstance a first introduction to lady who have so disapproved of very existence be clearest impression remember of first interview with miss bessy seemed to observe in quiet manner quite a much a did spoke very little occupied indeed a lady have planned with looking over great book of engraving think must have foolishly intended to make feel at ease by patronage be seated far away from sofa in order to command light really seemed so unconcerned at unwonted circumstance that did not need countenance kindness one thing did likeher watchful look at miss galindo from time to time showed that thought sympathy be ever at miss galindos service a indeed well might be when miss bessy spoke voice be full clear what said to purpose though there be slight provincial accent in way of speaking after while lady set two to play at chess game have lately learnt at mr gray suggestion still did not talk much together though be becoming attracted towards other fancy will play well said have only learnt about six month have yet can nearly beat who have be at a many year began to learn last november remember mr gray bringing philidor on chess one very foggy dismal day what made look up so suddenly with bright inquiry in eye what made silent for moment a if in thought then go on with something know not what in quite altered tone lady miss galindo went on talking while sat thinking heard captain james name mentioned pretty frequently at last lady put down work said almost with tear in eye must noti can not believe must be aware be schismatic baker daughter be gentleman by virtue feeling a well a by profession though manner may be at time little rough dear miss galindo what will world come to miss galindo might possibly be aware of own share in bringing world to pas now dismayed ladyfor of course though be now over forgiven yet miss bessys being received into respectable maiden lady house be one of portent a to world future alarmed ladyship miss galindo knew thisbut at rate have too lately be forgiven not to plead for mercy for next offender against lady delicate sense of fitness proprietyso replied indeed lady have long left off trying to conjecture what make jack fancy gill gill jack best to sit down quiet under belief that marriage be

lady after moment pause for consideration although be baker might have be churchman even eloquence miss galindo shant convince that be not own fault dont see even that begging pardon lady said miss galindo emboldened by first success of eloquence when baptist be baby if understand creed aright be not baptized consequently can have godfather godmother to do anything for in baptism agree to lady

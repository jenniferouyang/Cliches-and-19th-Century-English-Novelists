eating seed cake slowly considerately a did everything be rather surprised for knew have told on occasion of last party that never have in house reminded so much of scented soap always gave savoy biscuit however mr jamieson be kindly indulgent to miss barker want of knowledge of custom of high life to spare feeling ate three large piece of seed cake with placid ruminating expression of

very comfortable arm chair have be too much for mr jamieson be nodding once twice opened eye with effort calmly unconsciously smiled upon by by even benevolence be not equal to exertion be sound asleep be very gratifying to whispered miss barker at card table to three opponent whom notwithstanding ignorance of game be basting most unmercifullyvery gratifying indeed to see how completely mr jamieson feel at home in poor little dwelling must not have paid greater compliment miss barker provided with literature in shape of three four handsomely bound fashion book ten twelve year old observing a put little table candle for especial benefit that knew young people liked to look at picture carlo lay snorted started at mistress foot too be quite at home illustration hush lady if

cupid be in great favour with cranford lady although too expensive to be given except on solemn state occasionsmacaroons sopped in brandy must have called if have not known more refined classical name in short be evidently to be feasted with be sweetest best thought better to submit graciously even at cost of gentilitywhich never ate supper in general like most non supper eater be particularly hungry on special occasion miss barker in former sphere have daresay be made acquainted with beverage call cherry brandy none of have ever seen thing rather shrank back when proffered usjust little leetle glass lady after oyster lobster know shell fish be sometimes thought not very wholesome shook head like female mandarin at last mr jamieson suffered to be persuaded followed lead be not exactly unpalatable though so hot so strong that thought bound to give evidence that be not accustomed to such thing by coughing terriblyalmost a strangely a miss barker have done before be admitted by peggy very strong said miss pole a put down empty glass do believe there spirit in only little dropjust necessary to make keep said miss barker know put brandy paper over preserve to make keep often feel tipsy from eating damson tart question whether damson tart must have opened mr jamiesons heart a cherry brandy did told of coming event respecting have be quite silent till moment sister in law lady glenmire be coming to stay with there be chorus of indeed then pause one rapidly reviewed wardrobe a to fitness to appear in presence of baron widow for of course series of small festival be always held in cranford on arrival of visitor at of friend house felt very pleasantly excited on present occasion not long after maid lantern be announced mr jamieson have sedan chair have squeezed into miss barker narrow lobby with difficulty most literally stopped way required skilful manuvring on part of old chairman shoemaker by day when summoned to carry sedan dressed up in strange old liverylong greatcoat with small cape coeval with sedan similar to dress of class in hogarth picture to edge back try at again finally to succeed in carrying burden out of miss barker front door then heard quick pit pat along quiet little street a put on calash pinned up gown miss barker hovering about with offer of help if have not remembered former occupation wished to forget must have be much more pressing illustration pit pat illustration chapter ladyship early next morningdirectly after twelvemiss pole made appearance at miss mattys very trifling piece of business be alleged a reason for call there be evidently something behind at last out came by way youll think im strangely ignorant do really know be puzzled how ought to address lady glenmire do say ladyship where must say to common person have be puzzling morning be to say lady instead of maam now knew lady arleywill kindly tell most correct way of speaking to peerage poor miss matty took off spectacle put on againbut how lady arley be addressed must not remember be so long ago said dear dear how stupid be dont think ever saw more than twice know used to call sir peter sir peterbut came much oftener to see than lady arley did deborah must have known in minute ladyyour ladyship sound very strange a if be not natural never thought of before now have named be in puzzle be very certain miss pole must obtain wise decision from miss matty who got more bewildered moment more perplexed a to etiquette of address well really think said miss pole have better just go tell mr forrester about little difficulty one sometimes grows nervous yet one must not have lady glenmire think be quite ignorant of etiquette of high life in cranford will just step in here dear miss pole a come back please tell what decide upon mr forrester fix upon will be quite right im sure lady arley sir peter said miss matty to herself trying to recall old form of word who be lady glenmire asked oh shes widow of mr jamiesonthats mr jamiesons late husband knowwidow of eldest brother mr jamieson be miss walker daughter of governor walker ladyship dear if fix on way of speaking must just let practise little on first for will feel so foolish hot saying first time to lady glenmire be really relief to miss matty when mr jamieson came on very unpolite errand notice apathetic people have more quiet impertinence than others mr jamieson came now to insinuate pretty plainly that did not particularly wish that cranford lady must call upon sister in law can hardly say how made clear for grew very indignant warm while with slow deliberation be explaining wish to miss matty who true lady must hardly understand feeling made mr jamieson wish to appear to noble sister in law a if only visited county family miss matty remained puzzled perplexed long after have found out object of mr jamiesons visit when did understand drift of honourable lady call be pretty to see with what quiet dignity received intimation thus uncourteously given be not in least hurtshe be of too gentle spirit for be exactly conscious of disapproving of mr jamiesons conduct there be something of feeling in mind be sure made pas from subject to others in le flurried more composed manner than usual mr jamieson be indeed more flurried of two must see be glad to take leave little while afterwards miss pole returned red indignant well to be sure youve have mr jamieson here find from martha be not to call on lady glenmire yes met mr jamieson way between here mr forresters told took so by surprise have nothing to say wish have thought of something very sharp sarcastic daresay will to night lady glenmire be widow of scotch baron after went on to look at mr forresters peerage to see who lady be be to be kept under glass case widow of scotch peernever sat in house of lordsand a poor a job daresay shefifth daughter of mr campbell other be daughter of rector at rate related to arleys sir peter might have be viscount arley one say miss matty tried to soothe miss pole in vain that lady usually so kind good humoured be now in full flow of anger went ordered cap morning to be quite ready said at last letting out secret gave sting to mr jamiesons intimation mr jamieson will see if be so easy to get to make fourth at pool when have none of fine scotch relation with in coming out of church first sunday on lady glenmire appeared in cranford sedulously talked together turned back on mr jamieson guest if might not call on must not even look at though be dying with curiosity to know what be like have comfort of questioning martha in afternoon martha did not belong to sphere of society whose observation must be implied compliment to lady glenmire martha have made good use of eye well maam be little lady with mr jamieson mean thought must like more to know how young mr smith be dressed being bride mr smith be butcher wife miss pole said good gracious a if cared about mr smith be silent a martha resumed speech illustration sedulously talked together little lady in mr jamiesons pew have on maam rather old black silk shepherd plaid cloak maam very bright black eye have maam pleasant sharp face not over young maam yet must guess younger than mr jamieson looked up down church like bird nipped up petticoat when came out a quick sharp a ever see ill tell what maam shes more like mr deacon at coach horse one hush martha said miss matty thats not respectful isnt maam beg pardon im sure jem hearn said so a well said be just such sharp stirring sort of body lady said miss pole ladyas mr deacon sunday passed away still averted eye from mr jamieson guest made remark to ourselves that thought be very severealmost too much so miss matty be evidently uneasy at sarcastic manner of speaking perhaps by time lady glenmire have found out that mr jamiesons be not gayest liveliest house in world perhaps mr jamieson have found out that most of county family be in london that who remained in country be not so alive a might have be to circumstance of lady glenmire being in neighbourhood great event spring out of small cause so will not pretend to say what induced mr jamieson to alter determination of excluding cranford lady send note of invitation round for small party on following tuesday mr mulliner brought round must always ignore fact of there being back door to house gave louder rat tat than mistress mr jamieson have three little note carried in large basket in order to impress mistress with idea of great weight though might easily have gone into waistcoat pocket illustration mr mulliner miss matty quietly decided must have previous engagement at home be evening on miss matty usually made candle lighter of note letter of week for on monday account be always made straightnot penny owing from week before so by natural arrangement making candle lighter fell upon tuesday evening gave legitimate excuse for declining mr jamiesons invitation before answer be written in came miss pole with open note in hand so said ah see have got note too better late than never must have told lady glenmire must be glad enough of society before fortnight be over yes said miss matty be asked for tuesday evening perhaps must just kindly bring work across drink tea with night be usual regular time for looking over last week bill note letter making candle lighter of that doe not seem quite reason enough for saying have previous engagement at home though meant to make do now if must come conscience must be quite at ease luckily note be not written yet saw miss pole countenance change while miss matty be speaking dont mean to go then asked oh said miss matty quietly dont either suppose dont know replied miss pole yes think do said rather briskly on seeing miss matty looked surprised added see one must not like mr jamieson to think that anything must do say be of consequence enough to give offence must be kind of letting down of ourselves for one must not like must be too flattering to mr jamieson if allowed to suppose that what have said affected week nay ten day afterwards well suppose be wrong to be hurt annoyed so long about anything perhaps after did not mean to vex must say must not have brought to say thing mr jamieson did about not calling really dont think will go oh come miss matty must go know friend mr jamieson be much more phlegmatic than most people doe not enter into little delicacy of feeling posse in so remarkable degree thought possessed too day mr jamieson called to tell not to go said miss matty innocently miss pole in addition to delicacy of feeling possessed very smart cap be anxious to show to admiring world so seemed to forget angry word uttered not fortnight before to be ready to act on what called great christian principle of forgive forget lectured dear miss matty so long on head that absolutely ended by assuring be duty a deceased rector daughter to buy new cap go to party at mr jamiesons so be most happy to accept instead of regretting that be obliged to decline

at last so left off speaking proceeded to action now be astonished how did trick must not imagine not even when miss pole pulled out piece of paper began reading aloudor at least in very audible whisperthe separate receipt for most common of trick if ever saw man frown look enraged saw grand turk frown at miss pole a said what must be expected unchristian look from mussulman if miss pole be

be cranford people respected too much be too grateful to aristocracy who be so kind a to live near town ever to disgrace bringing up by being dishonest immoral therefore must believe that robber be strangersif stranger why not foreignersif foreigner who so likely a french signor brunoni spoke broken english like frenchman though wore turban like turk mr forrester have seen print of madame de

with footstool might have triumphed over miss pole who have professed such bravery until be frightened be too glad to perceive that shared in weakness of humanity to exult over gave up room to very willingly shared miss mattys bed for night before retired two lady rummaged up out of recess of memory such horrid story of robbery murder that quite quaked in shoe miss pole be evidently anxious to prove such terrible event have occurred within experience that be justified in sudden panic miss matty did not like to be outdone capped story with one yet more horrible till reminded oddly enough of old story have read somewhere of nightingale musician who strove one against other must produce most admirable music till poor philomel dropped down dead one of story haunted for long time afterwards be of girl who be left in charge of great house in cumberland on particular fair day when other servant went off to gaiety family be away in london pedlar came by asked to leave large heavy pack in kitchen saying must call for again at night girl gamekeeper daughter roaming about in search of amusement chanced to hit upon gun hanging up in hall took down to look at chasing went off through open kitchen door hit pack slow dark thread of blood came oozing out how miss pole enjoyed part of story dwelling on word a if loved rather hurried over further account of girl bravery have confused idea that somehow baffled robber with italian iron heated red hot then restored to blackness by being dipped in grease parted for night with awe stricken wonder a to what must hear of in morningand on part with vehement desire for night to be over gone be so afraid lest robber must have seen from dark lurking place miss pole have carried off plate thus have double motive for attacking house until lady glenmire came to call next day heard of nothing unusual kitchen fire iron be in exactly same position against back door a when martha have skilfully piled up like spillikin ready to fall with awful clatter if only cat have touched outside panel have wondered what must do if thus awakened alarmed have proposed to miss matty that must cover up face under bed clothes so that there must be danger of robber thinking that must identify miss matty who be trembling very much scouted idea said owed to society to apprehend that must certainly do best to lay hold of lock up in garret till morning

enough for way in have baffled on night in question to poison whether a among more uneducated people thought died of apoplexy brought on by too much feeding too little exercise at rate be certain that two day after eventful night carlo be found dead with poor little leg stretched out stiff in attitude of running a if by such unusual exertion must escape sure pursuer death be sorry for carlo old familiar friend who have snapped at for so many year mysterious mode of death made very uncomfortable must signor brunoni be at bottom of have apparently killed canary with only word of command will

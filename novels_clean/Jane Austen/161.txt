of such nature at time promised to do thing in power to make comfortable father be rendered easy by such assurance mr john dashwood have then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in power to do for be not ill disposed young man unless to be rather cold hearted rather selfish be to be ill disposed be in general well respected for conducted with propriety in discharge of ordinary duty have married more amiable woman might have be made still more respectable than washe might even have be made amiable for be very young when married very fond of wife mr john dashwood be strong caricature of himselfmore narrow minded selfish when gave promise to father meditated within to increase fortune of sister by present of thousand pound piece then really thought equal to prospect of four thousand year in addition to present income besides remaining half of own mother fortune warmed heart made feel capable of generosity yes must give three thousand pound must be liberal handsome must be enough to make completely easy three thousand pound must spare so considerable sum with little inconvenience thought of day long for many day successively did not repent sooner be father funeral over than mr john dashwood without sending notice of intention to mother in law arrived with child attendant one must dispute right to come house be husband from moment of father decease indelicacy of conduct be so much greater to woman in mr dashwoods situation with only common feeling must have be highly unpleasingbut in mind there be sense of honor so keen generosity so romantic that offence of kind by whomsoever given received be to source of immovable disgust mr john dashwood have never be favourite with of husband family have have opportunity till present of showing with how little attention to comfort of other people must act when occasion required so acutely did mr dashwood feel ungracious behaviour so earnestly did despise daughter in law for on arrival of latter must have quitted house for ever have not entreaty of eldest girl induced first to reflect on propriety of going own tender love for three child determined afterwards to stay for sake avoid breach with brother elinor eldest daughter whose advice be so effectual possessed strength of understanding coolness of judgment qualified though only nineteen to be counsellor of mother enabled frequently to counteract to advantage of that eagerness of mind in mr dashwood must generally have led to imprudence have excellent hearther disposition be affectionate feeling be strong knew how to govern be knowledge mother have yet to learn one of sister have resolved never to be taught mariannes ability be in many respect quite equal to elinors be sensible clever eager in everything sorrow joy must have moderation be generous amiable interesting be everything prudent resemblance between mother be strikingly great elinor saw with concern excess of sister sensibility by mr dashwood be valued cherished encouraged other now in violence of affliction agony of grief overpowered at first be voluntarily renewed be sought for be created again again gave up wholly to sorrow seeking increase of wretchedness in reflection must afford resolved against ever admitting consolation in future elinor too be deeply afflicted still must struggle must exert must consult with brother must receive sister in law on arrival treat with proper attention must strive to rouse mother to similar exertion encourage to similar forbearance margaret other sister be good humored well disposed girl a have already imbibed good deal of mariannes romance without having much of sense did not at thirteen bid fair to equal sister at more advanced period of life chapter ii mr john dashwood now installed mistress of norland mother sister in law be degraded to condition of visitor a such however be treated by with quiet civility by husband with a much kindness a must feel towards anybody beyond wife child really pressed with earnestness to consider norland a home a plan appeared so eligible to mr dashwood a remaining there till must accommodate with house in neighbourhood invitation be accepted continuance in place where everything reminded of former delight be exactly what suited mind in season of cheerfulness temper must be more cheerful than hers posse in greater degree that sanguine expectation of happiness be happiness in sorrow must be equally carried away by fancy a far beyond consolation a in pleasure be beyond alloy mr john dashwood did not at approve of what husband intended to do for sister to take three thousand pound from fortune of dear little boy must be impoverishing to most dreadful degree begged to think again on subject how must answer to to rob child only child too of so large sum what possible claim must miss dashwoods who be related to only by half blood considered a relationship at have on generosity to so large amount be very well known that affection be ever supposed to exist between child of man by different marriage why be to ruin poor little harry by giving away money to half sister be father last request to replied husband must assist widow daughter did not know what be talking of dare say ten to one be light headed at time have be in right sens must not have thought of such thing a begging to give away fortune from own child did not stipulate for particular sum dear fanny only requested in general term to assist make situation more comfortable than be in power to do perhaps must have be a well if have left wholly to myself must hardly suppose must neglect a required promise must not do le than give at least thought so at time promise therefore be given must be performed something must be done for whenever leave settle in new home well then let something be done for that something need not be three thousand pound consider added that when money be once parted with never can return sister will marry will be gone for ever if indeed must be restored to poor little boy why to be sure said husband very gravely that must make great difference time may come when harry will regret that so large sum be parted with if must have numerous family for instance must be very convenient addition to be sure must perhaps then must be better for party if sum be diminished one halffive hundred pound must be prodigious increase to fortune oh beyond anything great what brother on earth must do half so much for sister even if really sister a isonly half bloodbut have generous spirit must not wish to do thing mean replied one have rather on such occasion do too much than too little one at least can think have not done enough for even can hardly expect more there be knowing what may expect said lady be not to think of expectation question be what can afford to do certainlyand think may afford to give five hundred pound piece a be without addition of mine will have about three thousand pound on mother deatha very comfortable fortune for young woman to be sure be indeed strike that can want addition at will have ten thousand pound divided amongst if marry will be sure of doing well if may live very comfortably together on interest of ten thousand pound be very true therefore know whether upon whole must not be more advisable to do something for mother while life rather than for themsomething of annuity kind meanmy sister must feel good effect of a well a hundred year must make perfectly comfortable wife hesitated little however in giving consent to plan to be sure said be better than parting with fifteen hundred pound at once then if mr dashwood must live fifteen year will be completely taken in fifteen year dear fanny life can not be worth half purchase certainly not if observe people always live for ever when there be annuity to be paid be very stout healthy hardly forty annuity be very serious business come over over year there be getting rid of be not aware of what be doing have known great deal of trouble of annuity for mother be clogged with payment of three to old superannuated servant by father will be amazing how disagreeable found twice year annuity be to be paid then there be trouble of getting to then one of be said to have died afterwards turned out to be such thing mother be quite sick of income be not own said with such perpetual claim on be more unkind in father because otherwise money must have be entirely at mother disposal without restriction whatever have given such abhorrence of annuity be sure must not pin down to payment of one for world be certainly unpleasant thing replied mr dashwood to have kind of yearly drain on one income one fortune a mother justly say be not one own to be tied down to regular payment of such sum on rent day be by mean desirable take away one independence undoubtedly after have thanks for think secure do more than what be expected raise gratitude at if be did must be done at own discretion entirely must not bind to allow thing yearly may be very inconvenient year to spare hundred even fifty pound from own expense believe be right love will be better that there must be annuity in case may give occasionally will be of far greater assistance than yearly allowance because must only enlarge style of living if felt sure of larger income must not be sixpence richer for at end of year will certainly be much best way present of fifty pound now then will prevent ever being distressed for money will think be amply discharging promise to father to be sure will indeed to say truth be convinced within that father have idea of giving money at assistance thought of dare say be only such a might be reasonably expected of for instance such a looking out for comfortable small house for helping to move thing sending present of fish game so forth whenever be in season ill lay life that meant nothing farther indeed must be very strange unreasonable if did do consider dear mr dashwood how excessively comfortable mother in law daughter may live on interest of seven thousand pound besides thousand pound belonging to of girl brings in fifty pound year piece of course will pay mother for board out of altogether will have five hundred year amongst what on earth can four woman want for more than thatthey will live so cheap housekeeping will be nothing at will have carriage horse hardly servant will keep company can have expense of kind only conceive how comfortable will be five hundred year be sure can not imagine how will spend half of a to giving more be quite absurd to think of will be much more able to give something upon word said mr dashwood believe be perfectly right father certainly must mean nothing more by request to than what say clearly understand now will strictly fulfil engagement by such act of assistance kindness to a have described when mother remove into house service will be readily given to accommodate a far a can little present of furniture too may be acceptable then certainly returned mr john dashwood however one thing must be considered when father mother moved to norland though furniture of stanhill be sold china plate linen be saved be now left to mother house will therefore be almost completely fitted up a soon a take be material consideration undoubtedly valuable legacy indeed yet of plate must have be very pleasant addition to own stock here yes set of breakfast china be twice a handsome a what belongs to house great deal too handsome in opinion for place can ever afford to live in however so be father thought only of must say owe particular gratitude to attention to wish for very well know that if must must have left almost everything in world to argument be irresistible gave to intention of decision be wanting before finally resolved that must be absolutely unnecessary if not highly indecorous to do more for widow child of father than such kind of neighbourly act a own wife pointed out chapter iii mr dashwood remained at norland several month not from disinclination to move when sight of well known spot ceased to raise violent emotion produced for while for when spirit began to revive mind became capable of other exertion than of heightening affliction by melancholy remembrance be impatient to be gone indefatigable in inquiry for suitable dwelling in neighbourhood of norland for to remove far from beloved spot be impossible must hear of situation at once answered notion of comfort ease suited prudence of eldest daughter whose steadier judgment rejected several house a too large for income mother must have approved mr dashwood have be informed by husband of solemn promise on part of son in favour gave comfort to last earthly reflection doubted sincerity of assurance no more than have doubted thought of for daughter sake with satisfaction though a for herself be persuaded that much smaller provision than must support in affluence for brother sake too for sake of own heart rejoiced reproached for being unjust to merit before in believing incapable of generosity attentive behaviour to herself sister convinced that welfare be dear to for long time firmly relied on liberality of intention contempt have very early in acquaintance felt for daughter in law be very much increased by farther knowledge of character year residence in family afforded perhaps in spite of consideration of politeness maternal affection on side of former two lady might have found impossible to have lived together so long have not particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility according to opinion of mr dashwood to daughter continuance at norland circumstance be growing attachment between eldest girl brother of mr john dashwood gentleman like pleasing young man who be introduced to acquaintance soon after sister establishment at norland who have since spent greatest part of time there mother might have encouraged intimacy from motif of interest for edward ferrars be eldest son of man who have died very rich might have repressed from motif of prudence for except trifling sum whole of fortune depended on will of mother mr dashwood be alike uninfluenced by consideration be enough for that appeared to be amiable that loved daughter that elinor returned partiality be contrary to doctrine of hers difference of fortune must keep couple asunder who be attracted by resemblance of disposition that elinors merit must not be acknowledged by one who knew be to comprehension impossible edward ferrars be not recommended to good opinion by peculiar grace of person address be not handsome manner required intimacy to make pleasing be too diffident to do justice to when natural shyness be overcome behaviour gave indication of open affectionate heart understanding be good education have given solid improvement be neither fitted by ability disposition to answer wish of mother sister who longed to see distinguishedasthey hardly knew what wanted to make fine figure in world in manner other mother wished to interest in political concern to get into parliament to see connected with of great men of day mr john dashwood wished likewise in mean while till one of superior blessing must be attained must have quieted ambition to see driving barouche edward have turn for great men barouche wish centered in domestic comfort quiet of private life fortunately have younger brother who be more promising edward have be staying several week in house before engaged much of mr dashwoods attention for be at time in such affliction a rendered careless of surrounding object saw only that be quiet unobtrusive liked for did not disturb wretchedness of mind by ill timed conversation be first called to observe approve farther by reflection elinor chanced one day to make on difference between sister be contrast recommended most forcibly to mother be enough said to say that be unlike fanny be enough implies everything amiable love already think will like said elinor when know more of like replied mother with smile feel sentiment of approbation inferior to love may esteem have never yet known what be to separate esteem love mr dashwood now took pain to get acquainted with manner be attaching soon banished reserve speedily comprehended merit persuasion of regard for elinor perhaps assisted penetration really felt assured of worth even quietness of manner militated against established idea of what young man address ought to be be longer uninteresting when knew heart to be warm temper affectionate sooner did perceive symptom of love in behaviour to elinor than considered serious attachment a certain looked forward to marriage a rapidly approaching in few month dear marianne said elinor will in probability be settled for life will miss will be happy oh mama how will do without love will be scarcely separation will live within few mile of other will meet day of life will gain brother real affectionate brother have highest opinion in world of edward heart look grave marianne do disapprove sister choice perhaps said marianne may consider with surprise edward be very amiable love tenderly be not kind of young manthere be something wantinghis figure be not striking have none of grace must expect in man who must seriously attach sister eye want spirit that fire at once announce virtue intelligence besides be afraid mama have real taste music seems scarcely to attract though admires elinors drawing very much be not admiration of person who can understand worth be evident in spite of frequent attention to while draw that in fact know nothing of matter admires a lover not a connoisseur to satisfy character must be united must not be happy with man whose taste did not in point coincide with own must enter into feeling same book same music must charm oh mama how spiritless how tame be edward manner in reading to last night felt for sister most severely yet bore with so much composure seemed scarcely to notice must hardly keep seat to hear beautiful line have frequently almost driven wild pronounced with such impenetrable calmness such dreadful indifference must certainly have done more justice to simple elegant prose thought so at time must give cowper nay mama if be not to be animated by cowperbut must allow for difference of taste elinor have not feeling therefore may overlook be happy with must have broke heart have loved to hear read with so little sensibility mama more know of world more be convinced that will never see man whom can really love require so much must have edward virtue person manner must ornament goodness with possible charm remember love that be not seventeen be yet too early in life to despair of such happiness why must be le fortunate than mother in one circumstance only marianne may destiny be different from hers chapter iv what pity be elinor said marianne that edward must have taste for drawing taste for drawing replied elinor why must think so doe not draw indeed have great pleasure in seeing performance of other people assure be by mean deficient in natural taste though have not have opportunity of improving have ever be in way of learning think must have drawn very well distrust own judgment in such matter so much that be always unwilling to give opinion on picture have innate propriety simplicity of taste in general direct perfectly right marianne be afraid of offending said more on subject kind of approbation elinor described a excited in by drawing of other people be very far from rapturous delight in opinion must alone be called taste yet though smiling within at mistake honoured sister for blind partiality to edward produced hope marianne continued elinor consider a deficient in general taste indeed think may say that can not for behaviour to be perfectly cordial if be opinion be sure must never be civil to marianne hardly knew what to say must not wound feeling of sister on account yet to say what did not believe be impossible at length replied be offended elinor if praise of be not in thing equal to sense of merit have not have so many opportunity of estimating minuter propensity of mind inclination taste a have have highest opinion in world of goodness sense think thing be worthy amiable be sure replied elinor with smile that dearest friend must not be dissatisfied with such commendation a perceive how must express more warmly marianne be rejoiced to find sister so easily pleased of sense goodness continued elinor one can think be in doubt who have seen often enough to engage in unreserved conversation excellence of understanding principle can be concealed only by shyness too often keep silent know enough of to do justice to solid worth of minuter propensity a call have from peculiar circumstance be kept more ignorant than have be at time thrown good deal together while have be wholly engrossed on most affectionate principle by mother have seen great deal of have studied sentiment heard opinion on subject of literature taste upon whole venture to pronounce that mind be well informed enjoyment of book exceedingly great imagination lively observation just correct taste delicate pure ability in respect improve a much upon acquaintance a manner person at first sight address be certainly not striking person can hardly be called handsome till expression of eye be uncommonly good general sweetness of countenance be perceived at present know so well that think really handsome at least almost so what say marianne will very soon think handsome elinor if now when tell to love a brother will no more see imperfection in face than now do in heart elinor started at declaration be sorry for warmth have be betrayed into in speaking of felt that edward stood very high in opinion believed regard to be mutual required greater certainty of to make mariannes conviction of attachment agreeable to knew that what marianne mother conjectured one moment believed nextthat with to wish be to hope to hope be to expect tried to explain real state of case to sister attempt to deny said that think very highly of himthat greatly esteem that like marianne here burst forth with indignation esteem like cold hearted elinor oh worse than cold hearted ashamed of being otherwise use word again will leave room moment elinor must not help laughing excuse said be assured that meant offence to by speaking in so quiet way of own feeling believe to be stronger than have declared believe in short to be such a merit suspicionthe hope of affection for may warrant without imprudence folly farther than must not believe be by mean assured of regard for there be moment when extent of seems doubtful till sentiment be fully known can not wonder at wishing to avoid encouragement of own partiality by believing calling more than be in heart feel littlescarcely doubt of preference there be other point to be considered besides inclination be very far from being independent what mother really be can not know from fanny occasional mention of conduct opinion have never be disposed to think amiable be very much mistaken if edward be not aware that there must be many difficulty in way if be to wish to marry woman who have not either great fortune high rank marianne be astonished to find how much imagination of mother have outstripped truth really be not engaged to said yet certainly soon will happen two advantage will proceed from delay will not lose so soon edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for favourite pursuit must be so indispensably necessary to future felicity oh if must be so far stimulated by genius a to learn to draw how delightful must be elinor have given real opinion to sister must not consider partiality for edward in so prosperous state a marianne have believed there be at time want of spirit about if did not denote indifference spoke of something almost a unpromising doubt of regard supposing to feel need not give more than inquietude must not be likely to produce dejection of mind frequently attended more reasonable cause might be found in dependent situation forbade indulgence of affection knew that mother neither behaved to so a to make home comfortable at present to give assurance that might form home for without strictly attending to view for aggrandizement with knowledge a be impossible for elinor to feel easy on subject be far from depending on result of preference of mother sister still considered a certain nay longer be together more doubtful seemed nature of regard sometimes for few painful minute believed to be no more than friendship might really be limit be enough when perceived by sister to make uneasy at same time be still more common to make uncivil took first opportunity of affronting mother in law on occasion talking to so expressively of brother great expectation of mr ferrarss resolution that son must marry well of danger attending young woman who attempted to draw in mr dashwood must neither pretend to be unconscious endeavor to be calm gave answer marked contempt instantly left room resolving that might be inconvenience expense of so sudden removal beloved elinor

written in so friendly style a must not fail of giving pleasure to cousin more especially at moment when be suffering under cold unfeeling behaviour of nearer connection needed time for deliberation inquiry resolution be formed a read situation of barton in county so far distant from sussex a devonshire few hour before must have be sufficient objection to outweigh possible advantage belonging to place be now first recommendation to quit neighbourhood of norland be no longer evil be object of desire be blessing in comparison of misery of continuing daughter in law guest to remove for ever from beloved place must be le painful than to inhabit visit while woman be mistress instantly wrote sir john middleton acknowledgment of kindness acceptance of proposal then hastened to show letter to daughter that might be secure of approbation before answer be sent elinor have always thought must be more prudent for to settle at distance from norland than immediately amongst present acquaintance on head therefore be not for to oppose mother intention of removing into devonshire house too a described by sir john be on so simple scale rent so uncommonly moderate a to leave right of objection on point therefore though be not plan brought charm to fancy though be removal from vicinity of norland beyond wish made attempt to dissuade mother from sending letter of acquiescence chapter v sooner be answer dispatched than mr dashwood indulged in pleasure of announcing to son in law wife that be provided with house must incommode no longer than till thing be ready for inhabiting heard with

promise to father might with particular propriety be fulfilled since have neglected to do on first coming to estate quitting house might be looked on a most suitable period for accomplishment mr dashwood began shortly to give over hope of kind to be convinced from general drift of discourse that assistance extended farther than maintenance for six month at norland so frequently talked of increasing expense of housekeeping of perpetual demand upon purse man of consequence in world be beyond calculation exposed to that seemed rather to stand in need of more money than to have design of giving money away in very few week from day brought sir john middleton first letter to norland thing be so far settled in future abode a to enable mr dashwood daughter to begin journey many be tear

of marianne margaret absolute old bachelor for be on wrong side of five thirty though face be not handsome countenance be sensible address be particularly gentlemanlike there be nothing in of party must recommend a companion to dashwoods cold insipidity of lady middleton be so particularly repulsive that in comparison of gravity of colonel brandon even boisterous mirth of sir john mother in law be interesting lady middleton seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by entrance of four noisy child after dinner who pulled about tore clothes put end to kind of discourse except what related to in evening a marianne be discovered to be musical be invited to play instrument be unlocked body prepared to be charmed marianne who sang very well at request went through chief of song lady middleton

without being in rapture paid only compliment of attention felt respect for on occasion others have reasonably forfeited by shameless want of taste pleasure in music though amounted not to ecstatic

familiarity of long established acquaintance well marianne said elinor a soon a have left for one morning think have done pretty well have already ascertained mr willoughbys opinion in almost matter of importance know what think of cowper scott be certain of estimating beauty a ought have received assurance of admiring pope no more than be proper how be acquaintance to be long supported under

circumstance in hastily forming giving opinion of other people in sacrificing general politeness to enjoyment of undivided attention where heart be engaged in slighting too easily form of worldly propriety displayed want of caution elinor must not approve in spite of that marianne must say in support marianne began now to perceive that desperation have seized at sixteen half of ever seeing man who must satisfy idea of perfection have be rash unjustifiable willoughby be that fancy have delineated in unhappy hour in brighter period a capable of attaching behaviour declared wish to be in respect a earnest a ability be strong mother too in whose mind not one speculative thought of marriage have be raised by prospect of rich be led before end of week to hope expect secretly to congratulate on having gained two such son in law a edward willoughby colonel brandons partiality for marianne have so early be discovered by friend now first became perceptible to elinor when ceased to be noticed by attention wit be drawn off to more fortunate rival raillery other have incurred before partiality arose be removed when feeling began really to call for ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility elinor be obliged though unwillingly to believe that sentiment mr jennings have assigned for own satisfaction be now actually excited by sister that however general resemblance of disposition between party might forward affection of mr willoughby equally striking opposition of character be hindrance to regard of colonel brandon saw with concern for what must silent man of five thirty hope when opposed to very lively one of five twenty a must not even wish successful heartily wished indifferent liked himin spite of gravity reserve beheld in object of interest manner though serious be mild reserve appeared rather result of oppression of spirit than of natural gloominess of temper sir john have dropped hint of past injury disappointment justified belief of being unfortunate man regarded with respect compassion perhaps pitied esteemed more because be slighted by willoughby marianne who prejudiced against for being lively young seemed resolved to undervalue merit brandon be just kind of man said willoughby one day when be talking of together whom body speaks well of nobody care about whom be delighted to see nobody remembers to talk to be exactly what think of cried marianne boast of however said elinor for be injustice in of be highly esteemed by family at park never see without taking pain to converse with that be patronised by replied willoughby be certainly in favour a for esteem of others be reproach in who must submit to indignity of being approved by woman a lady middleton mr jennings must command indifference of body else perhaps abuse of such people a marianne will make amends for regard of lady middleton mother if praise be censure censure may be praise for be not more undiscerning than be prejudiced unjust in defence of protg can even be saucy protg a call be sensible man sense will always have attraction for yes marianne even in man between thirty forty have seen great deal of world have be abroad have read have thinking mind have found capable of giving much information on various subject have always answered inquiry with readiness of good breeding good nature be to say cried marianne contemptuously have told that in east indie climate be hot mosquito be troublesome must have told so doubt not have made such inquiry happened to be point on have be previously informed perhaps said willoughby observation may have extended to existence of nabob gold mohrs palanquin may venture to say that observation have stretched much further than candour why must dislike dislike consider on contrary a very respectable man who have body good word nobody notice who have more money than can spend more time than know how to employ two new coat year add to cried marianne that have genius taste spirit that understanding have brilliancy feeling ardour voice expression decide on imperfection so much in mass replied elinor so much on strength of own imagination that commendation be able to give of be comparatively cold insipid can only pronounce to be sensible man well bred well informed of gentle address believe possessing amiable heart miss dashwood cried willoughby be now using unkindly be endeavouring to disarm by reason to convince against will will not do will find a stubborn a can be artful have three unanswerable reason for disliking colonel brandon threatened with rain when wanted to be fine have found fault with hanging of curricle can not persuade to buy brown mare if will be satisfaction to however to be told that believe character to be in other respect irreproachable be ready to confess in return for acknowledgment must give pain can not deny privilege of disliking a much a ever chapter xi little have mr dashwood daughter imagined when first came into devonshire so many engagement must arise to occupy time a shortly presented that must have such frequent invitation such constant visitor a to leave little leisure for serious employment yet such be case when marianne be recovered scheme of amusement at home abroad sir john have be previously forming be put into execution private ball at park then began party on water be made accomplished a often a showery october must allow in meeting of kind willoughby be included ease familiarity naturally attended party be exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to acquaintance with dashwoods to afford opportunity of witnessing excellency of marianne of marking animated admiration of of receiving in behaviour to most pointed assurance of affection elinor must not be surprised at attachment only wished that be le openly shown once twice did venture to suggest propriety of self command to marianne marianne abhorred concealment where real disgrace must attend unreserve to aim at restraint of sentiment be not in illaudable appeared to not merely unnecessary effort disgraceful subjection of reason to common place mistaken notion thought same behaviour at time be illustration of opinion when be present have eye for one else thing did be right thing said be clever if evening at park be concluded with card cheated rest of party to get good hand if dancing formed amusement of night be partner for time when obliged to separate for couple of dance be careful to stand together scarcely spoke word to body else such conduct made of course most exceedingly laughed at ridicule must not shame seemed hardly to provoke mr dashwood entered into feeling with warmth left inclination for checking excessive display of to be natural consequence of strong affection in young ardent mind be season of happiness to marianne heart be devoted to willoughby fond attachment to norland brought with from sussex be more likely to be softened than have thought possible before by charm society bestowed on present home elinors happiness be not so great heart be not so much at ease satisfaction in amusement so pure afforded companion must make amends for what have left behind must teach to think of norland with le regret than ever lady middleton mr jennings must supply to conversation missed although latter be everlasting talker from first have regarded with kindness ensured large share of discourse have already repeated own history to elinor three four time have elinors memory be equal to mean of improvement might have known very early in acquaintance particular of mr jenningss last illness what said to wife few minute before died lady middleton be more agreeable than mother only in being more silent elinor needed little observation to perceive that reserve be mere calmness of manner with sense have nothing to do towards husband mother be same a to intimacy be therefore to be looked for desired have nothing to say one day that have not said day before insipidity be invariable for even spirit be always same though did not oppose party arranged by husband provided thing be conducted in style two eldest child attended never appeared to receive more enjoyment from than might have experienced in sitting at homeand so little did presence add to pleasure of others by share in conversation that be sometimes only reminded of being amongst by solicitude about troublesome boy in colonel brandon alone of new acquaintance did elinor find person who must in degree claim respect of ability excite interest of friendship give pleasure a companion willoughby be out of question admiration regard even sisterly regard be own be lover attention be wholly mariannes far le agreeable man might have be more generally pleasing colonel brandon unfortunately for have such encouragement to think only of marianne in conversing with elinor found greatest consolation for indifference of sister elinors compassion for increased a have reason to suspect that misery of disappointed love have already be known to suspicion be given by word accidentally dropped from one evening at park when be sitting down together by mutual consent while others be dancing eye be fixed on marianne after silence of minute said with faint smile sister understand doe not approve of second attachment replied elinor opinion be romantic rather a believe considers impossible to exist believe doe how contrives without reflecting on character of own father who have two wife know not few year however will settle opinion on reasonable basis of common sense observation then may be more easy to define to justify than now be by body will probably be case replied yet there be something so amiable in prejudice of young mind that one be sorry to see give way to reception of more general opinion can not agree with there said elinor there be inconvenience attending such feeling a mariannes charm of enthusiasm ignorance of world can not atone for system have unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought better acquaintance with world be what look forward to a greatest possible advantage after short pause resumed conversation by saying doe sister make distinction in objection against second attachment be equally criminal in body be who have be disappointed in first choice whether from inconstancy of object perverseness of circumstance to be equally indifferent during rest of life upon word be not acquainted with minutia of principle only know never yet heard admit instance of second attachment being pardonable said can not hold change total change of sentimentsno desire for when romantic refinement of young mind be obliged to give way how frequently be succeeded by such opinion a be too common too dangerous speak from experience once knew lady who in temper mind greatly resembled sister who thought judged like who from enforced changefrom series of unfortunate circumstance here stopt suddenly appeared to think that have said too much by countenance gave rise to conjecture might not otherwise have entered elinors head lady must probably have passed without suspicion have not convinced miss dashwood that what concerned ought not to escape lip a be required slight effort of fancy to connect emotion with tender recollection of past regard elinor attempted more marianne in place must not have done so little whole story must have be speedily formed under active imagination thing established in most melancholy order of disastrous love chapter xii a elinor marianne be walking together next morning latter communicated piece of news to sister in spite of that knew before of mariannes imprudence want of thought surprised by extravagant testimony of marianne told with greatest delight willoughby have given horse one have bred on estate in somersetshire be exactly calculated to carry woman without considering that be not in mother plan to keep horse that if be to alter resolution in favour of gift must buy for servant keep servant to ride after build stable to receive have accepted present without hesitation told sister of in rapture intends to send groom into somersetshire immediately for added when arrives will ride day will share use with imagine to yourself dear elinor delight of gallop on of down most unwilling be to awaken from such dream of felicity to comprehend unhappy truth attended affair for time refused to submit to a to additional servant expense must be trifle mama be sure must never object to horse must do for might always get one at park a to stable merest shed must be sufficient elinor then ventured to doubt propriety of receiving present from man so little at least so lately known to be too much be mistaken elinor said warmly in supposing know very little of willoughby have not known long indeed be much better acquainted with than be with other creature in world except mama be not time opportunity be to determine intimacyit be disposition alone seven year must be insufficient to make people acquainted with other seven day be more than enough for others must hold guilty of greater impropriety in accepting horse from brother than from willoughby of john know very little though have lived together for year of willoughby judgment have long be formed elinor thought wisest to touch point more knew sister temper opposition on so tender subject must only attach more to own opinion by appeal to affection for mother by representing inconvenience indulgent mother must draw on if a must probably be case consented to increase of establishment marianne be shortly subdued promised not to tempt mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning offer to tell willoughby when saw next that must be declined be faithful to word when willoughby called at cottage same day elinor heard express disappointment to in low voice on being obliged to forego acceptance of present reason for alteration be at same time related be such a to make further entreaty on side impossible concern however be very apparent after expressing with earnestness added in same low voicebut marianne horse be still yours though can not use now will keep only till can claim when leave barton to form own establishment in more lasting home queen mab will receive be overheard by miss dashwood in whole of sentence in manner of pronouncing in addressing sister by christian name alone instantly saw intimacy so decided meaning so direct a marked perfect agreement between from moment doubted not of being engaged to other belief of created other surprise than of friend must be left by temper so

lock of hair for be tumbled down back kissed folded up in piece of white paper put into pocket book for such particular stated on such authority elinor must not withhold credit be disposed to for circumstance be in perfect unison with what have heard seen margarets sagacity be not always displayed in way so satisfactory to sister when mr jennings attacked one evening at park to give name of young man who be elinors particular favourite have be long matter of great curiosity to margaret answered by looking at sister saying must not tell may elinor of course made body laugh elinor tried to laugh too effort be painful be convinced that margaret have fixed on person whose name must not bear with composure to become standing joke with mr jennings marianne felt for most sincerely did more harm than good to cause by turning very red saying in angry manner to margaret remember that conjecture may be have right to repeat never have conjecture about replied margaret be who told of

sister in town winter miss dashwood be afraid none at then must bid farewell for longer time than must wish to do to marianne merely bowed said nothing come colonel said mr jennings before go do let know what be going about wished good morning attended by sir john left room complaint lamentation politeness have hitherto restrained now burst forth universally agreed again again how provoking be to be so disappointed can guess what business be however said mr jennings exultingly can maam said almost body yes be about miss williams be sure who be miss williams asked marianne what know who miss williams be be sure must have heard of before be relation of colonel dear very near relation will not say how near for fear of shocking young lady then lowering voice little said to elinor be natural daughter indeed oh yes a like a can stare dare say colonel will leave fortune when sir john returned joined most heartily in general regret on so unfortunate event concluding however by observing that a be got together must do something by way of being happy after consultation be agreed that although happiness must only be enjoyed at whitwell might procure tolerable composure of mind by driving about country carriage be then ordered willoughbys be first marianne never looked happier than when got into drove through park very fast be soon out of sight nothing more of be seen till return did not happen till after return of rest seemed delighted with drive said only in general term that have kept in lane while others went on down be settled that there must be dance in evening that body must be extremely merry day long more of careys came to dinner have pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table sir john observed with great contentment willoughby took usual place between two elder miss dashwoods mr jennings sat on elinors right hand have not be long seated before leant behind willoughby said to marianne loud enough for to hear have found out in spite of trick know where spent morning marianne coloured replied very hastily where pray did not know said willoughby that have be out in curricle yes yes mr impudence know very well be determined to find out where have be to hope like house miss marianne be very large one know when come to see hope will have new furnished for wanted very much when be there six year ago marianne turned away in great confusion mr jennings laughed heartily elinor found that in resolution to know where have be have actually made own woman enquire of mr willoughbys groom that have by method be informed that have gone to allenham spent considerable time there in walking about garden going over house elinor must hardly believe to be true a seemed very unlikely that willoughby must propose marianne consent to enter house while mr smith be in with whom marianne have not smallest acquaintance a soon a left dining room elinor enquired of about great be surprise when found that circumstance related by mr jennings be perfectly true marianne be quite angry with for doubting why must imagine elinor that did not go there that did not see house be not what have often wished to do yes marianne must not go while mr smith be there with other companion than mr willoughby mr willoughby however be only person who can have right to show house a went in open carriage be impossible to have other companion never spent pleasanter morning in life be afraid replied elinor that pleasantness of employment doe not always evince propriety on contrary nothing can be stronger proof of elinor for if there have be real impropriety in what did must have be sensible of at time for always know when be acting wrong with such conviction must have have pleasure dear marianne a have already exposed to very impertinent remark do not now begin to doubt discretion of own conduct if impertinent remark of mr jennings be to be proof of impropriety in conduct be offending moment of life value not censure more than must do commendation be not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over mr smith ground in seeing house will one day be mr willoughbys if be one day to be own marianne must not be justified in what have done blushed at hint be even visibly gratifying to after ten minute interval of earnest thought came to sister again said with great good humour perhaps elinor be rather ill judged in to go to allenham mr willoughby wanted particularly to show place be charming house assure youthere be one remarkably pretty sitting room up stair of nice comfortable size for constant use with modern furniture must be delightful be corner room have window on two side on one side look across bowling green behind house to beautiful hanging wood on other have view of church village beyond of fine bold hill that have so often admired did not see to advantage for nothing must be more forlorn than furniturebut if be newly fitted upa couple of hundred pound willoughby say must make one of pleasantest summer room in england must elinor have listened to without interruption from others must have described room in house with equal delight chapter xiv sudden termination of colonel brandons visit at park with steadiness in concealing cause filled mind raised wonder of mr jennings for two three day be great wonderer a one must be who take very lively interest in coming going of acquaintance wondered with little intermission what must be reason of be sure there must be bad news thought over kind of distress must have befallen with fixed determination that must not escape something very melancholy must be matter be sure said must see in face poor man be afraid circumstance may be bad estate at delaford be never reckoned more than two thousand year brother left everything sadly involved do think must have be sent for about money matter for what else can be wonder whether be so must give anything to know truth of perhaps be about miss williams by bye dare say be because looked so conscious when mentioned may be be ill in town nothing in world more likely for have notion be always rather sickly must lay wager be about miss williams be not so very likely must be distressed in circumstance now for be very prudent man to be sure must have cleared estate by time wonder what can be may be sister be worse at avignon have sent for over setting off in such hurry seems very like well wish out of trouble with heart good wife into bargain so wondered so talked mr jennings opinion varying with fresh conjecture seeming equally probable a arose elinor though felt really interested in welfare of colonel brandon must not bestow wonder on going so suddenly away mr jennings be desirous of feeling for besides that circumstance did not in opinion justify such lasting amazement variety of speculation wonder be otherwise disposed of be engrossed by extraordinary silence of sister willoughby on subject must know to be peculiarly interesting to a silence continued day made appear more strange more incompatible with disposition of why must not openly acknowledge to mother what constant behaviour to other declared to have taken place elinor must not imagine must easily conceive marriage might not be immediately in power for though willoughby be independent there be reason to believe rich estate have be rated by sir john at about six seven hundred year lived at expense to income must hardly be equal have often complained of poverty for strange kind of secrecy maintained by relative to engagement in fact concealed nothing at must not account be so wholly contradictory to general opinion practice that doubt sometimes entered mind of being really engaged doubt be enough to prevent making inquiry of marianne nothing must be more expressive of attachment to than willoughbys behaviour to marianne have distinguishing tenderness lover heart must give to rest of family be affectionate attention of son brother cottage seemed to be considered loved by a home many more of hour be spent there than at allenham if general engagement collected at park exercise called out in morning be almost certain of ending there where rest of day be spent by at side of marianne by favourite pointer at foot one evening in particular about week after colonel brandon left country heart seemed more than usually open to feeling of attachment to object around on mr dashwoods happening to mention design of improving cottage in spring warmly opposed alteration of place affection have established a perfect with what exclaimedimprove dear cottage will never consent to not stone must be added to wall not inch to size if feeling be regarded be alarmed said miss dashwood nothing of kind will be done for mother will never have money enough to attempt be heartily glad of cried may always be poor if can employ rich better thank willoughby may be assured must not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours of one whom loved for improvement in world depend upon that unemployed sum may remain when make up account in spring must even rather lay uselessly by than dispose of in manner so painful to be really so attached to place a to see defect in be said to be faultless nay more consider a only form of building in happiness be attainable be rich enough must instantly pull combe down build up again in exact plan of cottage with dark narrow stair kitchen smoke suppose said elinor yes cried in same eager tone with thing belonging to itin one convenience inconvenience about must least variation be perceptible then then only under roof might perhaps be a happy at combe a have be at barton flatter replied elinor that even under disadvantage of better room broader staircase will hereafter find own house a faultless a now do there certainly be circumstance said willoughby might greatly endear to place will always have one claim of affection other can possibly share mr dashwood looked with pleasure at marianne whose fine eye be fixed so expressively on willoughby a plainly denoted how well understood how often did wish added when be at allenham time twelvemonth that barton cottage be inhabited never passed within view of without admiring situation grieving that one must live in how little did then think that very first news must hear from mr smith when next came into country must be that barton cottage be taken felt immediate satisfaction interest in event nothing kind of prescience of what happiness must experience from can account for must not have be so marianne speaking to in lowered voice then continuing former tone said yet house must spoil mr dashwood must rob of simplicity by imaginary improvement dear parlour in acquaintance first began in so many happy hour have be since spent by together must degrade to condition of common entrance body must be eager to pas through room have hitherto contained within more real accommodation comfort than other apartment of handsomest dimension in world must possibly afford mr dashwood again assured that alteration of kind must be attempted be good woman warmly replied promise make easy extend little farther will make happy tell that not only house will remain same that will ever find yours a unchanged a dwelling that will always consider with kindness have made everything belonging to so dear to promise be readily given willoughbys behaviour during whole of evening declared at once affection happiness will see tomorrow to dinner said mr dashwood when be leaving ask to come in morning for must walk to park to call on lady middleton engaged to be with by four oclock chapter xv mr dashwoods visit to lady middleton took place next day two of daughter went with marianne excused from being of party under trifling pretext of employment mother who concluded that promise have be made by willoughby night before of calling on while be absent be perfectly satisfied with remaining at home on return from park found willoughbys curricle servant in waiting at cottage mr dashwood be convinced that conjecture have be just so far be all a have foreseen on entering house beheld what foresight have taught to expect be sooner in passage than marianne came hastily out of parlour apparently in violent affliction with handkerchief at eye without noticing ran up stair surprised alarmed proceeded directly into room have just quitted where found only willoughby who be leaning against mantel piece with back towards turned round on coming in countenance showed that strongly partook of emotion over powered marianne be anything matter with cried mr dashwood a enteredis ill hope not replied trying to look cheerful with forced smile presently added be who may rather expect to be illfor be now suffering under very heavy disappointment disappointment yes for be unable to keep engagement with mr smith have morning exercised privilege of rich upon poor dependent cousin by sending on business to london have just received dispatch taken farewell of allenham by way of exhilaration be now come to take farewell of to londonand be going morning almost moment be very unfortunate mr smith must be obligedand business will not detain from long hope coloured a replied be very kind have idea of returning into devonshire immediately visit to mr smith be never repeated within twelvemonth be mr smith only friend be allenham only house in neighbourhood to will be welcome for shame willoughby can wait for invitation here colour increased with eye fixed on ground only replied be too good mr dashwood looked at elinor with surprise elinor felt equal amazement for few moment one be silent mr dashwood first spoke have only to add dear willoughby at barton cottage will always be welcome for will not press to return here immediately because only can judge how far might be pleasing to mr smith on head will be no more disposed to question judgment than to doubt inclination engagement at present replied willoughby confusedly be of such naturethati dare not flatter stopped mr dashwood be too much astonished to speak pause succeeded be broken by willoughby who said with faint smile be folly to linger in manner will not torment longer by remaining among friend whose society be impossible for now to enjoy then hastily took leave of left room saw step into carriage in minute be out of sight mr dashwood felt too much for speech instantly quitted parlour to give way in solitude to concern alarm sudden departure occasioned elinors uneasiness be at least equal to mother thought of what have just passed with anxiety distrust willoughbys behaviour in taking leave of embarrassment affectation of cheerfulness above unwillingness to accept mother invitation backwardness so unlike lover so unlike greatly disturbed one moment feared that serious design have ever be formed on side next that unfortunate quarrel have taken place between sisterthe distress in marianne have quitted room be such a serious quarrel must most reasonably account for though when considered what mariannes love for be quarrel seemed almost impossible might be particular of separation sister affliction be indubitable thought with tenderest compassion of violent sorrow marianne be in probability not merely giving way to a relief feeding encouraging a duty in about hour mother returned though eye be red countenance be not uncheerful dear willoughby be now mile from barton elinor said a sat down to work with how heavy heart doe travel be very strange so suddenly to be gone seems work of moment last night be with so happy so cheerful so affectionate now after only ten minute noticegone too without intending to returnsomething more than what owned to must have happened did not speak did not behave like must have seen difference a well a what can be can have quarrelled why else must have shown such unwillingness to accept invitation here be not inclination that wanted elinor must plainly see that have not power of accepting have thought over assure can perfectly account for thing at first seemed strange to a well a to can indeed yes have explained to myself in most satisfactory waybut elinor who love to doubt where canit will not satisfy know will not talk out of trust in be persuaded that mr smith suspect regard for marianne disapproves of perhaps because have other view for on account be eager to get awayand that business sends off to transact be invented a excuse to dismiss be what believe to have happened be moreover aware that doe disapprove connection dare not therefore at present confess to engagement with marianne feel obliged from dependent situation to give into scheme absent from devonshire for while will tell know that may may not have happened will listen to cavil unless can point out other method of understanding affair a satisfactory at now elinor what have to say nothing for have anticipated answer then must have told that might might not have happened oh elinor how incomprehensible be feeling have rather take evil upon credit than good have rather look out for misery for marianne guilt for poor willoughby than apology for latter be resolved to think blameable because took leave of with le affection than usual behaviour have shown be allowance to be made for inadvertence for spirit depressed by recent disappointment be probability to be accepted merely because be not certainty be nothing due to man whom have such reason to love reason in world to think ill of to possibility of motif unanswerable in though unavoidably secret for while after what be suspect of can hardly tell suspicion of something unpleasant be inevitable consequence of such alteration a just witnessed in there be great truth however in what have now urged of allowance ought to be made for be wish to be candid in judgment of body willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reason for conduct will hope that have must have be more like willoughby to acknowledge at once secrecy may be advisable still can not help wondering at being practiced by blame however for departing from character where deviation be necessary really do admit justice of what have said in defencei be happyand be acquitted not entirely may be proper to conceal engagement if be engaged from mr smithand if be case must be highly expedient for willoughby to be little in devonshire at present be excuse for concealing from concealing from dear child do accuse willoughby marianne of concealment be strange indeed when eye have be reproaching day for incautiousness want proof of affection said elinor of engagement do be perfectly satisfied of yet not syllable have be said to on subject by of have not wanted syllable where action have spoken so plainly have not behaviour to marianne to of for at least last fortnight declared that loved considered a future wife that felt for attachment of nearest relation have not perfectly understood other have not consent be daily asked by look manner attentive affectionate respect elinor be possible to doubt engagement how must such thought occur to how be to be supposed that willoughby persuaded a must be of sister love must leave leave perhaps for month without telling of affectionthat must part without mutual exchange of confidence confess replied elinor that circumstance except one be in favour of engagement that one be total silence of on subject with almost outweighs other how strange be must think wretchedly indeed of willoughby if after have openly passed between can doubt nature of term on be together have be acting part in behaviour to sister time do suppose really indifferent to can not think that must doe love be sure with strange kind of tenderness if can leave with such indifference such carelessness of future a attribute to must remember dear mother have never considered matter a certain have have doubt confess be fainter than be may soon be entirely done away if find correspond fear of mine will be removed mighty concession indeed if be to see at altar must suppose be going to be married ungracious girl require such proof nothing in opinion have ever passed to justify doubt secrecy have be attempted have be uniformly open unreserved can not doubt sister wish must be willoughby therefore whom suspect why be not man of honour feeling have there be inconsistency on side to create alarm can be deceitful hope not believe not cried elinor love willoughby sincerely love suspicion of integrity can not be more painful to than to have be involuntary will not encourage be startled confess by alteration in manner morninghe did not speak like did not return kindness with cordiality may be explained by such situation of affair a have supposed have just parted from sister have seen leave in greatest affliction if felt obliged from fear of offending mr smith to resist temptation of returning here soon yet aware that by declining invitation by saying that be going away for time must seem to act ungenerous suspicious part by family might well be embarrassed disturbed in such case plain open avowal of difficulty must have be more to honour think a well a more consistent with general characterbut will not raise objection against one conduct on so illiberal foundation a difference in judgment from deviation from what may think right consistent speak very properly willoughby certainly doe not deserve to be suspected though have not known long be stranger in part of world who have ever spoken to disadvantage have be in situation to act independently marry immediately might have be odd that must leave without acknowledging everything to at once be not case be engagement in respect not prosperously begun for marriage must be at very uncertain distance even secrecy a far a can be observed may now be very advisable be interrupted by entrance of margaret elinor be then at liberty to think over representation of mother to acknowledge probability of many hope for justice of saw nothing of marianne till dinner time when entered room took place at table without saying word eye be red swollen seemed a if tear be even then restrained with difficulty avoided look of must neither eat speak after time on mother silently pressing hand with tender compassion small degree of fortitude be quite overcome burst into tear left room violent oppression of spirit continued whole evening be without power because be without desire of command over slightest mention of anything relative to willoughby overpowered in instant though family be most anxiously attentive to comfort be impossible for if spoke at to keep clear of subject feeling connected with chapter xvi marianne must have thought very inexcusable have be able to sleep at first night after parting from willoughby must have be ashamed to look family in face next morning have not risen from bed in more need of repose than when lay down in feeling made such composure disgrace left in danger of incurring be awake whole night wept greatest part of got up with headache be unable to talk unwilling to take nourishment giving pain moment to mother sister forbidding attempt at consolation from sensibility be potent enough when breakfast be over walked out by wandered about village of allenham indulging recollection of past enjoyment cry over present reverse for chief of morning evening passed off in equal indulgence of feeling played over favourite song that have be used to play to willoughby air in voice have be oftenest joined sat at instrument gazing on line of music that have written out for till heart be so heavy that farther sadness must be gained nourishment of grief be day applied spent whole hour at pianoforte alternately singing cry voice often totally suspended by tear in book too a well a in music courted misery contrast between past present be certain of giving read nothing what have be used to read together such violence of affliction indeed must not be supported for ever sunk within few day into calmer melancholy employment to daily recurred solitary walk silent meditation still produced occasional effusion of sorrow a lively a ever letter from willoughby came none seemed expected by marianne mother be surprised elinor again became uneasy mr dashwood must find explanation whenever wanted at least satisfied remember elinor said how very often sir john fetch letter from post carry to have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary must acknowledge that must not be maintained if correspondence be to pas through sir john hand elinor must not deny truth of tried to find in motive sufficient for silence there be one method so direct so simple in opinion so eligible of knowing real state of affair of instantly removing mystery that must not help suggesting to mother why do not ask marianne at once said whether be be not engaged to willoughby from mother so kind so indulgent mother question must not give offence must be natural result of affection for used to be unreserve to more especially must not ask such question for world supposing possible that be not engaged what distress must not such enquiry inflict at rate must be most ungenerous must never deserve confidence again after forcing from confession of what be meant at present to be unacknowledged to one know mariannes heart know that dearly love that will not be last to whom affair be made known when circumstance make revealment of eligible must not attempt to force confidence of one of child much le because sense of duty must prevent denial wish might direct elinor thought generosity overstrained considering sister youth urged matter farther in vain common sense common care common prudence be sunk in mr dashwoods romantic delicacy be several day before willoughbys name be mentioned before marianne by of family sir john mr jennings indeed be not so nice witticism added pain to many painful hourbut one evening mr dashwood accidentally taking up volume of shakespeare exclaimed have never finished hamlet marianne dear willoughby went away before must get through will put by when come againbut may be month perhaps before happens month cried marianne with strong surprise nonor many week mr dashwood be sorry for what have said gave elinor

walk instead of wandering away by hitherto have carefully avoided companion in ramble if sister intended to walk on down directly stole away towards lane if talked of valley be a speedy in climbing hill must never be found when others set off at length be secured by exertion of elinor who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion walked along road through valley chiefly in silence for mariannes mind must not be controlled elinor satisfied with gaining one point must not then attempt more beyond entrance of valley where country though still rich be le wild more open long stretch of

great cordiality especially by marianne who showed more warmth of regard in reception of than even elinor to marianne indeed meeting between edward sister be continuation of unaccountable coldness

pleasure in seeing looked neither rapturous gay said little what be forced from by question distinguished elinor by mark of affection marianne saw listened with increasing surprise began almost to feel dislike of edward ended a feeling must end with by carrying back thought to willoughby whose manner formed contrast sufficiently striking to of brother elect after short silence succeeded first surprise enquiry of meeting marianne asked edward if came directly from london no have be in devonshire fortnight fortnight repeated surprised at being so long in same county with elinor without seeing before looked rather distressed a added that have be staying with friend near plymouth have be lately in sussex said elinor be at norland about month ago how doe dear dear norland look cried

greatness will not make so strange that must cried marianne what have wealth grandeur to do with happiness grandeur have little said elinor wealth have much to do with elinor for shame said marianne money can only give happiness where there be nothing else to give beyond competence can afford real satisfaction a far a mere self be concerned perhaps said elinor smiling may come to same point

be only grown little more grave than be nay edward said marianne need not reproach be not very gay why must think so replied with sigh gaiety never be part of character do think part of mariannes said elinor must hardly call lively girlshe be very earnest very eager in doessometimes talk great deal always with animationbut be not often really merry believe be right replied yet have always set down a lively girl have frequently detected in such kind of mistake said elinor in total misapprehension of character in point other fancying people so much more gay grave ingenious stupid than really be can hardly tell why in what deception originated sometimes one be guided by what say of very frequently by what other people say of without giving time to deliberate judge thought be right elinor said marianne to be guided wholly by opinion of other people thought judgment be given merely to be subservient to of neighbour have always be doctrine be sure marianne never doctrine have never aimed at subjection of understanding have ever attempted to influence have be behaviour must not confound meaning be guilty confess of having often wished to treat acquaintance in general with greater attention when have advised to adopt sentiment to conform to judgment in serious matter have not be able to bring sister over to plan of general civility said edward to elinor do gain ground quite contrary replied elinor looking expressively at marianne judgment returned be on side of question be afraid practice be much more on sister never wish to offend be so foolishly shy often seem negligent when be only kept back by natural awkwardness have frequently thought that must have be intended by nature to be fond of low company be so little at ease among stranger of gentility marianne have not shyness to excuse inattention of hers said elinor know own worth too well for false shame replied edward shyness be only effect of sense of inferiority in way other if must persuade that manner be perfectly easy graceful must not be shy must still be reserved said marianne be worse edward startedreserved be reserved marianne yes very understand replied colouring reservedhow in what manner what be to tell what can suppose elinor looked surprised at emotion trying to laugh off subject said to know sister well enough to understand what mean know call one reserved who doe not talk a

of friend visit afforded very partial satisfaction while own enjoyment in appeared so imperfect be evident that be unhappy wished be equally evident that still distinguished by same affection once have felt doubt of inspiring continuance of preference seemed very uncertain reservedness of manner towards contradicted one moment what more animated look have intimated preceding one joined marianne in breakfast room next morning before others be down marianne who be always eager to promote happiness a far a must soon left to before be half way upstairs heard parlour door open turning round be astonished to see edward come out be going into village to see horse said a be not yet ready for breakfast will be back again presently edward returned to with fresh admiration of surrounding country in walk to village have seen many part of valley to advantage village in much higher situation than cottage afforded general view of whole have exceedingly pleased be subject ensured mariannes attention be beginning to describe own admiration of scene to question more minutely on object have particularly struck when edward interrupted by saying must not enquire too far marianneremember have knowledge in picturesque will offend by ignorance want of taste if come to particular will call hill steep ought to be bold surface strange uncouth ought to be irregular rugged distant object out of sight ought only to be indistinct through soft medium of hazy atmosphere must be satisfied with such admiration a can honestly give call very fine countrythe hill be steep wood seem full of fine timber valley look comfortable snugwith rich meadow several neat farm house scattered here there exactly answer idea of fine country because unites beauty with utilityand dare say be picturesque one too because admire can easily believe to be full of rock promontory grey moss brush wood be lost on know nothing of picturesque be afraid be too true said marianne why must boast of suspect said elinor that to avoid one kind of affectation edward here fall into because belief many people pretend to more admiration of beauty of nature than really feel be disgusted with such pretension affect greater indifference le discrimination in viewing than posse be fastidious will have affectation of own be very true said marianne that admiration of landscape scenery be become mere jargon body pretend to feel try to describe with taste elegance of who first defined what picturesque beauty be detest jargon of kind sometimes have kept feeling to myself because must find language to describe in what be worn hackneyed out of sense meaning be convinced said edward that really feel delight in fine prospect profess to feel in return sister must allow to feel no more than profess like fine

more pleasure in snug farm house than watch towerand troop of tidy happy villager please better than finest bandit in world marianne looked with amazement at edward with compassion at sister elinor only laughed subject be continued farther marianne remained thoughtfully silent till new object suddenly engaged attention be sitting by edward in taking tea from mr dashwood hand passed so directly before a to make ring with plait of hair in centre very conspicuous on one of finger never saw wear ring before edward cried be that fanny hair remember promising to give must have thought hair have be darker marianne spoke inconsiderately what really feltbut when saw how much have pained edward own vexation at want of thought must not be surpassed by coloured very deeply giving momentary glance at elinor replied yes be sister hair setting always cast different shade on know elinor have met eye looked conscious likewise that hair be own instantaneously felt a well satisfied a marianne only difference in conclusion be that what marianne considered a free gift from sister elinor be conscious must have be procured by theft contrivance unknown to herself be not in humour however to regard a affront affecting to take notice of what passed by instantly talking of something else internally resolved henceforward to catch opportunity of eyeing hair of satisfying beyond doubt that be exactly shade of own edward embarrassment lasted time ended in absence of mind still more settled be particularly grave whole morning marianne severely censured for what have said own forgiveness might have be more speedy have known how little offence have given sister before middle of day be visited by sir john mr jennings who having heard of arrival of gentleman at cottage came to take survey of guest with assistance of mother in law sir john be not long in discovering that name of ferrars began with f prepared future mine of raillery against devoted elinor nothing newness of acquaintance with edward must have prevented from being immediately sprung a be only learned from very significant look how far penetration founded on margarets instruction extended sir john never came to dashwoods without inviting to dine at park next day to drink tea with evening on present occasion for better entertainment of visitor towards whose amusement felt bound to contribute wished to engage for must drink tea with to night said for will be quite aloneand tomorrow must absolutely dine with for will be large party mr jennings enforced necessity who know may raise dance said will tempt miss marianne dance cried marianne impossible who be to dance who why yourselves careys whitakers to be surewhat thought nobody must dance because certain person that will be nameless be gone wish with soul cried sir john willoughby be among again mariannes blushing gave new suspicion to edward who be willoughby said in low voice to miss dashwood by whom be sitting gave brief reply mariannes countenance be more communicative edward saw enough to comprehend not only meaning of others such of mariannes expression a have puzzled before when visitor left went immediately round said in whisper have be guessing will tell guess what do mean will tell certainly well then guess that mr willoughby hunt marianne be surprised confused yet must not help smiling at quiet archness of manner after moment silence said oh edward how can youbut time will come hopei be sure will like doubt replied rather astonished at earnestness warmth for have not imagined to be joke for good of acquaintance in general founded only on something nothing between mr willoughby must not have ventured to mention chapter xix edward remained week at cottage be earnestly pressed by mr dashwood to stay longer a if be bent only on self mortification seemed resolved to be gone when enjoyment among friend be at height spirit during last two three day though still very unequal be greatly improvedhe grew more more partial to house environsnever spoke of going away without sighdeclared time to be wholly disengagedeven doubted to what place must go when left thembut still go must never have week passed so quicklyhe must hardly believe to be gone said so repeatedly other thing said too marked turn of feeling gave lie to action have pleasure at norland detested being in town to norland london must go valued kindness beyond thing greatest happiness be in being with yet must leave at end of week in spite of wish own without restraint on time elinor placed be astonishing in way of acting to mother account be happy for that have mother whose character be so imperfectly known to a to be general excuse for thing strange on part of son disappointed however vexed a be sometimes displeased with uncertain behaviour to herself be very well disposed on whole to regard action with candid allowance generous qualification have be rather more painfully extorted from for willoughbys service by mother want of spirit of openness of consistency be most usually attributed to want of independence better knowledge of mr ferrarss disposition design shortness of visit steadiness of purpose in leaving originated in same fettered inclination same inevitable necessity of temporizing with mother old well established grievance of duty against will parent against child be cause of must have be glad to know when difficulty be to cease opposition be to yieldwhen mr ferrars must be reformed son be at liberty to be happy from such vain wish be forced to turn for comfort to renewal of confidence in edward affection to remembrance of mark of regard in look word fell from while at barton above to flattering proof of constantly wore round finger think edward said mr dashwood a be at breakfast last morning must be happier man if have profession to engage time give interest to plan action inconvenience to friend indeed might result from ityou must not be able to give so much of time with smile must be materially benefited in one particular at leastyou must know where to go when left do assure replied that have long thought on point a think now have be be probably will always be heavy misfortune to have have necessary business to engage profession to give employment afford thing like independence unfortunately own nicety nicety of friend have made what be idle helpless being never must agree in choice of profession always preferred church a still do be not smart enough for family recommended army be great deal too smart for law be allowed to be genteel enough many young men who have chamber in temple made very good appearance in first circle drove about town in very knowing gig have inclination for law even in le abstruse study of family approved a for navy have fashion on side be too old when subject be first started to enter itand at length a there be necessity for having profession at a might be a dashing expensive without red coat on back a with one idleness be pronounced on whole to be most advantageous honourable young man of eighteen be not in general so earnestly bent on being busy a to resist solicitation of friend to hing be therefore entered at oxford have be properly idle ever since consequence of suppose will be said mr dashwood since leisure have not promoted own happiness that son will be brought up to a many pursuit employment profession trade a columella will be brought up said in serious accent to be a unlike a be possible in feeling in action in condition in thing come come be effusion of immediate want of spirit edward be in melancholy humour fancy that one unlike must be happy remember that pain of parting from friend will be felt by body at time be education state know own happiness want nothing patienceor give more fascinating name call hope mother will secure to in time that independence be so anxious for be duty will must ere long become happiness to prevent whole youth from being wasted in discontent how much may not few month do think replied edward may defy many month to produce good to desponding turn of mind though must not be communicated to mr dashwood gave additional pain to in parting shortly took place left uncomfortable impression on elinors feeling especially required trouble time to subdue a be determination to subdue to prevent from appearing to suffer more than what family suffered on going away did not adopt method so judiciously employed by marianne on similar occasion to augment fix sorrow by seeking silence solitude idleness mean be a different a object equally suited to advancement of elinor sat down to drawing table a soon a be out of house busily employed whole day sought avoided mention of name appeared to interest almost a much a ever in general concern of family if by conduct did not lessen own grief be at least prevented from unnecessary increase mother sister be spared much solicitude on account such behaviour a so exactly reverse of own appeared more meritorious to marianne than own have seemed faulty to business of self command settled very easilywith strong affection be impossible with calm one must have merit that sister affection be calm dared not deny though blushed to acknowledge of strength of own gave very striking proof by still loving respecting that sister in spite of mortifying conviction without shutting up from family leaving house in determined solitude to avoid lying awake whole night to indulge meditation elinor found day afforded leisure enough to think of edward of edward behaviour in possible variety different state of spirit at different time must producewith tenderness pity approbation censure doubt there be moment in abundance when if not by absence of mother sister at least by nature of employment conversation be forbidden among effect of solitude be produced mind be inevitably at liberty thought must not be chained elsewhere past future on subject so interesting must be before must force attention engross memory reflection fancy from reverie of kind a sat at drawing table be roused one morning soon after edward leaving by arrival of company happened to be quite alone closing of little gate at entrance of green court in front of house drew eye to window saw large party walking up to door amongst be sir john lady middleton mr jennings there be two others gentleman lady who be quite unknown to be sitting near window a soon a

hanover square must come indeed be sure will be very happy to chaperon at time till be confined if mr dashwood must not like to go into public thanked be obliged to resist entreaty oh love cried mr palmer to husband who just then entered roomyou must help to persuade miss dashwoods to go to town winter love made answer after slightly bowing to lady began complaining of weather how horrid be said such weather make thing body disgusting dullness be a much produced within door a without by rain make one detest one acquaintance what devil doe sir john mean by not having billiard room in house how few people know what comfort be sir john be a stupid a weather rest of company soon dropt in be afraid miss marianne said sir john have not be able to take usual walk to allenham today marianne looked very grave said nothing oh dont be so sly before said mr palmer for know about assure admire taste very much for think be extremely handsome live great way from in country know not above ten mile dare say much nearer thirty said husband ah well there be not much difference never be at house say be sweet pretty place a vile spot a ever saw in life said mr palmer marianne remained perfectly silent though countenance betrayed interest in what be said be very ugly continued mr palmerthen must be other place be so pretty suppose when be seated in dining room sir john observed with regret that be only eight together dear said to lady be very provoking that must be so few why did not ask gilbert to come to today did not tell sir john when spoke to about before that must not be done dined with last sir john said mr jennings must not stand upon such ceremony then must be very ill bred cried mr palmer love contradict body said wife with usual laugh do know that be quite rude did not know contradicted body in calling mother ill bred ay may abuse a please said good natured old lady have taken charlotte off hand can not give back again so there have whip hand of charlotte laughed heartily to think that husband must not get rid of exultingly said did not care how cross be to a must live together be impossible for one to be more thoroughly good natured more determined to be happy than mr palmer studied indifference insolence discontent of husband gave pain when scolded abused be highly diverted mr palmer be so droll said in whisper to elinor be always out of humour elinor be not inclined after little observation to give credit for being so genuinely unaffectedly ill natured ill bred a wished to appear temper might perhaps be little soured by finding like many others of sex that through unaccountable bias in favour of beauty be husband of very silly womanbut knew that kind of blunder be too common for sensible man to be lastingly hurt by be rather wish of distinction believed produced contemptuous treatment of body general abuse of thing before be desire of appearing superior to other people motive be too common to be wondered at mean however might succeed by establishing superiority in ill breeding be not likely to attach one to except wife oh dear miss dashwood said mr palmer soon afterwards have got favour to ask of sister will come spend time at cleveland christmas now pray doand come while weston be with can not think how happy will be will be quite delightfulmy love applying to husband dont long to have miss dashwoods come to

not like mr palmer excessively certainly said elinor seems very agreeable welli be so glad do thought must be so pleasant mr palmer be excessively pleased with sister can tell cant think how disappointed will be if dont come to clevelandi cant imagine why must object to elinor be again obliged to decline invitation by changing subject put stop to entreaty thought probable that a lived in same county mr palmer might be able to give more particular account of willoughbys general character than must be gathered from middleton partial acquaintance with be eager to gain from one confirmation of merit a might remove possibility of fear from marianne began by inquiring if saw much of mr willoughby at cleveland whether be intimately acquainted with oh dear yes know extremely well replied mr palmernot that ever spoke to indeed have seen for ever in town somehow other never happened to be staying at barton while be at allenham mama saw here once beforebut be with uncle at weymouth however dare say must have seen great deal of in somersetshire if have not happened very unluckily that must never have be in country together be very little at combe believe if be ever so

when be to take place mr brandon be very well hope oh yes quite well so full of praise did nothing say fine thing of be flattered by commendation seems excellent man think uncommonly pleasing so do be such charming man that be quite pity must be so grave so dull mama say be in love with sister too assure be great compliment if be for hardly ever fall in love with body be mr willoughby much known in part of somersetshire said elinor oh yes extremely well be believe many people be acquainted with because combe magna be so far off think extremely agreeable assure nobody be more liked than mr willoughby wherever go so may tell sister be monstrous lucky girl to get upon honour not that be much more lucky in getting because be so very handsome agreeable that nothing can be good enough for however dont think hardly at handsomer than assure for think excessively pretty so doe mr palmer too be sure though must not get to own last night mr palmer information respecting willoughby be not very material testimony in favour however small be pleasing to be so glad be got acquainted at last continued charlotteand now hope will always be great friend cant think how much longed to see be so delightful that must live at cottage nothing can be like to be sure be so glad sister be going to be well married hope will be great deal at combe magna be sweet place by account have be long acquainted with colonel brandon have not yes great while ever since sister married be particular friend of sir john believe added in low voice must have be very glad to have have if must sir john lady middleton wished very much mama did not think match good enough for otherwise sir john must have mentioned to colonel must have be married immediately did not colonel brandon know of sir john proposal to mother before be made have never owned affection to yourself oh if mama have not objected to dare say must have liked of thing have not seen then above twice for be before left school however be much happier a be mr palmer be kind of man like chapter xxi palmer returned to cleveland next day two family at barton be again left to entertain other did not last long elinor have hardly got last visitor out of head have hardly done wondering at charlotte being so happy without cause at mr palmer acting so simply with good ability at strange unsuitableness often existed between husband wife before sir john mr jenningss active zeal in cause of society procured other new acquaintance to see observe in morning excursion to exeter have met with two young lady whom mr jennings have satisfaction of discovering to be relation be enough for sir john to invite directly to park a soon a present engagement at exeter be over engagement at exeter instantly gave way before such invitation lady middleton be thrown into little alarm on return of sir john by hearing that be very soon to receive visit from two girl whom have never seen in life of whose elegancewhose tolerable gentility even must have proof for assurance of husband mother on subject went for nothing at being relation too made so much worse mr jenningss attempt at consolation be therefore unfortunately founded when advised daughter not to care about being so fashionable because be cousin must put up with one a be impossible however now to prevent coming lady middleton resigned to idea of with philosophy of well bred woman contenting with merely giving husband gentle reprimand on subject five six time day young lady arrived appearance be by mean ungenteel unfashionable dress be very smart manner very civil be delighted with house in rapture with furniture happened to be so doatingly fond of child lady middleton good opinion be engaged in favour before have be hour at park declared to be very agreeable girl indeed for ladyship be enthusiastic admiration sir john confidence in own judgment rose with animated praise set off directly for cottage to tell miss dashwoods of miss steele arrival to assure of being sweetest girl in world from such commendation a however there be not much to be learned elinor well knew that sweetest girl in world be to be met with in part of england under possible variation of form face temper understanding sir john wanted whole family to walk to park directly look at guest benevolent philanthropic man be painful to even to keep third cousin to do come now said hepray comeyou must comei declare will comeyou cant think how will like lucy be monstrous pretty so good humoured agreeable child be hanging about already a if be old acquaintance long to see of thing for have heard at exeter that be most beautiful creature in world have told be very true great deal more will be delighted with be sure have brought whole coach full of plaything for child how can be so cross a not to come why be cousin know after fashion be cousin be wife so must be related sir john must not prevail must only obtain promise of calling at park within day two then left in amazement at indifference to walk home boast anew of attraction to miss steele a have be already boasting of miss steele to when promised visit to park consequent introduction to young lady took place found in appearance of eldest who be nearly thirty with very plain not sensible face nothing to admire in other who be not more than two three twenty acknowledged considerable beauty feature be pretty have sharp quick eye smartness of air though did not give actual elegance grace gave distinction to person manner be particularly civil elinor soon allowed credit for kind of sense when saw with what constant judicious attention be making agreeable to lady middleton with child be in continual rapture extolling beauty courting notice humouring whim such of time a must be spared from importunate demand politeness made on be spent in admiration of ladyship be doing if happened to be doing thing in taking pattern of elegant new dress in appearance day before have thrown into unceasing delight fortunately for who pay court through such foible fond mother though in pursuit of praise for child most rapacious of human being be likewise most credulous demand be exorbitant will swallow thing excessive affection endurance of miss steele towards offspring be viewed therefore by lady middleton without smallest surprise distrust saw with maternal complacency impertinent encroachment mischievous trick to cousin submitted saw sash untied hair pulled about ear work bag searched knife scissors stolen away felt doubt of being reciprocal enjoyment suggested other surprise than elinor marianne must sit so composedly by without claiming share in what be passing john be in such spirit today said on taking miss steele pocket handkerchief throwing out of windowhe be full of monkey trick soon afterwards on second boy violently pinching one of same lady finger fondly observed how playful william be here be sweet little annamaria added tenderly caressing little girl of three year old who have not made noise for last two minute be always so gentle quietnever be there such quiet little thing unfortunately in bestowing embrace pin in ladyship head dress slightly scratching child neck produced from pattern of gentleness such violent scream a must hardly be outdone by creature professedly noisy mother consternation be excessive must not surpass alarm of miss steele thing be done by three in so critical emergency affection must suggest a likely to assuage agony of little sufferer be seated in mother lap covered with kiss wound bathed with lavender water by one of miss steele who be on knee to attend mouth stuffed with sugar plum by other with reward for tear child be too wise to cease cry still screamed sobbed lustily kicked two brother for offering to touch united soothings be ineffectual till lady middleton luckily remembering that in scene of similar distress last week apricot marmalade have be successfully applied for bruised temple same remedy be eagerly proposed for unfortunate scratch slight intermission of scream in young lady on hearing gave reason to hope that must not be rejected be carried out of room therefore in mother arm in quest of medicine a two boy chose to follow though earnestly entreated by mother to stay behind four young lady be left in quietness room have not known for many hour poor little creature said miss steele a soon a be gone might have be very sad accident yet hardly know how cried marianne unless have be under totally different circumstance be usual way of heightening alarm where there be nothing to be alarmed at in reality what sweet woman lady middleton be said lucy steele marianne be silent be impossible for to say what did not feel however trivial occasion upon elinor therefore whole task of telling lie when politeness required always fell did best when thus called on by speaking of lady middleton with more warmth than felt though with far le than miss lucy sir john too cried elder sister what charming man be here too miss dashwoods commendation being only simple just came in without eclat merely observed that be perfectly good humoured friendly what charming little family have never saw such fine child in lifei declare quite doat upon already indeed be always distractedly fond of child must guess so said elinor with smile from what have witnessed morning have notion said lucy think little middleton rather too much indulged perhaps may be outside of enough be so natural in lady middleton for part love to see child full of life spirit can not bear if be tame quiet confess replied elinor that while be at barton park never think of tame quiet child with abhorrence short pause succeeded speech be first broken by miss steele who seemed very much disposed for conversation who now said rather abruptly how do like devonshire miss dashwood suppose be very sorry to leave sussex in surprise at familiarity of question at least of manner in be spoken elinor replied that be norland be prodigious beautiful place be not added miss steele have heard sir john admire excessively said lucy who seemed to think apology necessary for freedom of sister think one must admire replied elinor who ever saw place though be not to be supposed that one can estimate beauty a do have great many smart beau there suppose have not so many in part of world for part think be vast addition always why must think said lucy looking ashamed of sister that there be not a many genteel young men in devonshire a sussex nay dear im sure dont pretend to say that there ant im sure there vast many smart beau in exeter know how must tell what smart beau there might be about norland be only afraid miss dashwoods might find dull at barton if have not so many a used to have perhaps young lady may not care about beau have a lief be without a with for part think be vastly agreeable provided dress smart behave civil cant bear to see dirty nasty now there mr rose at exeter prodigious smart young man beau clerk to mr simpson know yet if do meet of morning be not fit to be seen suppose brother be quite beau miss dashwood before married a be so rich upon word replied elinor can not tell for perfectly comprehend meaning of word can say that if ever be beau before married be one still for there be not smallest alteration in oh dear one never think of married men being beauxthey have something else to do lord anne cried sister can talk of nothing beauxyou will make miss dashwood believe think of nothing else then to turn discourse began admiring house furniture specimen of miss steele be enough vulgar freedom folly of eldest left recommendation a elinor be not blinded by beauty shrewd look of youngest to want of real elegance artlessness left house without wish of knowing better not so miss steele came from exeter well provided with admiration for use of sir john middleton family relation niggardly proportion be now dealt out to fair cousin whom declared to be most beautiful elegant accomplished agreeable girl have ever beheld with whom be particularly anxious to be better acquainted to be better acquainted therefore elinor soon found be inevitable lot for a sir john be entirely on side of miss steele party must be too strong for opposition that kind of intimacy must be submitted to consists of sitting hour two together in same room almost day sir john must do more did not know that more be required to be together be in opinion to be intimate while continual scheme for meeting be effectual have not doubt of being established friend to do justice did thing in power to promote unreserve by making miss steele acquainted with whatever knew supposed of cousin situation in most delicate particular elinor have not seen more than twice before eldest of wished joy on sister having be so lucky a to make conquest of very smart beau since came to barton twill be fine thing to have married so young to be sure said hear be quite beau prodigious handsome hope may have a good luck soonbut perhaps may have friend in corner already elinor must not suppose that sir john must be more nice in proclaiming suspicion of regard for edward than have be with respect to marianne indeed be rather favourite joke of two a being somewhat newer more conjectural since edward visit have never dined together without drinking to best affection with so much significancy so many nod wink a to excite general attention letter fhad be likewise invariably brought forward found productive of such countless joke that character a wittiest letter in alphabet have be long established with miss steele a expected have now benefit of joke in eldest of raised curiosity to know name of gentleman alluded to though often impertinently expressed be perfectly of piece with general inquisitiveness into concern of family sir john did not sport long with curiosity delighted to raise for have at least a much pleasure in telling name a miss steele have in hearing name be ferrars said in very audible whisper pray tell for great secret ferrars repeated miss steele mr ferrars be happy man be what sister in law brother miss dashwood very agreeable young man to be sure know very well how can say so anne cried lucy who generally made amendment to sister assertion though have seen once twice at uncle be rather too much to pretend to know very well elinor heard with attention surprise who be uncle where did live how came acquainted wished very much to have subject continued though did not chuse to join in nothing more of be said for first time in life thought mr jennings deficient either in curiosity after petty information in disposition to communicate manner in miss steele have spoken of edward increased curiosity for struck a being rather ill natured suggested suspicion of lady knowing fancying to know something to disadvantagebut curiosity be unavailing for farther notice be taken of mr ferrarss name by miss steele when alluded to even openly mentioned by sir john chapter xxii marianne who have never much toleration for thing like impertinence vulgarity inferiority of part even difference of taste from herself be at time particularly ill disposed from state of spirit to be pleased with miss steele to encourage advance to invariable coldness of behaviour towards checked endeavour at intimacy on side elinor principally attributed that preference of herself soon became evident in manner of especially of lucy who missed opportunity of engaging in conversation of striving to improve acquaintance by easy frank communication of sentiment lucy be naturally clever remark be often just amusing a companion for hour elinor frequently found agreeable power have received no aid from education be ignorant illiterate deficiency of mental improvement want of information in most common particular must not be concealed from miss dashwood in spite of constant endeavour to appear to advantage elinor saw pitied for neglect of ability education might have rendered so respectable saw with le tenderness of feeling thorough want of delicacy of rectitude integrity of mind attention assiduity flattery at park betrayed must have lasting satisfaction in company of person who joined insincerity with ignorance whose want of instruction prevented meeting in conversation on term of equality whose conduct toward others made show of attention deference towards perfectly valueless will think question odd one dare say said lucy to one day a be walking together from park to cottagebut pray be personally acquainted with sister in law mr ferrars elinor did think question very odd one countenance expressed a answered that have never seen mr ferrars indeed replied lucy wonder at for thought must have seen at norland sometimes then perhaps can not tell what sort of woman be returned elinor cautious of giving real opinion of edward mother not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity know nothing of be sure think very strange for enquiring about in such way said lucy eyeing elinor attentively a spoke perhaps there may be reasonsi wish might venture however hope will do justice of believing mean to be impertinent elinor made civil reply walked on for few minute in silence be broken by lucy who renewed subject again by saying with hesitation can not bear to have think impertinently curious be sure must rather do thing in world than be thought so by person whose good opinion be so well worth having a yours be sure must not have smallest fear of trusting indeed must be very glad of advice how to manage in such uncomfortable situation a be however there be occasion to trouble be sorry happen to know mr ferrars be sorry said elinor in great astonishment if must be of use to to know opinion of really never understood that be at connected with family therefore be little surprised confess at so serious inquiry into character dare say be be sure at wonder at if dared tell must not be so much surprised mr ferrars be certainly nothing to at presentbut time may comehow soon will come must depend upon herselfwhen may be very intimately connected looked down a said amiably bashful with only one side glance at companion to observe effect on good heaven cried elinor what do mean be acquainted with mr robert ferrars can be did not feel much delighted with idea of such sister in law replied lucy not to mr robert ferrarsi never saw in life fixing eye upon elinor to eldest brother what felt elinor at moment astonishment must have be a painful a be strong have not immediate disbelief of assertion attended turned towards lucy in silent amazement unable to divine reason object of declaration though complexion varied stood firm in incredulity felt in danger of hysterical fit swoon may well be surprised continued lucy for to be sure must have have idea of before for dare say never dropped smallest hint of to of family because be always meant to be great secret be sure have be faithfully kept so by to hour not soul of relation know of anne never must have mentioned to if have not felt greatest dependence in world upon secrecy really thought behaviour in asking so many question about mr ferrars must seem so odd that ought to be explained think mr ferrars can be displeased when know have trusted because know have highest opinion in world of family look upon other miss dashwoods quite a own sistersshe paused elinor for few moment remained silent astonishment at what heard be at first too great for word at length forcing to speak to speak cautiously said with calmness of manner tolerably well concealed surprise solicitudemay ask if engagement be of long standing have be engaged four year four year yes elinor though greatly shocked still felt unable to believe did not know said that be even acquainted till other day acquaintance however be of many year date be under uncle care know considerable while uncle yes mr pratt did never hear talk of mr pratt think have replied elinor with exertion of spirit increased with increase of emotion be four year with uncle who life at longstaple near plymouth be there acquaintance begun for sister be often staying with uncle be there engagement be formed though not till year after have quitted a pupil be almost always with afterwards be very unwilling to enter into a may imagine without knowledge approbation of mother be too young loved too well to be so prudent a ought to have be though know so well a miss dashwood must have seen enough of to be sensible be very capable of making woman sincerely attached to certainly answered elinor without knowing what said after moment reflection added with revived security of edward honour love companion falsehoodengaged to mr edward ferrarsi confess so totally surprised at what tell that reallyi beg pardon surely there must be mistake of person name can not mean same mr ferrars can mean other cried lucy smiling mr edward ferrars eldest son of mr ferrars of park street brother of sister in law mr john dashwood be person mean must allow be not likely to be deceived a to name of man on who happiness depends be strange replied elinor in most painful perplexity must never have heard even mention name considering situation be not strange first care have be to keep matter secret knew nothing of family therefore there must be occasion for ever mentioning name to a be always particularly afraid of sister suspecting thing be reason enough for not mentioning be silentelinors security sunk self command did not sink with four year have be engaged said with firm voice yes heaven know how much longer may have to wait poor edward put quite out of heart then taking small miniature from pocket added to prevent possibility of mistake be so good a to look at face doe not do justice to be sure yet think can not be deceived a to person be drew fori have have above three year put into hand a spoke when elinor saw painting other doubt fear of too hasty decision wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in mind must have none of being edward face returned almost instantly acknowledging likeness have never be able continued lucy to give picture in return be very much vexed at for have be always so anxious to get be determined to set for very first opportunity be quite in right replied elinor calmly then proceeded few pace in silence lucy spoke first be sure said have doubt in world of faithfully keeping secret because must know of what importance be to not to have reach mother for must never approve of dare say will have fortune fancy be exceeding proud woman certainly did not seek confidence said elinor do more than justice in imagining may be depended on secret be safe with pardon if surprise at so unnecessary communication must at least have felt that being acquainted with must not add to safety a said looked earnestly at lucy hoping to discover something in countenance perhaps falsehood of greatest part of what have be saying lucy countenance suffered change be afraid must think be taking great liberty with said in telling have not known long to be sure personally at least have known family by description great while a soon a saw felt almost a if be old acquaintance besides in present case really thought explanation be due to after making such particular inquiry about edward mother be so unfortunate have not creature whose advice can ask anne be only person know of have judgment at indeed doe great deal more harm than good for be in constant fear of betraying doe not know how to hold tongue a must perceive be sure be in greatest fright in world tother day when edward name be mentioned by sir john lest must out with cant think how much go through in mind from altogether only wonder that be alive after what have suffered for edward sake last four year thing in such suspense uncertainty seeing so seldomwe can hardly meet above twice year be sure wonder heart be not quite broke here took out handkerchief elinor did not feel very compassionate sometimes continued lucy after wiping eye think whether must not be better for to break off matter entirely a said looked directly at companion then at other time have not resolution enough for can not bear thought of making so miserable a know very mention of such thing must do on own account tooso dear a be to mei dont think must be equal to what must advise to do in case miss dashwood what must do pardon replied elinor startled by question can give advice under such circumstance own judgment must direct to be sure continued lucy after few minute silence on side mother must provide for sometime other poor edward be so cast down by did not think dreadful low spirited when be at barton be so miserable when left at longstaple to go to be afraid must think quite ill did come from uncle then when visited oh yes have be staying fortnight with did think came directly from town replied elinor most feelingly sensible of fresh circumstance in favour of lucy veracity remember told that have be staying fortnight with friend near plymouth remembered too own surprise at time at mentioning nothing farther of friend at total silence with respect even to name did not think sadly out of spirit repeated lucy did indeed particularly so when first arrived begged to exert for fear must suspect what be matter made so melancholy not being able to stay more than fortnight with seeing so much affected poor fellow be afraid be just same with now for writes in wretched spirit heard from just before left exeter taking letter from pocket carelessly showing direction to elinor know hand dare saya charming one be be not written so well a usual be tired dare say for have just filled sheet to a full a possible elinor saw that be hand must doubt no longer picture have allowed to believe might have be accidentally obtained might not have be edward gift correspondence between by letter must subsist only under positive engagement must be authorised by nothing else for few moment be almost overcomeher heart sunk within must hardly stand exertion be indispensably necessary struggled so resolutely against oppression of feeling that success be speedy for time complete writing to other said lucy returning letter into pocket be only comfort have in such long separation yes have one other comfort in picture poor edward have not even that if have picture say must be easy gave lock of hair set in ring when be at longstaple last be comfort to said not equal to picture perhaps might notice ring when saw did said elinor with composure of voice under be concealed emotion distress beyond thing have ever felt before be mortified shocked confounded fortunately for have now reached cottage conversation must be continued farther after sitting with few minute miss steele returned to park elinor be then at liberty to think be wretched end of first volume chapter xxiii however small elinors general dependence on lucy veracity might be be impossible for on serious reflection to suspect in present case where temptation must be answerable to folly of inventing falsehood of such description what lucy have asserted to be true therefore elinor must not dared not longer doubt supported a be too on side by such probability proof contradicted by nothing own wish opportunity of acquaintance in house of mr pratt be foundation for rest at once indisputable alarming edward visit near plymouth melancholy state of mind dissatisfaction at own prospect uncertain behaviour towards intimate knowledge of miss steele a to norland family connection have often surprised picture letter ring formed altogether such body of evidence a overcame fear of condemning unfairly established a fact partiality must set aside ill treatment of herselfher resentment of such behaviour indignation at having be dupe for short time made feel only for other idea other consideration soon arose have edward be intentionally deceiving have feigned regard for did not feel be engagement to lucy engagement of heart might once have be must not believe such at present affection be own must not be deceived in mother sister fanny have be conscious of regard for at norland be not illusion of own vanity certainly loved what softener of heart be persuasion how much must not tempt to forgive have be blamable highly blamable in remaining at norland after first felt influence over to be more than ought to be in must not be defended if have injured how much more have injured if case be pitiable be hopeless imprudence have made miserable for while seemed to have deprived of chance of ever being otherwise might in time regain tranquillity have to look forward to must ever be tolerably happy with lucy steele must be affection for out of question with integrity delicacy well informed mind be satisfied with wife like herilliterate artful selfish youthful infatuation of nineteen must naturally blind to thing beauty good nature four succeeding yearsyears if rationally spent give such improvement to understanding must have opened eye to defect of education while same period of time spent on side in inferior society more frivolous pursuit have perhaps robbed of simplicity might once have given interesting character to beauty if in supposition of seeking to marry difficulty from mother have seemed great how much greater be now likely to be when object of engagement be undoubtedly inferior in connection probably inferior in fortune to herself difficulty indeed with heart so alienated from lucy might not press very hard upon patience melancholy be state of person by whom expectation of family opposition unkindness must be felt a relief a consideration occurred to in painful succession wept for more than for herself supported by conviction of having done nothing to merit present unhappiness consoled by belief that edward have done nothing to forfeit esteem thought must even now under first smart of heavy blow command enough to guard suspicion of truth from mother sister so well be able to answer own expectation that when joined at dinner only two hour after have first suffered extinction of dearest hope one must have supposed from appearance of sister elinor be mourning in secret over obstacle must divide for ever from object of love that marianne be internally dwelling on perfection of man of whose whole heart felt thoroughly possessed whom expected to see in carriage drove near house necessity of concealing from mother marianne what have be entrusted in confidence to though obliged to unceasing exertion be aggravation of elinors distress on contrary be relief to to be spared communication of what must give such affliction to to be saved likewise from hearing condemnation of edward must probably flow from excess of partial affection for herself be more than felt equal to support from counsel conversation knew must receive assistance tenderness sorrow must add to distress while self command must neither receive encouragement from example from praise be stronger alone own good sense so well supported that firmness be a unshaken appearance of cheerfulness a invariable a with regret so poignant so fresh be possible for to be much a have suffered from first conversation with lucy on subject soon felt earnest wish of renewing for more reason than one wanted to hear many particular of engagement repeated again wanted more clearly to understand what lucy really felt for edward whether there be sincerity in declaration of tender regard for particularly wanted to convince lucy by readiness to enter on matter again calmness in conversing on that be otherwise interested in than a friend very much feared involuntary agitation in morning discourse must have left at least doubtful that lucy be disposed to be jealous of appeared very probable be plain that edward have always spoken highly in praise not merely from lucy assertion from venturing to trust on so short personal acquaintance with secret so confessedly evidently important even sir john joking intelligence must have have weight indeed while elinor remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by edward required other consideration of probability to make natural that lucy must be jealous that be so very confidence be proof what other reason for disclosure of affair must there be elinor might be informed by of lucy superior claim on edward be taught to avoid in future have little difficulty in understanding thus much of rival intention while be firmly resolved to act by a principle of honour honesty directed to combat own affection for edward to see a little a possible must not deny comfort of endeavouring to convince lucy that heart be unwounded a must now have nothing more painful to hear on subject than have already be told did not mistrust own ability of going through repetition of particular with composure be not immediately that opportunity of doing so must be commanded though lucy be a well disposed a to take advantage of occurred for weather be not often fine enough to allow of joining in walk where might most easily separate from others though met at least other evening at park cottage chiefly at former must not be supposed to meet for sake of conversation thought must never enter sir john lady middleton head therefore very little leisure be ever given for general chat none at for particular discourse met for sake of eating drinking laughing together playing at card consequence other game be sufficiently noisy one two meeting of kind have taken place without affording elinor chance of engaging lucy in private when sir john called at cottage one morning to beg in name of charity that must dine with lady middleton day a be obliged to attend club at exeter must otherwise be quite alone except mother two miss steele elinor who foresaw fairer opening for point have in view in party a be likely to be more at liberty among under tranquil well bred direction of lady middleton than when husband united together in one noisy purpose immediately accepted invitation margaret with mother permission be equally compliant marianne though always unwilling to join of party be persuaded by mother who must not bear to have seclude from chance of amusement to go likewise young lady went lady middleton be happily preserved from frightful solitude have threatened insipidity of meeting be exactly such a elinor have expected produced not one novelty of thought expression nothing must be le interesting than whole of discourse in dining parlour drawing room to latter child accompanied while remained there be too well convinced of impossibility of engaging lucy attention to attempt quitted only with removal of tea thing card table be then placed elinor began to wonder at for having ever entertained hope of finding time for conversation at park rose up in preparation for round game be glad said lady middleton to lucy be not going to finish poor little annamarias basket evening for be sure must hurt eye to work filigree by candlelight will make dear little love amends for disappointment to morrow then hope will not much mind hint be enough lucy recollected instantly replied indeed be very much mistaken lady middleton be only waiting to know whether can make party without must have be at filigree already must not disappoint little angel for world if want at card table now be resolved to finish basket after supper be very good hope wont hurt eyeswill ring bell for working candle poor little girl must be sadly disappointed know if basket be not finished tomorrow for though told certainly must not be sure depends upon having done lucy directly drew work table near reseated with alacrity cheerfulness seemed to infer that must taste greater delight than in making filigree basket for spoilt child lady middleton proposed rubber of casino to others one made objection marianne who with usual inattention to form of general civility exclaimed ladyship will have goodness to excuse meyou know detest card will go to piano forte have not touched since be tuned without farther ceremony turned away walked to instrument lady middleton looked a if thanked heaven that have never made so rude speech marianne can never keep long from instrument know maam said elinor endeavouring to smooth away offence much wonder at for be very best toned piano forte ever heard remaining five be now to draw card perhaps continued elinor if must happen to cut out may be of use to miss lucy steele in rolling paper for there be so much still to be done to basket that must be impossible think for labour singly to finish evening must like work exceedingly if must allow share in indeed will be very much obliged to for help cried lucy for find there be more to be done to than thought there be must be shocking thing to disappoint dear annamaria after oh must be terrible indeed said miss steele dear little soul how do love be very kind said lady middleton to elinor a really like work perhaps will be a well pleased not to cut in till rubber will take chance now elinor joyfully profited by first of proposal thus by little of address marianne must never condescend to practise gained own end pleased lady middleton at same time lucy made room for with ready attention two fair rival be thus seated side by side at same table with utmost harmony engaged in forwarding same work pianoforte at marianne wrapped up in own music own thought have by time forgotten that body be in room besides herself be luckily so near miss dashwood now judged might safely under shelter of noise introduce interesting subject without risk of being heard at card table chapter xxiv in firm though cautious tone elinor thus began must be undeserving of confidence have honoured with if felt desire for continuance farther curiosity on subject will not apologize therefore for bringing forward again thank cried lucy warmly for breaking ice have set heart at ease by for be somehow other afraid have offended by what told that monday offended how must suppose so believe elinor spoke with truest sincerity nothing must be farther from intention than to give idea must have motive for trust be not honourable flattering to yet do assure replied lucy little sharp eye full of meaning there seemed to to be coldness displeasure in manner that made quite uncomfortable felt sure that be angry with have be quarrelling with ever since for having took liberty a to trouble with affair be very glad to find be only own fancy that really blame if knew what consolation be to to relieve heart speaking to of what be always thinking of moment of life compassion must make overlook thing else be sure indeed can easily believe that be very great relief to to acknowledge situation to be assured that will never have reason to repent case be very unfortunate one seem to to be surrounded with difficulty will have need of mutual affection to support under mr ferrars believe be entirely dependent on mother have only two thousand pound of own must be madness to marry upon though for own part must give up prospect of more without sigh have be always used to very small income must struggle with poverty for love too well to be selfish mean of robbing perhaps of that mother might give if married to please must wait may be for many year with almost other man in world must be alarming prospect edward affection constancy nothing can deprive of know conviction must be thing to be undoubtedly supported by same trust in yours if strength of reciprocal attachment have failed a between many people under many circumstance naturally must during four year engagement situation must have be pitiable indeed lucy here looked up elinor be careful in guarding countenance from expression must give word suspicious tendency edward love for said lucy have be pretty well put to test by long very long absence since be first engaged have stood trial so well must be unpardonable to doubt now can safely say that have never gave one moment alarm on account from first elinor hardly knew whether to smile sigh at assertion lucy went on be rather of jealous temper too by nature from different situation in life from being so much more in world than continual separation be enough inclined for suspicion to have found out truth in instant if there have be slightest alteration in behaviour to when met lowness of spirit must not account for if have talked more of one lady than seemed in respect le happy at longstaple than used to be mean to say that be particularly observant quick sighted in general in such case be sure must not be deceived thought elinor be very pretty can impose upon of what said after short silence be view have none that of waiting for mr ferrarss death be melancholy shocking extremityis son determined to submit to to tediousness of many year of suspense in may involve rather than run risk of displeasure for while by owning truth if must be certain that must be only for while mr ferrars be very headstrong proud woman in first fit of anger upon hearing must very likely secure thing to robert idea of for edward sake frightens away inclination for hasty measure for own sake too be carrying disinterestedness beyond reason lucy looked at elinor again be silent do know mr robert ferrars asked elinor not at alli never saw fancy be very unlike brothersilly great coxcomb great coxcomb repeated miss steele whose ear have caught word by sudden pause in mariannes music oh be talking of favourite beau dare say sister cried lucy be mistaken there favourite beau be not great coxcomb can answer for miss dashwoods be not said mr jennings laughing heartily for be one of modestest prettiest behaved young men ever saw a for lucy be such sly little creature there be finding out who like oh cried miss steele looking significantly round at dare say lucy beau be quite a modest pretty behaved a miss dashwoods elinor blushed in spite of lucy bit lip looked angrily at sister mutual silence took place for time lucy first put end to by saying in lower tone though marianne be then giving powerful protection of very magnificent concerto will honestly tell of one scheme have lately come into head for bringing matter to bear indeed be bound to let into secret for be party concerned dare say have seen enough of edward to know that must prefer church to other profession now plan be that must take order a soon a can then through interest be sure must be kind enough to use out of friendship for hope out of regard to brother might be persuaded to give norland living understand be very good one present incumbent not likely to live great while must be enough for to marry upon might trust to time chance for rest must always be happy replied elinor to show mark of esteem friendship for mr ferrars do not perceive that interest on occasion must be perfectly unnecessary be brother to mr john dashwoodthat must be recommendation enough to husband mr john dashwood must not much approve of edward going into order then rather suspect that interest must do very little be again silent for many minute at length lucy exclaimed with deep sigh believe must be wisest way to put end to business at once by dissolving engagement seem so beset with difficulty on side that though must make miserable for time must be happier perhaps in end will not give advice miss dashwood answered elinor with smile concealed very agitated feeling on subject certainly will not know very well that opinion must have weight with unless be on side of wish indeed wrong replied lucy with great solemnity know nobody of whose judgment think so highly a do of yours do really believe that if be to say to advise by mean to put end to engagement with edward ferrars will be more for happiness of of must resolve upon doing immediately elinor blushed for insincerity of edward future wife replied compliment must effectually frighten from giving opinion on subject have formed one raise influence much too high power of dividing two people so tenderly attached be too much for indifferent person ti because be indifferent person said lucy with pique laying particular stress on word judgment might justly have such weight with if must be supposed to be biased in respect by own feeling opinion must not be worth having elinor thought wisest to make answer to lest might provoke other to unsuitable increase of ease unreserve be even partly determined never to mention subject again pause therefore of many minute duration succeeded speech lucy be still first to end will be in town winter miss dashwood said with accustomary complacency certainly not be sorry for returned other while eye brightened at information must have gave such pleasure to meet there dare say will go for to be sure brother sister will ask to come to will not be in power to accept invitation if do how unlucky be have quite depended upon meeting there anne be to go latter end of january to relation who have be wanting to visit several year only go for sake of seeing edward will be there in february otherwise london must have charm for have not spirit for be soon called to card table by conclusion of first rubber confidential discourse of two lady be therefore at end to of submitted without reluctance for nothing have be said on side to make dislike other le than have done before elinor sat down to card table with melancholy persuasion that edward be not only without affection for person who be to be wife that have not even chance of being tolerably happy in marriage sincere affection on side must have given for self interest alone must induce woman to keep man to engagement of seemed so thoroughly aware that be weary from time subject be never revived by elinor when entered on by lucy who seldom missed opportunity of introducing be particularly careful to inform confidante of happiness whenever received letter from edward be treated by former with calmness caution dismissed a soon a civility must allow for felt such conversation to be indulgence lucy did not deserve be dangerous to herself visit of miss steele at barton park be lengthened far beyond what first invitation implied favour increased must not be spared sir john must not hear of going in spite of numerous long arranged engagement in exeter in spite of absolute necessity of returning to fulfill immediately be in full force at end of week be prevailed on to stay nearly two month at park to assist in due celebration of festival requires more than ordinary share of private ball large dinner to proclaim importance chapter xxv though mr jennings be in habit of spending large portion of year at house of child friend be not without settled habitation of own since death of husband who have traded with success in le elegant part of town have resided winter in house in one of street near portman square towards home began on approach of january to turn thought thither one day abruptly very unexpectedly by asked elder miss dashwood to accompany elinor without observing varying complexion of sister animated look spoke indifference to plan immediately gave grateful absolute denial for in believed to be speaking united inclination reason alleged be determined resolution of not leaving mother at time of year mr jennings received refusal with surprise repeated invitation immediately oh lord be sure mother can spare very well do beg will favour with company for ive quite set heart upon dont fancy that will be inconvenience to for shant put at out of way for will only be sending betty by coach hope can afford that three will be able to go very well in chaise when be in town if like to go wherever do well good may always go with one of daughter be sure mother will not object to for have have such good luck in getting own child off hand that will think very fit person to have charge of if dont get one of at least well married before have done with will not be fault will speak good word for to young men may depend upon have notion said sir john miss marianne must not object to scheme if elder sister must come into be very hard indeed that must not have little pleasure because miss dashwood doe not wish so must advise two to set off for town when be tired of barton without saying word to miss dashwood about nay cried mr jennings be sure will be monstrous glad of miss mariannes company whether miss dashwood will go not only more merrier say thought must be more comfortable for to be together because if got tired of might talk to one laugh at odd way behind back one other if not of must have lord bless how do think can live poking by who have be always used till winter to have charlotte with come miss marianne let strike hand upon bargain if miss dashwood will change mind by bye why so much better thank maam sincerely thank said marianne with warmth invitation have insured gratitude for ever must give such happiness yes almost greatest happiness be capable of to be able to accept mother dearest kindest motheri feel justice of what elinor have urged if be to be made le happy le comfortable by absenceoh nothing must tempt to leave must not must not be struggle mr jennings repeated assurance that mr dashwood must spare perfectly well elinor who now understood sister saw to what indifference to almost thing else be carried by eagerness to be with willoughby again made farther direct opposition to plan merely referred to mother decision from whom however scarcely expected to receive support in endeavour to prevent visit must not approve of for marianne on own account have particular reason to avoid marianne be desirous of mother must be eager to promoteshe must not expect to influence latter to cautiousness of conduct in affair respecting have never be able to inspire with distrust dared not explain motive of own disinclination for going to london marianne fastidious a be thoroughly acquainted with mr jennings manner invariably disgusted by must overlook inconvenience of kind must disregard must be most wounding to irritable feeling in pursuit of one object be such proof so strong so full of importance of object to a elinor in spite of have passed be not prepared to witness on being informed of invitation mr dashwood persuaded that excursion must be productive of much amusement to daughter perceiving through affectionate attention to herself how much heart of marianne be in must not hear of declining offer upon account insisted on accepting directly then began to foresee with usual cheerfulness variety of advantage must accrue to from separation be delighted with plan cried be exactly what must wish margaret will be a much benefited by a yourselves when middleton be gone will go on so quietly happily together with book music will find margaret so improved when come back again have little plan of alteration for bedroom too may now be performed without inconvenience to one be very right that must go to town must have young woman of condition in life acquainted with manner amusement of london will be under care of motherly good sort of woman of whose kindness to can have doubt in probability will see brother may be fault fault of wife when consider whose son be can not bear to have so wholly estranged from other though with usual anxiety for happiness said elinor have be obviating impediment to present scheme occurred to there be still one objection in opinion can not be so easily removed mariannes countenance sunk what said mr dashwood be dear prudent elinor going to suggest what formidable obstacle be now to bring forward let hear word about expense of objection be though think very well of mr jenningss heart be not woman whose society can afford pleasure whose protection will give consequence be very true replied mother of society separately from of other people will scarcely have thing at will almost always appear in public with lady middleton if elinor be frightened away by dislike of mr jennings said marianne at least need not prevent accepting invitation have such scruple be sure must put up with unpleasantness of kind with very little effort elinor must not help smiling at display of indifference towards manner of person to whom have often have difficulty in persuading marianne to behave with tolerable politeness resolved within that if sister persisted in going must go likewise a did not think proper that marianne must be left to sole guidance of own judgment that mr jennings must be abandoned to mercy of marianne for comfort of domestic hour to determination be more easily reconciled by recollecting edward ferrars by lucy account be not to be in town before february visit without unreasonable abridgement might be previously finished will have go said mr dashwood objection be nonsensical will have much pleasure in being in london especially in being together if elinor must ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment must foresee there from variety of source must perhaps expect from improving acquaintance with sister in law family elinor have often wished for opportunity of attempting to weaken mother dependence on attachment of edward that shock might be le when whole truth be revealed now on attack though almost hopeless of success forced to begin design by saying a calmly a must like edward ferrars very much will always be glad to see a to rest of family be matter of perfect indifference to whether be ever known to not mr dashwood smiled said nothing marianne lifted up eye in astonishment elinor conjectured that might a well have held tongue after very little farther discourse be finally settled that invitation must be fully accepted mr jennings received information with great deal of joy many assurance of kindness care be matter of pleasure merely to sir john be delighted for to man whose prevailing anxiety be dread of being alone acquisition of two to number of inhabitant in london be something even lady middleton took trouble of being delighted be putting rather out of way a for miss steele especially lucy have never be so happy in life a intelligence made elinor submitted to arrangement counteracted wish with le reluctance than have expected to feel with regard to herself be now matter of unconcern whether went to town not when saw mother so thoroughly pleased with plan sister exhilarated by in look voice manner restored to usual animation elevated to more than usual gaiety must not be dissatisfied with cause must hardly allow to distrust consequence mariannes joy be almost degree beyond happiness so great be perturbation of spirit impatience to be gone unwillingness to quit mother be only restorative to calmness at moment of parting grief on score be excessive mother affliction be hardly le elinor be only one of three who seemed to consider separation a thing short of eternal departure took place in first week in january middleton be to follow in about week miss steele kept station at park be to quit only with rest of family chapter xxvi elinor must not find in carriage with mr jennings beginning journey to london under protection a guest without wondering at own situation so short have acquaintance with lady be so wholly unsuited be in age disposition so many have be objection against measure only few day before objection have with happy ardour of youth marianne mother equally shared be overcome overlooked elinor in spite of occasional doubt of willoughbys constancy must not witness rapture of delightful expectation filled whole soul beamed in eye of marianne without feeling how blank be own prospect how cheerless own state of mind in comparison how gladly must engage in solicitude of mariannes situation to have same animating object in view same possibility of hope short very short time however must now decide what willoughbys intention be in probability be already in town mariannes eagerness to be gone declared dependence on finding there elinor be resolved not only upon gaining new light a to character own observation intelligence of others must give likewise upon watching behaviour to sister with such zealous attention a to ascertain what be what meant before many meeting have taken place must result of observation be unfavourable be determined at event to open eye of sister must be otherwise exertion must be of different natureshe must then learn to avoid selfish comparison banish regret might lessen satisfaction in happiness of marianne be three day on journey mariannes behaviour a travelled be happy specimen of what future complaisance companionableness to mr jennings might be expected to be sat in silence almost way wrapt in own meditation scarcely ever voluntarily speaking except when object of picturesque beauty within view drew from exclamation of delight exclusively addressed to sister to atone for conduct therefore elinor took immediate possession of post of civility have assigned behaved with greatest attention to mr jennings talked with laughed with listened to whenever must mr jennings on side treated with possible kindness be solicitous on occasion for ease enjoyment only disturbed that must not make choose own dinner at inn extort confession of preferring salmon

in few moment marianne did same be writing home marianne said elinor have not better defer letter for day two be not going to write to mother replied marianne hastily a if wishing to avoid farther inquiry elinor said more immediately struck that must then be writing to willoughby conclusion a instantly followed be that however mysteriously might wish to conduct affair must be engaged conviction though not entirely satisfactory gave pleasure continued letter with greater alacrity mariannes be finished in very few minute in length must be no more than note be then folded up sealed directed with eager rapidity elinor thought must distinguish large w in direction sooner be complete than marianne ringing bell requested footman who answered to get that letter conveyed for to two penny post decided matter at once spirit still continued very high there be flutter in prevented giving much pleasure to sister agitation increased a evening drew on must scarcely eat dinner when afterwards returned to drawing room seemed anxiously listening to sound of carriage be great satisfaction to elinor mr jennings by being much engaged in own room must see little of what be passing tea thing be brought in already have marianne be disappointed more than once by rap at neighbouring door when loud one be suddenly heard must not be mistaken for one at other house elinor felt secure of announcing willoughbys approach marianne starting up moved towards door thing be silent must not be borne many second opened door advanced few step towards stair after listening minute returned into room in agitation conviction of having heard must naturally produce in ecstasy of feeling at instant must not help exclaiming elinor be willoughby indeed be seemed almost ready to throw into arm when colonel brandon appeared be too great shock to be borne with calmness immediately left room elinor be disappointed too at same time regard for colonel brandon ensured welcome with felt particularly hurt that man so partial to sister must perceive that experienced nothing grief disappointment in seeing instantly saw that be not unnoticed by that even observed marianne a quitted room with such astonishment concern a hardly left recollection of what civility demanded towards be sister ill said elinor answered in distress that be then talked of head ache low spirit over fatigue of thing to must decently

actually before from interested occupied others restless dissatisfied where sister must never obtain opinion of article of purchase however might equally concern received pleasure from anything be only impatient to be at home again must with difficulty govern vexation at tediousness of mr palmer whose eye be caught by thing pretty expensive new who be wild to buy must determine on none dawdled away time in rapture indecision be late in morning before returned home sooner have entered house than marianne flew eagerly up stair when elinor followed found turning from table with sorrowful countenance declared that willoughby have be there have letter be left here for since went out said to footman who then entered with parcel be answered in negative be quite sure of replied be certain that servant porter have left letter note man replied that none have how very odd said in low disappointed voice a turned away to window how odd indeed repeated elinor within regarding sister with uneasiness if have not known to be in town must not have written to a did must have written to combe magna if be in town how odd that must come write oh dear mother must be wrong in permitting engagement between daughter so young man so little known to be carried on in so doubtful so mysterious manner long to inquire how will interference be borne determined after consideration that if appearance continued many day longer a unpleasant a now be must represent in strongest manner to mother necessity of serious enquiry into affair mr palmer two elderly lady of mr jenningss intimate acquaintance whom have met invited in morning dined with former left soon after tea to fulfill evening engagement elinor be obliged to assist in making whist table for others marianne be of use on occasion a must never learn game though time be therefore at own disposal evening be by mean more productive of pleasure to than to elinor for be spent in anxiety of expectation pain of disappointment sometimes endeavoured for few minute to read book be soon thrown aside returned to more interesting employment of walking backwards forward across room pausing for moment whenever came to window in hope of distinguishing long expected rap chapter xxvii if open weather hold much longer said mr jennings when met at breakfast following morning sir john will not like leaving barton next week ti sad thing for sportsman to lose day pleasure poor soul always pity when do seem to take so much to heart be true cried marianne in cheerful voice walking to window a spoke to examine day have not thought of that weather will keep many sportsman in country be lucky recollection good spirit be restored by be charming weather for indeed continued a sat down to breakfast table with happy countenance how much must enjoy with little return of anxiety can not be expected to last long at time of year after such series of rain will certainly have very little more of frost will soon set in in probability with severity in day two perhaps extreme mildness can hardly last longernay perhaps may freeze tonight at rate said elinor wishing to prevent mr jennings from seeing sister thought a clearly a did dare say will have sir john lady middleton in town by end of next week ay dear ill warrant do mary always have own way now silently conjectured elinor will write to combe by day post if did letter be written sent away with privacy eluded watchfulness to ascertain fact whatever truth of might be far a elinor be from feeling thorough contentment about yet while saw marianne in spirit must not be very uncomfortable herself marianne be in spirit happy in mildness of weather still happier in expectation of frost morning be chiefly spent in leaving card at house of mr jenningss acquaintance to inform of being in town marianne be time busy in observing direction of wind watching variation of sky imagining alteration in air dont find colder than be in morning elinor there seems to very decided difference can hardly keep hand warm even in muff be not so yesterday think cloud seem parting too sun will be out in moment will have clear afternoon elinor be alternately diverted pained marianne persevered saw night in brightness of fire morning in appearance of atmosphere certain symptom of approaching frost miss dashwoods have greater reason to be dissatisfied with mr jenningss style of living set of acquaintance than with behaviour to be invariably kind thing in household arrangement be conducted on most liberal plan excepting few old city friend whom to lady middleton regret have never dropped visited one to whom introduction must at discompose feeling of young companion pleased to find more comfortably situated in particular than have expected elinor be very willing to compound for want of much real enjoyment from of evening party whether at home abroad formed only for card must have little to amuse colonel brandon who have general invitation to house be with almost day came to look at marianne talk to elinor who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with than from other daily occurrence who saw at same time with much concern continued regard for sister feared be strengthening regard grieved to see earnestness with often watched marianne spirit be certainly worse than when at barton about week after arrival became certain that willoughby be also arrived card be on table when came in from morning drive good god cried marianne have be here while be out elinor rejoiced to be assured of being in london now ventured to say depend upon will call again tomorrow marianne seemed hardly to hear on mr jenningss entrance escaped with precious card event while raised spirit of elinor restored to of sister more than former agitation from moment mind be never quiet expectation of seeing hour of day made unfit for thing insisted on being left behind next morning when others went out elinors thought be full of what might be passing in berkeley street during absence moment glance at sister when returned be enough to inform that willoughby have paid no second visit there note be just then brought in laid on table for cried marianne stepping hastily forward maam for mistress marianne not convinced took instantly up be indeed for mr jennings how provoking be expecting letter then said elinor unable to be longer silent yes littlenot much after short pause have confidence in marianne nay elinor reproach from youyou who have confidence in one returned elinor in confusion indeed marianne have nothing to tell answered marianne with energy situation then be alike have of thing to tell because communicate because conceal nothing elinor distressed by charge of reserve in herself be not at liberty to do away knew not how under such circumstance to press for greater openness in marianne mr jennings soon appeared note being given read aloud be from lady middleton announcing arrival in conduit street night before requesting company of mother cousin following evening business on sir john part violent cold on own prevented calling in berkeley street invitation be accepted when hour of appointment drew near necessary a be in common civility to mr jennings that must attend on visit elinor have difficulty in persuading sister to go for still have seen nothing of willoughby therefore be not more indisposed for amusement abroad than unwilling to run risk of calling again in absence elinor found when evening be over disposition be not materially altered by change of abode for although scarcely settled in town sir john have contrived to collect around nearly twenty young people to amuse with ball be affair however of lady middleton did not approve in country unpremeditated dance be very allowable in london where reputation of elegance be more important le easily attained be risking too much for gratification of few girl to have known that lady middleton have given small dance of eight nine couple with two violin mere side board collation mr mr palmer be of party from former whom have not seen before since arrival in town a be careful to avoid appearance of attention to mother in law therefore never came near received mark of recognition on entrance looked at slightly without seeming to know who be merely nodded to mr jennings from other side of room marianne gave one glance round apartment a entered be enoughhe be not thereand sat down equally ill disposed to receive communicate pleasure after have be assembled about hour mr palmer sauntered towards miss dashwoods to express surprise on seeing in town though colonel brandon have be first informed of arrival at house have said something very droll on hearing that be to come thought be in devonshire said did replied elinor when do go back again know thus ended discourse never have marianne be so unwilling to dance in life a be that evening never so much fatigued by exercise complained of a returned to berkeley street aye aye said mr jennings know reason of very well if certain person who will be nameless have be there must not have be bit tired to say truth be not very pretty of not to give meeting when be invited invited cried marianne so daughter middleton told for seems sir john met somewhere in street morning marianne said more looked exceedingly hurt impatient in situation to be doing something might lead to sister relief elinor resolved to write next morning to mother hoped by awakening fear for health of marianne to procure inquiry have be so long delayed be still more eagerly bent on measure by perceiving after breakfast on morrow that marianne be again writing to willoughby for must not suppose to be to other person about middle of day mr jennings went out by on business elinor began letter directly while marianne too restless for employment too anxious for conversation walked from one window to other sat down by fire in melancholy meditation elinor be very earnest in application to mother relating have passed suspicion of willoughbys inconstancy urging by plea of duty affection to demand from marianne account of real situation with respect to letter be scarcely finished when rap foretold visitor colonel brandon be announced marianne who have seen from window who hated company of kind left room before entered looked more than usually grave though expressing satisfaction at finding miss dashwood alone a if have somewhat in particular to tell sat for time without saying word elinor persuaded that have communication to make in sister be concerned impatiently expected opening be not first time of feeling same kind of conviction for more than once before beginning with observation of sister look unwell to day sister seems out of spirit have appeared on point of disclosing of inquiring something particular about after pause of several minute silence be broken by asking in voice of agitation when be to congratulate on acquisition of brother elinor be not prepared for such question having answer ready be obliged to adopt simple common expedient of asking what meant tried to smile a replied sister engagement to mr willoughby be very generally known can not be generally known returned elinor for own family know looked surprised said beg pardon be afraid inquiry have be impertinent have not supposed secrecy intended a openly correspond marriage be universally talked of how can that be by whom can have heard mentioned by manyby of whom know nothing by others with whom be most intimate mr jennings mr palmer middleton still might not have believed for where mind be perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced will always find something to support doubt if have not when servant let in today accidentally seen letter in hand directed to mr willoughby in sister writing came to inquire be convinced before must ask question be thing finally settled be impossible to have right must have chance of succeeding excuse miss dashwood believe have be wrong in saying so much hardly know what to do on prudence have strongest dependence tell that be absolutely resolved on attempt that in short concealment if concealment be possible be remains word conveyed to elinor direct avowal of love for sister affected very much be not immediately able to say anything even when spirit be recovered debated for short time on answer must be most proper to give real state of thing between willoughby sister be so little known to herself that in endeavouring to explain might be a liable to say too much a too little yet a be convinced that mariannes affection for willoughby must leave hope of colonel brandons success whatever event of affection might be at same time wished to shield conduct from censure thought most prudent kind after consideration to say more than really knew believed acknowledged therefore that though have never be informed by of term on stood with other of mutual affection have doubt of correspondence be not astonished to hear listened to with silent attention on ceasing to speak rose directly from seat after saying in voice of emotion to sister wish imaginable happiness to willoughby that may endeavour to deserve hertook leave went away elinor derived comfortable feeling from conversation to lessen uneasiness of mind on other point be left on contrary with melancholy impression of colonel brandons unhappiness be prevented even from wishing removed by anxiety for very event that must confirm chapter xxviii nothing occurred during next three four day to make elinor regret what have done in applying to mother for willoughby came wrote be engaged about end of time to attend lady middleton to party from mr jennings be kept away by indisposition of youngest daughter for party marianne wholly dispirited careless of appearance seeming equally indifferent whether went staid prepared without one look of hope one expression of pleasure sat by drawing room fire after tea till moment of lady middleton arrival without once stirring from seat altering attitude lost in own thought insensible of sister presence when at last be told that lady middleton waited for at door started a if have forgotten that one be expected arrived in due time at place of destination a soon a string of carriage before must allow alighted ascended stair heard name announced from one landing place to in audible voice entered room splendidly lit up quite full of company insufferably hot when have paid tribute of politeness by curtsying to lady of house be permitted to mingle in crowd take share of heat inconvenience to arrival must necessarily add after time spent in saying little doing le lady middleton sat down to cassino a marianne be not in spirit for moving about elinor luckily succeeding to chair placed at great distance from table have not remained in manner long before elinor perceived willoughby standing within few yard of in earnest conversation with very fashionable looking young woman soon caught eye immediately bowed without attempting to speak to to approach marianne though must not see then continued discourse with same lady elinor turned involuntarily to marianne to see whether must be unobserved by at moment first perceived whole countenance glowing with sudden delight must have moved towards instantly have not sister caught hold of good heaven exclaimed be therehe be thereoh why doe not look at why can not speak to pray pray be composed cried elinor betray what feel to body present perhaps have not observed yet however be more than must believe to be composed at moment be not only beyond reach of marianne be beyond wish sat in agony of impatience affected feature at last turned round again regarded started up pronouncing name in tone of affection held out hand to approached addressing rather to elinor than marianne a if wishing to avoid eye determined not to observe attitude inquired in hurried manner after mr dashwood asked how long have be in town elinor be robbed of presence of mind by such address be unable to say word feeling of sister be instantly expressed face be crimsoned over exclaimed in voice of greatest emotion good god willoughby what be meaning of have not received letter will not shake hand with must not then avoid touch seemed painful to held hand only for moment during time be evidently struggling for composure elinor watched countenance saw expression becoming more tranquil after moment pause spoke with calmness did honour of calling in berkeley street last tuesday very much regretted be not fortunate enough to find yourselves mr jennings at home card be not lost hope have not received note cried marianne in wildest anxiety here be mistake be suresome dreadful mistake what can be meaning of tell willoughby for heaven sake tell be matter made reply complexion changed embarrassment returned a if on catching eye of young lady with whom have be previously talking felt necessity of instant exertion recovered again after saying yes have pleasure of receiving information of arrival in town be so good a to send turned hastily away with slight bow joined friend marianne now looking dreadfully white unable to stand sunk into chair elinor expecting moment to see faint tried to screen from observation of others while reviving with lavender water go to elinor cried a soon a must speak force to come to tell must see againmust speak to instantlyi can not resti will not have moment peace till be explainedsome dreadful misapprehension other oh go to moment how can that be done dearest marianne must wait be not place for explanation wait only till tomorrow with difficulty however must prevent from following to persuade to check agitation to wait at least with appearance of composure till might speak to with more privacy more effect be impossible for marianne continued incessantly to give way in low voice to misery of feeling by exclamation of wretchedness in short time elinor saw willoughby quit room by door towards staircase telling marianne that be gone urged impossibility of speaking to again that evening a fresh argument for to be calm instantly begged sister must entreat lady middleton to take home a be too miserable to stay minute longer lady middleton though in middle of rubber on being informed that marianne be unwell be too polite to object for moment to wish of going away making over card to friend departed a soon a carriage must be found scarcely word be spoken during return to berkeley street marianne be in silent agony too much oppressed even for tear a mr jennings be luckily not come home must go directly to own room where hartshorn restored little to herself be soon undressed in bed a seemed desirous of being alone sister then left while waited return of mr jennings have leisure enough for thinking over past that kind of engagement have subsisted between willoughby marianne must not doubt that willoughby be weary of seemed equally clear for however marianne might still feed own wish must not attribute such behaviour to mistake misapprehension of kind nothing thorough change of sentiment must account for indignation must have be still stronger than be have not witnessed that embarrassment seemed to speak consciousness of own misconduct prevented from believing so unprincipled a to have be sporting with affection of sister from first without design must bear investigation absence might have weakened regard convenience might have determined to overcome that regard have formerly existed must not bring to doubt a for marianne on pang so unhappy meeting must already have given on still more severe might await in probable consequence must not reflect without deepest concern own situation gained in comparison for while must esteem edward a much a ever however might be divided in future mind might be always supported circumstance must embitter evil seemed uniting to heighten misery of marianne in final separation from willoughbyin immediate irreconcilable rupture with chapter xxix before housemaid have lit fire next day sun gained power over cold gloomy morning in january marianne only half dressed be kneeling against one of window seat for sake of little light must command from writing a fast a continual flow of tear must permit in situation elinor roused from sleep by agitation sob first perceived after observing for few moment with silent anxiety said in tone of most considerate gentleness marianne may ask elinor replied ask nothing will soon know sort of desperate calmness with be said lasted no longer than while spoke be immediately followed by return of same excessive affliction be minute before must go on with letter frequent burst of grief still obliged at interval to withhold pen be proof enough of feeling how more than probable be that be writing for last time to willoughby elinor paid quiet unobtrusive attention in power must have tried to sooth tranquilize still more have not marianne entreated with eagerness of most nervous irritability not to speak to for world in such circumstance be better for that must not be long together restless state of mariannes mind not only prevented from remaining in room moment after be dressed requiring at once solitude continual change of place made wander about house till breakfast time avoiding sight of body at breakfast ate attempted to eat thing elinors attention be then employed not in urging not in pitying in appearing to regard in endeavouring to engage mr jenningss notice entirely to herself a be favourite meal with mr jennings lasted considerable time be just setting after round common working table when letter be delivered to marianne eagerly caught from servant turning of death like paleness instantly ran out of room elinor who saw a plainly by a if have seen direction that must come from willoughby felt immediately such sickness at heart a made hardly able to hold up head sat in such general tremour a made fear impossible to escape mr jenningss notice good lady however saw only that marianne have received letter from willoughby appeared to very good joke treated accordingly by hoping with laugh that must find to liking of elinors distress be too busily employed in measuring length of worsted for rug to see thing at calmly continuing talk a soon a marianne disappeared said upon word never saw young woman so desperately in love in life girl be nothing to yet used to be foolish enough a for miss marianne be quite altered creature hope from bottom of heart wont keep waiting much longer for be quite grievous to see look so ill forlorn pray when be to be married elinor though never le disposed to speak than at moment obliged to answer attack a therefore trying to smile replied have really maam talked into persuasion of sister being engaged to mr willoughby thought have be only joke so serious question seems to imply more must beg therefore will not deceive longer do assure that nothing must surprise more than to hear of being going to be married for shame for shame miss dashwood how can talk so dont know that must be match that be over head ear in love with other from first moment met did not see together in devonshire day day long did not know that sister came to town with on purpose to buy wedding clothes come come wont do because be so sly about think nobody else have sens be such thing can tell for have be known over town ever so long tell body of so doe charlotte indeed maam said elinor very seriously be mistaken indeed be doing very unkind thing in spreading report will find that have though will not believe now mr jennings laughed again elinor have not spirit to say more eager at event to know what willoughby have written hurried away to room where on opening door saw marianne stretched on bed almost choked by grief one letter in hand two three others lying by elinor drew near without saying word seating on bed took hand kissed affectionately several time then gave way to burst of tear at first be scarcely le violent than mariannes latter though unable to speak seemed to feel tenderness of behaviour after time thus spent in joint affliction put letter into elinors hand then covering face with handkerchief almost screamed with agony elinor who knew that such grief shocking a be to witness must have course watched by till excess of suffering have somewhat spent then turning eagerly to willoughbys letter read a follows bond street january dear madam have just have honour of receiving letter for beg to return sincere acknowledgment be much concerned to find there be anything in behaviour last night did not meet approbation though be quite at loss to discover in what point must be so unfortunate a to offend entreat forgiveness of what can assure to have be perfectly unintentional will never reflect on former acquaintance with family in devonshire without most grateful pleasure flatter will not be broken by mistake misapprehension of action esteem for whole family be very sincere if have be so unfortunate a to give rise to belief of more than felt meant to express will reproach for not having be more guarded in profession of esteem must ever have meant more will allow to be impossible when understand that affection have be long engaged elsewhere will not be many week believe before engagement be fulfilled be with great regret that obey command in returning letter with have be honoured from lock of hair so obligingly bestowed on be dear madam most obedient humble servant john willoughby with what indignation letter a must be read by miss dashwood may be imagined though aware before began that must bring confession of inconstancy confirm separation for ever be not aware that such language must be suffered to announce must have supposed willoughby capable of departing so far from appearance of honourable delicate feelingso far from common decorum of gentleman a to send letter so impudently cruel letter instead of bringing with desire of release profession of regret acknowledged breach of faith denied peculiar affection whatevera letter of line be insult proclaimed writer to be deep in hardened villainy paused over for time with indignant astonishment then read again again perusal only served to increase abhorrence of man so bitter be feeling against that dared not trust to speak lest might wound marianne still deeper by treating disengagement not a loss to of possible good a escape from worst most irremediable of evil connection for life with unprincipled man a deliverance most real blessing most important in earnest meditation on content of letter on depravity of mind must dictate probably on very different mind of very different person who have other connection with affair than what heart gave with thing passed elinor forgot immediate distress of sister forgot that have three letter on lap yet unread so entirely forgot how long have be in room when on hearing carriage drive up to door went to window to see who must be coming so unreasonably early be astonishment to perceive mr jenningss chariot knew have not be ordered till one determined not to quit marianne though hopeless of contributing at present to ease hurried away to excuse from attending mr jennings on account of sister being indisposed mr jennings with thoroughly good humoured concern for cause admitted excuse most readily elinor after seeing safe off returned to marianne whom found attempting to rise from bed whom reached just in time to prevent from falling on floor faint giddy from long want of proper rest food for be many day since have appetite many night since have really slept now when mind be no longer supported by fever of suspense consequence of be felt in aching head weakened stomach general nervous faintness glass of wine elinor procured for directly made more comfortable be at last able to express sense of kindness by saying poor elinor how unhappy make only wish replied sister there be thing must do might be of comfort to a thing else must have be be too much for marianne who must only exclaim in anguish of heart oh elinor be miserable indeed before voice be entirely lost in sob elinor must no longer witness torrent of unresisted grief in silence exert dear marianne cried if must not kill who love think of mother think of misery while suffer for sake must exert can not can not cried marianne leave leave if distress leave hate forget torture so oh how easy for who have sorrow of own to talk of exertion happy happy elinor can not have idea of what suffer do call happy marianne ah if knewand can believe to be so while see so wretched forgive forgive throwing arm round sister neck know feel for know what heart have yet

walking thoughtfully from fire to window from window to fire without knowing that received warmth from one discerning object through other marianne seated at foot of bed with head leaning against one of post again took up willoughbys letter after shuddering over sentence exclaimed be too much oh willoughby willoughby must be yours cruel cruelnothing can acquit elinor nothing can whatever might

willoughby be unfathomable where did hear in stationer shop in pall mall where have business two lady be waiting for carriage one of be giving other account of intended match in voice so little attempting concealment that be impossible for not to hear name of willoughby john willoughby frequently repeated first caught attention what followed be positive assertion thing be now finally settled respecting marriage with miss greyit be no longer to be secretit must take place even within few week with many particular of preparation other matter one thing especially remember because served to

in shop till be gone be mr ellison that a have be since informed be name of miss grey guardian be have likewise heard that miss grey have fifty thousand pound in if in thing may find explanation may be so willoughby be capableat least thinkhe stopped moment then added in voice seemed to distrust sisterhow did suffering have be very severe have only to hope that may be proportionately short have be be most cruel affliction till yesterday believe never doubted regard even now perhapsbut be almost convinced that never be really attached to have be very deceitful in point there seems hardness of heart about ah said colonel brandon there be indeed sister doe noti think said soshe doe not consider quite a do know disposition may believe how eagerly must still justify if must made answer soon afterwards by removal of tea thing arrangement of card party subject be necessarily dropped mr jennings who have watched with pleasure while be talking who expected to see effect of miss dashwoods communication in such instantaneous gaiety on colonel brandons side a might have become man in bloom of youth of hope happiness saw with amazement remain whole evening more serious thoughtful than usual chapter xxxi from night of more sleep than have expected marianne awoke next morning to same consciousness of misery in have closed eye elinor encouraged a much a possible to talk of what felt before breakfast be ready have gone through subject again again with same steady conviction affectionate counsel on elinors side same impetuous feeling varying opinion on mariannes a before sometimes must believe willoughby to be a unfortunate a innocent a herself at others lost consolation in impossibility of acquitting at one moment be absolutely indifferent to observation of world at must seclude from for ever at third must resist with energy in one thing however be uniform when came to point in avoiding where be possible presence of mr jennings in determined silence when obliged to endure heart be hardened against belief of mr jenningss entering into sorrow with compassion can not be cried can not feel kindness be not sympathy good nature be not tenderness that want be gossip only like now because supply elinor have not needed to be assured of injustice to sister be often led in opinion of others by irritable refinement of own mind too great importance placed by on delicacy of strong sensibility grace of polished manner like rest of world if more than half there be be clever good marianne with excellent ability excellent disposition be reasonable candid expected from other people same opinion feeling a own judged of motif by immediate effect of action on thus circumstance occurred while sister be together in own room after breakfast sunk heart of mr jennings still lower in estimation because through own weakness chanced to prove source of fresh pain to herself though mr jennings be governed in by impulse of utmost goodwill with letter in outstretched hand countenance gaily smiling from persuasion of bringing comfort entered room saying now dear bring something be sure will do good marianne heard enough in one moment imagination placed before letter from willoughby full of tenderness contrition explanatory of have passed satisfactory convincing instantly followed by willoughby rushing eagerly into room to inforce at foot by eloquence of eye assurance of letter work of one moment be destroyed by next hand writing of mother never till then unwelcome be before in acuteness of disappointment followed ecstasy of more than hope felt a if till instant have never suffered cruelty of mr jennings language within reach in moment of happiest eloquence must have expressed now must reproach only by tear streamed from eye with passionate violencea reproach however so entirely lost on object that after many expression of pity withdrew still referring to letter of comfort letter when be calm enough to read brought little comfort willoughby filled page mother still confident of engagement relying a warmly a ever on constancy have only be roused by elinors application to intreat from marianne greater openness towards with such tenderness towards such affection for willoughby conviction of future happiness in other that wept with agony through whole of impatience to be at home again now returned mother be dearer to than ever dearer through very excess of mistaken confidence in willoughby be wildly urgent to be gone elinor unable herself to determine whether be better for marianne to be in london at barton offered counsel of own except of patience till mother wish must be known at length obtained sister consent to wait for knowledge mr jennings left earlier than usual for must not be easy till middleton palmer be able to grieve a much a herself positively refusing elinors offered attendance went out alone for rest of morning elinor with very heavy heart aware of pain be going to communicate perceiving by mariannes letter how ill have succeeded in laying foundation for then sat down to write mother account of what have passed entreat direction for future while marianne who came into drawing room on mr jenningss going away remained fixed at table where elinor wrote watching advancement of pen grieving over for hardship of such task grieving still more fondly over effect on mother in manner have continued about quarter of hour when marianne whose nerve must not then bear sudden noise be startled by rap at door who can be cried so early too thought have be safe marianne moved to window be colonel brandon said with vexation be never safe from will not come in a mr jennings be from home will not trust to retreating to own room man who have nothing to do with own time have conscience in intrusion on of others event proved conjecture right though be founded on injustice error for colonel brandon did come in elinor who be convinced that solicitude for marianne brought thither who saw solicitude in disturbed melancholy look in anxious though brief inquiry after must not forgive sister for esteeming so lightly met mr jennings in bond street said after first salutation encouraged to come on be more easily encouraged because thought probable might find alone be very desirous of doing objectmy wishmy sole wish in desiring iti hope believe isi to be mean of giving comfortno must not say comfortnot present

dissipated worse than knowing a have now known many week guess what must have felt on seeing sister a fond of a ever on being assured that be to marry guess what must have felt for sake when came to last week found alone came determined to know truth though irresolute what to do when be known behaviour must have seemed strange to then now will comprehend to suffer to be so deceived to see sisterbut what must do have hope of interfering with success sometimes thought sister influence might yet reclaim now after such dishonorable usage who can tell what be design on whatever may have be however may now hereafter doubtless will turn with gratitude towards own condition when compare with of poor eliza when considers wretched hopeless situation of poor girl picture to herself with affection for so strong still a strong a own with mind tormented by self reproach must attend through life surely comparison must have use with will feel own suffering to be nothing proceed from

communicating to what have told must know best what will be effect have not seriously from heart believed might be of service might lessen regret must not have suffered to trouble with account of family affliction with recital may seem to have be intended to raise at expense of others elinors thanks followed speech with grateful earnestness attended too with assurance of expecting material advantage to marianne from communication of what have passed have be more pained said by endeavor to acquit than by rest for irritates mind more than most perfect conviction of unworthiness can do now though at first will suffer much be sure will soon become easier have continued after short silence ever seen mr willoughby since left at barton yes replied gravely once have one meeting be unavoidable elinor startled by manner looked at anxiously saying what have met to must meet other way eliza have confessed to though most reluctantly name of lover when returned to town be within fortnight after met by appointment to defend to punish conduct returned unwounded meeting therefore never got abroad elinor sighed over fancied necessity of to man soldier presumed not to censure such said colonel brandon after pause have be unhappy resemblance between fate of mother daughter so imperfectly have discharged trust be still in town no a soon a recovered from lying in for found near delivery removed child into country there remains recollecting soon afterwards that be probably dividing elinor from sister put end to visit receiving from again same grateful acknowledgment leaving full of compassion esteem for chapter xxxii when particular of conversation be repeated by miss dashwood to sister a very soon be effect on be not entirely such a former have hoped to see not that marianne appeared to distrust truth of part of for listened to with most steady submissive attention made objection remark attempted vindication of willoughby seemed to show by tear that felt to be impossible though behaviour assured that conviction of guilt be carried home to mind though saw with satisfaction effect of in no longer avoiding colonel brandon when called in speaking to even voluntarily speaking with kind of compassionate respect though saw spirit le violently irritated than before did not see le wretched mind did become settled be settled in gloomy dejection felt loss of willoughbys character yet more heavily than have felt loss of heart seduction desertion of miss williams misery of poor girl doubt of what design might once have be on preyed altogether so much on spirit that must not bring to speak of what felt even to elinor brooding over sorrow in silence gave more pain to sister than must have be communicated by most open most frequent confession of to give feeling language of mr dashwood on receiving answering elinors letter must be only to give repetition of what daughter have already felt said of disappointment hardly le painful than mariannes indignation even greater than elinors long letter from quickly succeeding other arrived to tell that suffered thought to express anxious solicitude for marianne entreat must bear up with fortitude under misfortune bad indeed must nature of mariannes affliction be when mother must talk of fortitude mortifying humiliating must be origin of regret must wish not to indulge against interest of own individual comfort mr dashwood have determined that must be better for marianne to be where at time than at barton where thing within view must be bringing back past in strongest most afflicting manner by constantly placing willoughby before such a have always seen there recommended to daughter therefore by mean not to shorten visit to mr jennings length of though never exactly fixed have be expected by to comprise at least five six week variety of occupation of object of company must not be procured at barton must be inevitable there might yet hoped cheat marianne at time into interest beyond even into amusement much a idea of might now be spurned by from danger of seeing willoughby again mother considered to be at least equally safe in town a in country since acquaintance must now be dropped by who called friend design must never bring in others way negligence must never leave exposed to surprise chance have le in favour in crowd of london than even in retirement of barton where might force before while paying that visit at allenham on marriage mr dashwood from foreseeing at first a probable event have brought to expect a certain one have yet reason for wishing child to remain where be letter from son in law have told that wife be to be in town before middle of february judged right that must sometimes see brother marianne have promised to be guided by mother opinion submitted to therefore without opposition though proved perfectly different from what wished expected though felt to be entirely wrong formed on mistaken ground that by requiring longer continuance in london deprived of only possible alleviation of wretchedness personal sympathy of mother doomed to such society such scene a must prevent ever knowing moment rest be matter of great consolation to that what brought evil to herself must bring good to sister elinor on other hand suspecting that must not be in power to avoid edward entirely comforted herself by thinking that though longer stay must therefore militate against own happiness must be better for marianne than immediate return into devonshire carefulness in guarding sister from ever hearing willoughbys name mentioned be not thrown away marianne though without knowing reaped advantage for mr jennings sir john even mr palmer ever spoke of before elinor wished that same forbearance must have extended towards be impossible

at what coachmakers new carriage be building by what painter mr willoughbys portrait be drawn at what warehouse miss grey clothes might be seen calm polite unconcern of lady middleton on occasion be happy relief to elinors spirit oppressed a often be by clamorous kindness of others be great comfort to to be sure of exciting interest in one person at least among circle of friend great comfort to know that there be one who must meet without feeling curiosity after particular anxiety for sister health qualification be raised at time by circumstance of moment to more than real value be sometimes worried down by officious condolence to rate good breeding a more indispensable to comfort than good nature lady middleton expressed sense of affair about once day twice if subject occurred very often by saying be very shocking indeed by mean of continual though gentle vent be able not only to see miss dashwoods from first without smallest emotion very soon to see without recollecting word of matter having thus supported dignity of own sex spoken decided censure of what be wrong in other thought at liberty to attend to interest of own assembly therefore determined though rather against opinion of sir john that a mr willoughby must at once be woman of elegance fortune to leave card with a soon a married colonel brandons delicate unobtrusive enquiry be never unwelcome to miss dashwood have abundantly earned privilege of intimate discussion of sister disappointment by friendly zeal with have endeavoured to soften always conversed with confidence chief reward for painful exertion of disclosing past sorrow present humiliation be given in pitying eye with marianne sometimes observed gentleness of voice whenever though did not often happen be obliged must oblige to speak to assured that exertion have produced increase of good will towards gave elinor hope of being farther augmented hereafter mr jennings who knew nothing of who knew only that colonel continued a grave a ever that must neither prevail on to make offer commission to make for began at end of two day to think that instead of midsummer must not be married till michaelmas by end of week that must not be match at good understanding between colonel miss dashwood seemed rather to declare that honour of mulberry tree canal yew arbour must all be made over to mr jennings have for time ceased to think at of mr

be saved trouble of checking by lucy sharp reprimand now a on many occasion though did not give much sweetness to manner of one sister be of advantage in governing of other chapter xxxiii after opposition marianne yielded to sister entreaty consented to go out with mr jennings one morning for hour expressly conditioned however for paying visit must do more than accompany to gray in sackville

mean like observed narrowly be convinced of be amount of fortune believe about two thousand year two thousand year then working up to pitch of enthusiastic generosity added elinor wish with heart be twice a much for sake indeed believe replied elinor be very sure that colonel brandon have not smallest wish of marrying be mistaken elinor be very much mistaken very little trouble on side secures perhaps just at present may be undecided smallness of fortune may make hang back friend may advise against of little attention encouragement lady can so easily give will fix in spite of there can be reason why must not try for be not to be supposed that prior attachment on sidein short know a to attachment of kind be quite out of question objection be insurmountableyou have too much sense not to see colonel brandon must be man civility will be wanting on part to make pleased with family be match must give universal satisfaction in short be kind of thing thatlowering voice to important whisperwill be exceedingly welcome to party recollecting however added that be mean to sayyour friend be truly anxious to see well settled fanny particularly for have interest very much at heart assure mother too mr ferrars very good natured woman be sure must give great pleasure said a much other day elinor must not vouchsafe answer must be something remarkable now continued something droll if fanny must have brother sister settling at same time yet be not very unlikely be mr edward ferrars said elinor with resolution going to be married be not actually settled there be such thing in agitation have most excellent mother mr ferrars with utmost liberality will come forward settle on thousand year if match take place lady be hon miss morton only daughter of late lord morton with thirty thousand pound very desirable connection on side have not doubt of taking place in time thousand year be great deal for mother to give away to make over for ever mr ferrars have noble spirit to give instance of liberalitythe other day a soon a came to town aware that money must not be very plenty with just now put bank note into fanny hand to amount of two hundred pound extremely acceptable be for must live at great expense while be here paused for assent compassion forced to say expense in town country must certainly be considerable income be large one not so large dare say a many people suppose mean to complain however be undoubtedly comfortable one hope will in time be better enclosure of norland common now carrying on be most serious drain then have made little purchase within half year east kingham farm must remember place where old gibson used to live land be so very desirable for in respect so immediately adjoining own property felt duty to buy must not have answered to conscience to let fall into other hand man must pay for convenience have cost vast deal of money more than think really intrinsically worth why hope not that might have sold again next day for more than gave with regard to purchase money might have be very unfortunate indeed for stock be at time so low that if have not happened to have necessary sum in banker hand must have sold out to very great loss elinor must only smile other great inevitable expense too have have on first coming to norland respected father a well know bequeathed stanhill effect remained at norland very valuable be to mother far be from to repine at doing so have undoubted right to dispose of own property a chose in consequence of have be obliged to make large purchase of linen china c to supply place of what be taken away may guess after expense how very far must be from being rich how acceptable mr ferrarss kindness be certainly said elinor assisted by liberality hope may yet live to be in easy circumstance year two may do much towards gravely replied however there be still great deal to be done there be not stone laid of fanny green house nothing plan of flower garden marked out where be green house to be upon knoll behind house old walnut tree be come down to make room for will be very fine object from many part of park flower garden will slope down just before be exceedingly pretty have cleared away old thorn grew in patch over brow elinor kept concern censure to herself be very thankful that marianne be not present to share provocation having now said enough to make poverty clear to do away necessity of buying pair of ear ring for of sister in next visit at gray thought took cheerfuller turn began to congratulate elinor on having such friend a mr jennings seems most valuable woman indeed house style of living bespeak exceeding good income be acquaintance have not only be of great use to hitherto in end may prove materially advantageous inviting to town be certainly vast thing in favour indeed speaks altogether so great regard for that in probability when dy will not be forgotten must have great deal to leave nothing at must rather suppose for have only jointure will descend to child be not to be imagined that life up to income few people of common prudence will do save will be able to dispose of do not think more likely that must leave to daughter than to daughter be exceedingly well married therefore can not perceive necessity of remembering farther whereas in opinion by taking so much notice of treating in kind of way have given sort of claim on future consideration conscientious woman must not disregard nothing can be kinder than behaviour can hardly do without being aware of expectation raise raise none in most concerned indeed brother anxiety for welfare prosperity carry too far why to be sure said seeming to recollect people have little have very little in power dear elinor what be matter with marianneshe look very unwell have lost colour be grown quite thin be ill be not well have have nervous complaint on for several week be sorry for at time of life thing of illness destroys bloom for ever hers have be very short one be a handsome girl last september a ever saw a likely to attract man there be something in style of beauty to please particularly remember fanny used to say that must marry sooner better than did not what be exceedingly fond of so happened to strike will be mistaken however question whether marianne now will marry man worth more than five six hundred year at utmost be very much deceived if do better dorsetshire know very little of dorsetshire dear elinor will be exceedingly glad to know more of think can answer for having fanny among earliest best pleased of visitor elinor tried very seriously to convince that there be likelihood of marrying colonel brandon be expectation of too much pleasure to to be relinquished be really resolved on seeking intimacy with gentleman promoting marriage by possible attention have just compunction enough for having done nothing for sister to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else must do great deal offer from colonel brandon legacy from mr jennings be easiest mean of atoning for own neglect be lucky enough to find lady middleton at home sir john came in before visit ended abundance of civility passed on side sir john be ready to like anybody though mr dashwood did not seem to know much about horse soon set down a very good natured fellow while lady middleton saw enough of fashion in appearance to think acquaintance worth having mr dashwood went away delighted with will have charming account to carry to fanny said a walked back with sister lady middleton be really most elegant woman woman a be sure fanny will be glad to know mr jennings too exceedingly well behaved woman though not so elegant a daughter sister need not have scruple even of visiting to say truth have be little case very naturally for only knew that mr jennings be widow of man who have got money in low way fanny mr ferrars be strongly prepossessed that daughter be such kind of woman a fanny must like to associate with now can carry most satisfactory account of chapter xxxiv mr john dashwood have so much confidence in husband judgment that waited very next day on mr jennings daughter confidence be rewarded by finding even former even woman with whom sister be staying by mean unworthy notice a for lady middleton found one of most charming woman in world lady middleton be equally pleased with mr dashwood there be kind of cold hearted selfishness on side mutually attracted sympathised with other in insipid propriety of demeanor general want of understanding same manner however recommended mr john dashwood to good opinion of lady middleton did not suit fancy of mr jennings to appeared nothing more than little proud looking woman of uncordial address who met husband sister without affection almost without having anything to say to for of quarter of hour bestowed on berkeley street sat at least seven minute half in silence elinor wanted very much to know though did not chuse to ask whether edward be then in town nothing must have induced fanny voluntarily to mention name before till able to tell that marriage with miss morton be resolved on till husband expectation on colonel brandon be answered because believed still so very much attached to other that must not be too sedulously divided in word deed on occasion intelligence however must not give soon flowed from quarter lucy came very shortly to claim elinors compassion on being unable to see edward though have arrived in town with mr mr dashwood dared not come to bartlett building for fear of detection though mutual impatience to meet be not to be told must hing at present write edward assured of being in town within very short time by twice calling in berkeley street twice be card found on table when returned from morning engagement elinor be pleased that have called still more pleased that have missed dashwoods be so prodigiously delighted with middleton though not much in habit of giving anything determined to give thema dinner soon after acquaintance began invited to dine in harley street where have taken very good house for three month sister mr jennings be invited likewise john dashwood be careful to secure colonel brandon who always glad to be where miss dashwoods be received eager civility with surprise much more pleasure be to meet mr ferrars elinor must not learn whether son be to be of party expectation of seeing however be enough to make interested in engagement for though must now meet edward without strong anxiety have once promised to attend such introduction though must now see with perfect indifference a to opinion of desire of being in company with mr ferrars curiosity to know what be like be a lively a ever interest with thus anticipated party be soon afterwards increased more powerfully than pleasantly by hearing that miss steele be also to be at so well have recommended to lady middleton so agreeable have assiduity made to that though lucy be certainly not so elegant sister not even genteel be a ready a sir john to ask to spend week two in conduit street happened to be particularly convenient to miss steele a soon a dashwoods invitation be known that visit must begin few day before party took place claim to notice of mr john dashwood a niece of gentleman who for many year have have care of brother might not have done much however towards procuring seat at table a lady middleton guest must be welcome lucy who have long wanted to be personally known to family to have nearer view of character own difficulty to have opportunity of endeavouring to please have seldom be happier in life than be on receiving mr john dashwoods card on elinor effect be very different began immediately to determine edward who lived with mother must be asked a mother be to party given by sister to see for first time after passed in company of lucyshe hardly knew how must bear apprehension perhaps be not founded entirely on reason certainly not at on truth be relieved however not by own recollection by good will of lucy who believed to be inflicting severe disappointment when told that edward certainly must not be in harley street on tuesday even hoped to be carrying pain still farther by persuading that be kept away by extreme affection for herself must not conceal when be together important tuesday came be to introduce two young lady to formidable mother in law pity dear miss dashwood said lucy a walked up stair togetherfor middleton arrived so directly after mr jennings that followed servant at same timethere be nobody here can feel for declare can hardly stand good gracious in moment will see person that happiness depends onthat be to be mother elinor must have given immediate relief by suggesting possibility of being miss morton mother rather than own whom be about to behold instead of doing that assured with great sincerity that did pity herto utter amazement of lucy who though really uncomfortable hoped at least to be object of irrepressible envy to elinor mr ferrars be little thin woman upright even to formality in figure serious even to sourness in aspect complexion be sallow feature small without beauty naturally without expression lucky contraction of brow have rescued countenance from disgrace of insipidity by giving strong character of pride ill nature be not woman of many word for unlike people in general proportioned to number of idea of few syllable did escape not one fell to share of miss dashwood whom eyed with spirited determination of disliking at event elinor must not now be made unhappy by behaviour few month ago must have hurt exceedingly be not in mr ferrars power to distress by now difference of manner to miss steele difference seemed purposely made to humble more only amused must not smile to see graciousness of mother daughter towards very personfor lucy be particularly distinguishedwhom of others have known a much a did must have be most anxious to mortify while who have comparatively power to wound sat pointedly slighted by while smiled at graciousness so misapplied must not reflect on mean spirited folly from sprung observe studied attention with miss steele courted continuance without thoroughly despising four lucy be exultation on being so honorably distinguished miss steele wanted only to be teazed about dr davy to be perfectly happy dinner be grand one servant be numerous thing bespoke mistress inclination for show master ability to support in spite of improvement addition be making to norland estate in spite of owner having once be within thousand pound of being obliged to sell out at loss nothing gave symptom of indigence have tried to infer from itno poverty of kind except of conversation appearedbut there deficiency be considerable john dashwood have not much to say for be worth hearing wife have still le there be peculiar disgrace in for be very much case with chief of visitor who almost laboured under one other of disqualification for being agreeablewant of sense natural improvedwant of elegancewant of spiritsor want of temper when lady withdrew to drawing room after dinner poverty be particularly evident for gentleman have supplied discourse with varietythe variety of politics inclosing land breaking horsesbut then be over one subject only engaged lady till coffee came in be comparative height of harry dashwood lady middleton second son william who be nearly of same age have child be there affair might have be determined too easily by measuring at once a harry only be present be conjectural assertion on side body have right to be equally positive in opinion to repeat over over again a often a liked party stood thus two mother though really convinced that own son be tallest politely decided in favour of other two grandmother with not le partiality more sincerity be equally earnest in support of own descendant lucy who be hardly le anxious to please one parent than other thought boy be remarkably tall for age must not conceive that there must be smallest difference in world between miss steele with yet greater address gave a fast a must in favour of elinor having once delivered opinion on williams side by offended mr ferrars fanny still more did not see necessity of enforcing by farther assertion marianne when called on for hers offended by declaring that have opinion to give a have never thought about before removing from norland elinor have painted very pretty pair of screen for sister in law being now just mounted brought home ornamented present drawing room screen catching eye of john dashwood on following other gentleman into room be officiously handed by to colonel brandon for admiration be done by eldest sister said a man of taste will dare say be pleased with know whether have ever happened to see of performance before be in general reckoned to draw extremely well colonel though disclaiming pretension to connoisseurship warmly admired screen a must have done thing painted by miss dashwood on curiosity of others being of course excited be handed round for general inspection mr ferrars not aware of being elinors work particularly requested to look at after have received gratifying testimony of lady middleton approbation fanny presented to mother considerately informing at same time that be done by miss dashwood humsaid mr ferrarsvery prettyand without regarding at returned to daughter perhaps fanny thought for moment that mother have be quite rude enoughfor colouring little immediately said be very pretty maamant then again dread of having be too civil too encouraging probably came over for presently added do not think be something in miss morton style of painting maamshe doe paint most delightfullyhow beautifully last landscape be done beautifully indeed doe thing well marianne must not bear thisshe be already greatly displeased with mr ferrars such ill timed praise of at elinors expense though have not notion of what be principally meant by provoked immediately to say with warmth be admiration of very particular kindwhat be miss morton to uswho know who care for herit be elinor of whom think speak so saying took screen out of sister in law hand to admire a ought to be admired mr ferrars looked exceedingly angry drawing up more stiffly than ever pronounced in retort bitter philippic miss morton be lord morton daughter fanny looked very angry too husband be in fright at sister audacity elinor be much more hurt by mariannes warmth than have be by what produced colonel brandons eye a be fixed on marianne declared that noticed only what be amiable in affectionate heart must not bear to see sister slighted in smallest point mariannes feeling did not stop here cold insolence of mr ferrarss general behaviour to sister seemed to to foretell such difficulty distress to elinor a own wounded heart taught to think of with horror urged by strong impulse of affectionate sensibility moved after moment to sister chair putting one arm round neck one cheek close to hers said in low eager voice dear dear elinor dont mind dont let make unhappy must say no more spirit be quite overcome hiding face on elinors shoulder burst into tear body attention be called almost body be concernedcolonel brandon rose up went to without knowing what didmrs jennings with very intelligent ah poor dear immediately gave salt sir john felt so desperately enraged against author of nervous distress that instantly changed seat to one close by lucy steele gave in whisper brief account of whole shocking affair in few minute however marianne be recovered enough to put end to bustle sit down among rest though spirit retained impression of what have passed whole evening poor marianne said brother to colonel brandon in low voice a soon a must secure attention have not such good health a sistershe be very nervousshe have not elinors constitutionand one must allow that there be something very trying to young woman who have be beauty in loss of personal attraction must not think perhaps marianne be remarkably handsome few month ago quite a handsome a elinor now see be gone chapter xxxv elinors curiosity to see mr ferrars be satisfied have found in thing must tend to make farther connection between family undesirable have seen enough of pride meanness determined prejudice against to comprehend difficulty must have perplexed engagement retarded marriage of edward have be otherwise free have seen almost enough to be thankful for own sake one greater obstacle preserved from suffering under other of mr ferrarss creation preserved from dependence upon caprice solicitude for good opinion at least if did not bring quite to rejoice in edward being fettered to lucy determined that have be more amiable ought to have rejoiced wondered that lucy spirit must be so very much elevated by civility of mr ferrarsthat interest vanity must so very much blind a to make attention seemed only paid because be not elinor appear compliment to herselfor to allow to derive encouragement from preference only given because real situation be unknown that be so have not only be declared by lucy eye at time be declared over again next morning more openly for at particular desire lady middleton set down in berkeley street on chance of seeing elinor alone to tell how happy be chance proved lucky one for message from mr palmer soon after arrived carried mr jennings away dear friend cried a soon a be by come to talk to of happiness must anything be so flattering a mr ferrarss way of treating yesterday so exceeding affable a be know how dreaded thought of seeing very moment be introduced there be such affability in behaviour a really must seem to say have quite took fancy to now be not so saw be not quite struck with be certainly very civil to civildid see nothing only civilityi saw vast deal more such kindness a fell to share of nobody meno pride hauteur sister just sameall sweetness affability elinor wished to talk of something else lucy still pressed to own that have reason for happiness elinor be obliged to go on undoubtedly if have known engagement said nothing must be more flattering than treatment of youbut a be not case guessed must say soreplied lucy quicklybut there be reason in world why mr ferrars must seem to like if did not liking be thing shant talk out of satisfaction be sure will end well there will be difficulty at to what used to think mr ferrars be charming woman so be sister be delightful woman indeedi wonder must never hear say how agreeable mr dashwood be to elinor have answer to make did not attempt be ill miss dashwoodyou seem lowyou dont speaksure ant well never be in better health be glad of with heart really did not look must be sorry to have ill have be greatest comfort to in worldheaven know what must have done without friendship elinor tried to make civil answer though doubting own success seemed to satisfy lucy for directly replied indeed be perfectly convinced of regard for next to edward love be greatest comfort have poor edward now there be one good thing will be able to meet meet pretty often for lady middleton delighted with mr dashwood so will be good deal in harley street dare say edward spends time with sisterbesides lady middleton mr ferrars will visit nowand mr ferrars sister be so good to say more than once must always be glad to see be such charming womeni be sure if ever tell sister what think of can not speak too high elinor must not give encouragement to hope that must tell sister lucy continued be sure must have seen in moment if mr ferrars have took dislike to if have only made formal courtesy for instance without saying word never after have took notice of never looked at in pleasant wayyou know what meanif have be treated in forbidding sort of way must have gave up in despair must not have stood for where doe dislike know be most violent elinor be prevented from making reply to civil triumph by door being thrown open servant announcing mr ferrars edward immediately walking in be very awkward moment countenance of showed that be so looked exceedingly foolish edward seemed to have a great inclination to walk out of room again a to advance farther into very circumstance in unpleasantest form must have be most anxious to avoid have fallen on themthey be not only all three together be together without relief of other person lady recovered first be not lucy business to put forward appearance of secrecy must still be kept up must therefore only look tenderness after slightly addressing said more elinor have more to do so anxious be for sake own to do well that forced after moment recollection to welcome with look manner be almost easy almost open struggle effort still improved must not allow presence of lucy consciousness of injustice towards to deter from saying that be happy to see that have very much regretted being from home when called before in berkeley street must not be frightened from paying attention a friend almost relation be due by observant eye of lucy though soon perceived to be narrowly watching manner gave re assurance to edward have courage enough to sit down embarrassment still exceeded that of lady in proportion case rendered reasonable though sex might make rare for heart have not indifference of lucy must conscience have ease of elinors lucy with demure settled air seemed determined to make contribution to comfort of others must not say word almost thing be said proceeded from elinor who be obliged to volunteer information about mother health coming to town c edward ought to have inquired about never did exertion did not stop here for soon afterwards felt so heroically disposed a to determine under pretence of fetching marianne to leave others by really did that in handsomest manner for loitered away several minute on landing place with most high minded fortitude before went to sister when be once done however be time for rapture of edward to cease for mariannes joy hurried into drawing room immediately pleasure in seeing be like other of feeling strong in strongly spoken met with hand must be taken voice expressed affection of sister dear edward cried be moment of great happinessthis must almost make amends for thing edward tried to return kindness a deserved before such witness dared not say half what really felt again sat down for moment two be silent while marianne be looking with most speaking tenderness sometimes at edward sometimes at elinor regretting only that delight in other must be checked by lucy unwelcome presence edward be first to speak be to notice mariannes altered look express fear of not finding london agree with oh dont think of replied with spirited earnestness though eye be filled with tear a spoke dont think of health elinor be well see must be enough for remark be not calculated to make edward elinor more easy to conciliate good will of lucy who looked up at marianne with very benignant expression do like london said edward willing to say thing might introduce subject not at all expected much pleasure in have found none sight of edward be only comfort have afforded thank heaven be what always be pausedno one spoke think elinor presently added must employ edward to take care of in return to barton in week two suppose will be going trust edward will not be very unwilling to accept charge poor edward muttered something what be nobody knew not even marianne who saw agitation must easily trace to whatever cause best pleased be perfectly satisfied soon talked of something else spent such day edward in harley street yesterday so dull so wretchedly dullbut have much to say to on head can not be said now with admirable discretion did defer assurance of finding mutual relative more disagreeable than ever of being particularly disgusted with mother till be more in private why be not there edwardwhy did not come be engaged elsewhere engaged what be when such friend be to be met perhaps miss marianne cried lucy eager to take revenge on think young men never stand upon engagement if have mind to keep little a well a great elinor be very angry marianne seemed entirely insensible of sting for calmly replied not so indeed for seriously speaking be very sure that conscience only kept edward from harley street really believe have most delicate conscience in world most scrupulous in performing engagement however minute however may make against interest pleasure be most fearful of giving pain of wounding expectation most incapable of being selfish of body ever saw edward be so will say be never to hear praisedthen must be friend of mine for who will accept of love esteem must submit to open commendation nature of commendation in present case however happened to be particularly ill suited to feeling of two third of auditor be so very unexhilarating to edward that very soon got up to go away going so soon said marianne dear edward must not be drawing little aside whispered persuasion that lucy must not stay much longer even encouragement failed for must go lucy who must have outstaid have visit lasted two hour soon afterwards went away what can bring here so often said marianne on leaving must not see that wanted gonehow teazing to edward why sowe be friend lucy have be longest known to of be natural that must like to see a well a ourselves marianne looked at steadily said know elinor that be kind of talking can not bear if only hope to have assertion contradicted a must suppose to be case ought to recollect be last person in world to do can not descend to be tricked out of assurance be not really wanted then left room elinor dared not follow to say more for bound a be by promise of secrecy to lucy must give information must convince marianne painful a consequence of still continuing in error might be be obliged to submit to that must hope be that edward must not often expose to distress of hearing mariannes mistaken warmth to repetition of other part of pain have attended recent meetingand have reason to expect chapter xxxvi within few day after meeting newspaper announced to world that lady of thomas palmer esq be safely delivered of son heir very interesting satisfactory paragraph at least to intimate connection who knew before event highly important to mr jenningss happiness produced temporary alteration in disposal of time influenced in like degree engagement of young friend for a wished to be a much a possible with charlotte went thither morning a soon a be dressed did not return till late in evening miss dashwoods at particular request of middleton spent whole of day in conduit street for own comfort must much rather have remained at least morning in mr jenningss house be not thing to be urged against wish of everybody hour be therefore made over to lady middleton two miss steele by whom company in fact be a little valued a be professedly sought have too much sense to be desirable companion to former by latter be considered with jealous eye a intruding on ground sharing kindness wanted to monopolize though nothing must be more polite than lady middleton behaviour to elinor marianne did not really like at because flattered child must not believe good natured because be fond of reading fancied satirical perhaps without exactly knowing what be to be satirical did not signify be censure in common use easily given presence be restraint on on lucy checked idleness of one business of other lady middleton be ashamed of doing nothing before flattery lucy be proud to think of administer at other time feared must despise for offering miss steele be least discomposed of three by presence be in power to reconcile to entirely must either of only have given full minute account of whole affair between marianne mr willoughby must have thought amply rewarded for sacrifice of best place by fire after dinner arrival occasioned conciliation be not granted for though often threw out expression of pity for sister to elinor more than once dropt reflection on inconstancy of beau before marianne effect be produced look of indifference from former of disgust in latter effort even yet lighter might have made friend must only have laughed at about doctor so little be more than others inclined to oblige that if sir john dined from home might spend whole day without hearing other raillery on subject than what be kind enough to bestow on jealousy discontent however be so totally unsuspected by mr jennings that thought delightful thing for girl to be together generally congratulated young friend night on having escaped company of stupid old woman so long joined sometimes at sir john sometimes at own house wherever be always came in excellent spirit full of delight importance attributing charlotte well doing to own care ready to give so exact so minute detail of situation a only miss steele have curiosity enough to desire one thing did disturb of made daily complaint mr palmer maintained common unfatherly opinion among sex of infant being alike though must plainly perceive at different time most striking resemblance between baby one of relation on side there be convincing father of persuading to believe that be not exactly like other baby of same age must even be brought to acknowledge simple proposition of being finest child in world come now to relation of misfortune about time befell mr john dashwood so happened that while two sister with mr jennings be first calling on in harley street of acquaintance have dropt ina circumstance in not apparently likely to produce evil to while imagination of other people will carry away to form wrong judgment of conduct to decide on by slight appearance one happiness must in measure be always at mercy of chance in present instance last arrived lady allowed fancy to so far outrun truth probability that on merely hearing name of miss dashwoods understanding to be mr dashwoods sister immediately concluded to be staying in harley street misconstruction produced within day two afterwards card of invitation for a well a for brother sister to small musical party at house consequence of be that mr john dashwood be obliged to submit not only to exceedingly great inconvenience of sending carriage for miss dashwoods what be still worse must be subject to unpleasantness of appearing to treat with attention who must tell that might not expect to go out with second time power of disappointing be true must always be hers be not enough for when people be determined on mode of conduct know to be wrong feel injured by expectation of thing better from marianne have now be brought by degree so much into habit of going out day that be become matter of indifference to whether went not prepared quietly mechanically for evening engagement though without expecting smallest amusement from very often without knowing till last moment where be to take to dress appearance be grown so perfectly indifferent a not to bestow consideration on during whole of toilet received from miss steele in first five minute of being together when be finished nothing escaped minute observation general curiosity saw thing asked thing be never easy till knew price of part of mariannes dress must have guessed number of gown altogether with better judgment than marianne be not without hope of finding out before parted how much washing cost per week how much have year to spend upon impertinence of kind of scrutiny be generally concluded with compliment though meant a douceur be considered by marianne a greatest impertinence of for after undergoing examination into value make of gown colour of shoe arrangement of hair be almost sure of being told that upon word looked vastly smart dared to say must make great many conquest with such encouragement a be dismissed on present occasion to brother carriage be ready to enter five minute after stopped at door punctuality not very agreeable to sister in law who have preceded to house of acquaintance be there hoping for delay on part might inconvenience coachman event of evening be not very remarkable party like other musical party comprehended great many people who have real taste for performance great many more who have none at performer be a usual in own estimation that of immediate friend first private performer in england a

one of excursive glance perceived among group of young men very who have given lecture on toothpick case at gray perceived soon afterwards looking at speaking familiarly to brother have just determined to find out name from latter when came towards mr dashwood introduced to a mr robert ferrars addressed with easy civility twisted head into bow assured a plainly a word must have done that be exactly coxcomb have heard described to be by lucy happy have be for if regard for edward have depended le on own merit than on merit of nearest relation for then brother bow must have given finishing stroke to what ill humour of mother sister must have begun while wondered at difference of two young men did not find that emptiness conceit of one put out of charity with modesty worth of other why be different robert explained to in course of quarter of hour conversation for talking of brother lamenting extreme gaucherie really believed kept from mixing in proper society candidly generously attributed much le to natural deficiency than to misfortune of private education while though probably without particular material superiority by nature merely from advantage of public school be a well fitted to mix in world a other man upon soul added believe be nothing more so often tell mother when be grieving about dear madam always say to must make easy evil be now irremediable have be entirely own doing why must be persuaded by uncle sir robert against own judgment to place edward under private tuition at most critical time of life if have only sent to westminster a well a instead of sending to mr pratts must have be prevented be way in always consider matter mother be perfectly convinced of error elinor must not oppose opinion because might be general estimation of advantage of public school must not think of edward abode in mr pratts family with satisfaction reside in devonshire thinkwas next observation in cottage near dawlish elinor set right a to situation seemed rather surprising to that anybody must live in devonshire without living near dawlish bestowed hearty approbation however on specie of house for own part said be excessively fond of cottage

thus resettled in berkeley street mr jennings on returning from ordinary visit to mr palmer entered drawing room where elinor be sitting by with air of such hurrying importance a prepared to hear something wonderful giving time only to form idea began directly to justify by saying lord dear miss dashwood have heard news maam what be something so strange will hear when got to mr palmer found charlotte quite in fuss about child be sure be very illit cried fretted be over pimple so looked at directly lord dear say be nothing in world red gum nurse said just same charlotte must not be satisfied so mr donavan be sent for luckily happened to just come in from harley street so stepped over directly a soon a ever saw child said just a did that be nothing in world red gum then charlotte be easy so just a be going away again came into head be sure know how happened to think of came into head to ask if there be news so upon that smirked simpered looked grave seemed to know something other at last said in whisper for fear unpleasant report must reach young lady under care a to sister indisposition think advisable to say that believe there be great reason for alarm hope mr dashwood will do very well what be fanny ill be exactly what said dear lord say be mr dashwood ill so then came out long short of matter by can learn seems to be mr edward ferrars very young man used to joke with about however a turn out be monstrous glad there be never thing in mr edward ferrars seems have be engaged above twelvemonth to cousin lucytheres for dear not creature knowing syllable of matter except nancy must have believed thing possible there be great wonder in liking one that matter must be brought so forward between nobody suspect be strange never happened to see together be sure must have found out directly well so be kept great secret for fear of mr ferrars brother sister suspected word of matter till very morning poor nancy who know be well meaning creature conjurer popt out lord think to be so fond of lucy to be sure will make difficulty about so away went to sister who be sitting alone at carpet work little suspecting what be to comefor have just be saying to brother only five minute before thought to make match between edward lord daughter other forget who so may think what blow be to vanity pride fell into violent hysteric immediately with such scream a reached brother ear a be sitting in own dressing room down stair thinking about writing letter to steward in country so up flew directly terrible scene took place for lucy be come to by time little dreaming what be going on poor soul pity must say think be used very hardly for sister scolded like fury soon drove into fainting fit nancy fell upon knee cried bitterly brother walked about room said did not know what to do mr dashwood declared must not stay minute longer in house brother be forced to go down upon knee too to persuade to let stay till have packed up clothes then fell into hysteric again be so frightened that must send for mr donavan mr donavan found house in uproar carriage be at door ready to take poor cousin away be just stepping in a came off poor lucy in such condition say must hardly walk nancy be almost a bad declare have patience with sister hope with heart will be match in spite of lord what taking poor mr edward will be in when hears of to have love used so scornfully for say be monstrous fond of a well may must not wonder if be to be in greatest passionand mr donavan think just same have great deal of talk about best of be that be gone back again to harley street that may be within call when mr ferrars be told of for be sent for a soon a ever cousin left house for sister be sure must be in hysteric too so may for what care have pity for of have notion of people making such to do about money greatness there be reason on earth why mr edward lucy must not marry for be sure mr ferrars may afford to do very well by son though lucy have next to nothing know better than body how to make most of thing dare say if mr ferrars must only allow five hundred year must make a good appearance with a body else must with eight lord how snug might live in such cottage a yoursor little biggerwith two maid two men believe must help to housemaid for betty have sister out of place must fit exactly here mr jennings ceased a elinor have have time enough to collect thought be able to give such answer make such observation a subject might naturally be supposed to produce happy to find that be not suspected of extraordinary interest in that mr jennings a have of late often hoped might be case have ceased to imagine at attached to edward happy above rest in absence of marianne felt very well able to speak of affair without embarrassment to give judgment a believed with impartiality on conduct of one concerned in must hardly determine what own expectation of event really be though earnestly tried to drive away notion of being possible to end otherwise at last than in marriage of edward lucy what mr ferrars must say do though there must not be doubt of nature be anxious to hear still more anxious to know how edward must conduct for felt much compassionfor lucy very littleand cost pain to procure littlefor rest of party none at a mr jennings must talk on other subject elinor soon saw necessity of preparing marianne for discussion time be to be lost in undeceiving in making acquainted with real truth in endeavouring to bring to hear talked of by others without betraying that felt uneasiness for sister resentment against edward elinors office be painful oneshe be going to remove what really believed to be sister chief consolationto give such particular of edward a feared must ruin for ever in good opinion to make marianne by resemblance in situation to fancy must seem strong feel own disappointment over again unwelcome a such task must be be necessary to be done elinor therefore hastened to perform be very far from wishing to dwell on own feeling to represent a suffering much otherwise than a self command have practised since first knowledge of edward engagement might suggest hint of what be practicable to marianne narration be clear simple though must not be given without emotion be not accompanied by violent agitation impetuous grief belonged rather to hearer for marianne listened with horror cried excessively elinor be to be comforter of others in own distress le than in theirs comfort must be given by assurance of own composure of mind very earnest vindication of edward from charge of imprudence be readily offered marianne for time must give credit to edward seemed second willoughby acknowledging a elinor did that have loved most sincerely must feel le than a for lucy steele considered so totally unamiable so absolutely incapable of attaching sensible man that must not be persuaded at first to believe afterwards to pardon former affection of edward for must not even admit to have be natural elinor left to be convinced that be so by only must convince better knowledge of mankind first communication have reached no farther than to state fact of engagement length of time have existedmariannes feeling have then broken in put end to regularity of detail for time must be done be to soothe distress lessen alarm combat resentment first question on side led to farther particular be how long have be known to elinor have written to have known four month when lucy first came to barton park last november told in confidence of engagement at word mariannes eye expressed astonishment lip must not utter after pause of wonder exclaimed four monthshave known of four month elinor confirmed what while attending in misery have be on heart have reproached for being happy be not fit that must then know how much be reverse four month cried marianne again so calm so cheerful how have be supported by feeling be doing dutymy promise to lucy obliged to be secret owed to therefore to avoid giving hint of truth owed to family friend not to create in solicitude about must not be in power to satisfy marianne seemed much struck have very often wished to undeceive mother added elinor once twice have attempted itbut without betraying trust never must have convinced four month yet loved yes did not love only while comfort of others be dear to be glad to spare from knowing how much felt now can think speak of with little emotion must not have suffer on account for assure no longer suffer materially have many thing to support be not conscious of having provoked disappointment by imprudence of own have borne a much a possible without spreading farther acquit edward of essential misconduct wish very happy be so sure of always doing duty that though now may harbour regret in end must become so lucy doe not want sense be foundation on thing good may be built after marianne after be bewitching in idea of single constant attachment can be said of one happiness depending entirely on particular person be not meantit be not fitit be not possible that must be so edward will marry lucy will marry woman superior in person understanding to half sex time habit will teach to forget that ever thought superior to if such be way of thinking said marianne if loss of what be most valued be so easily to be made up by something else resolution self command be perhaps little le to be wondered atthey be brought more within comprehension understand suppose have ever felt much for four month marianne have have hanging on mind without being at liberty to speak of to single creature knowing that must make mother most unhappy whenever be explained to yet unable to prepare for in least be told meit be in manner forced on by very person whose prior engagement ruined prospect told a thought with triumph person suspicion therefore have have to oppose by endeavouring to appear indifferent where have be most deeply interested have not be only once have have hope exultation to listen to again again have known to be divided from edward for ever without hearing one circumstance must make le desire connection nothing have proved unworthy have anything declared indifferent to have have to contend against unkindness of sister insolence of mother have suffered punishment of attachment without enjoying advantage have be going on at time when a know too well have not be only unhappiness if can think capable of ever feeling surely may suppose have suffered now composure of mind with have brought at present to consider matter consolation have be willing to admit have be effect of constant painful exertion did not spring up of did not occur to relieve spirit at first marianne then if have not be bound to silence perhaps nothing must have kept entirelynot even what owed to dearest friendsfrom openly showing be very unhappy marianne be quite subdued oh elinor cried have made hate for everhow barbarous have be to youyou who have be only comfort who have borne with in misery who have seemed to be only suffering for mei gratitudeis only return can make youbecause merit cry out upon myself have be trying to do away tenderest caress followed confession in such frame of mind a be now in elinor have difficulty in obtaining from promise required at request marianne engaged never to speak of affair to one with least appearance of bitterness to meet lucy without betraying smallest increase of dislike to even to see edward if chance must bring together without diminution of usual cordiality be great concession where marianne felt that have injured reparation must be too much for to make performed promise of being discreet to admirationshe attended to that mr jennings have to say upon subject with unchanging complexion dissented from in nothing be heard three time to say yes maamshe listened to praise of lucy with only moving from one chair to when mr jennings talked of edward affection cost only spasm in throatsuch advance towards heroism in sister made elinor feel equal to thing next morning brought farther trial of in visit from brother who came with most serious aspect to talk over dreadful affair bring news of wife have heard suppose said with great solemnity a soon a be seated of very shocking discovery took place under roof yesterday looked assent seemed too awful moment for speech sister continued have suffered dreadfully mr ferrars tooin short have be scene of such complicated distressbut will hope that storm may be weathered without being of quite overcome poor fanny be in hysteric yesterday must not alarm too much donavan say there be nothing materially to be apprehended constitution be good one resolution equal to thing have borne with fortitude of angel say never will think well of anybody again one can not wonder at after being so deceivedmeeting with such ingratitude where so much kindness have be shown so much confidence have be placed be quite out of benevolence of heart that have asked young woman to house merely because thought deserved attention be harmless well behaved girl must be pleasant companion for otherwise wished very much to have invited marianne to be with while kind friend there be attending daughter now to be so rewarded wish with heart say poor fanny in affectionate way that have asked sister instead of here stopped to be thanked being done went on what poor mr ferrars suffered when first fanny broke to be not to be described while with truest affection have be planning most eligible connection for be to be supposed that must be time secretly engaged to suspicion must never have entered head if suspected prepossession elsewhere must not be in quarter there to be sure said might have thought safe be quite in agony consulted together however a to what must be done at last determined to send for edward came be sorry to relate what ensued that mr ferrars must say to make put end to engagement assisted too a may well suppose by argument fanny entreaty be of avail duty affection thing be disregarded never thought edward so stubborn so unfeeling before mother explained to liberal design in case of marrying miss morton told must settle on norfolk estate clear of land tax brings in good thousand year offered even when matter grew desperate to make twelve hundred in opposition to if still persisted in low connection represented to certain penury must attend match own two thousand pound protested must be must never see again so far must be from affording smallest assistance that if be to enter into profession with view of better support must do in power to prevent advancing in here marianne in ecstasy of indignation clapped hand together cried gracious god can be possible well may wonder marianne replied brother at obstinacy must resist such argument a exclamation be very natural marianne be going to retort remembered promise forbore however continued be urged in vain edward said very little what did say be in most determined manner nothing must prevail on to give up engagement must stand to cost what might then cried mr jennings with blunt sincerity no longer able to be silent have acted like honest man beg pardon mr dashwood if have done otherwise must have thought rascal have little concern in business a well a for lucy steele be cousin believe there be not better kind of girl in world one who more deserves good husband john dashwood be greatly astonished nature be calm not open to provocation never wished to offend anybody especially anybody of good fortune therefore replied without resentment must by mean speak disrespectfully of relation of yours madam miss lucy steele be dare say very deserving young woman in present case know connection must be impossible to have entered into secret engagement with young man under uncle care son of woman especially of such very large fortune a mr ferrars be perhaps altogether little extraordinary in short mean to reflect upon behaviour of person whom have regard for mr jennings wish extremely happy mr ferrarss conduct throughout whole have be such a conscientious good mother in like circumstance must adopt have be dignified liberal edward have drawn own lot fear will be bad one marianne sighed out similar apprehension elinors heart wrung for feeling of edward while braving mother threat for woman who must not reward well sir said mr jennings how did end be sorry to say maam in most unhappy ruptureedward be dismissed for ever from mother notice left house yesterday where be gone whether be still in town know for of course can make inquiry poor young manand what be to become of what indeed maam be melancholy consideration born to prospect of such affluence can not conceive situation more deplorable interest of two thousand poundshow can man live on itand when to be added recollection that might for own folly within three month have be in receipt of two thousand five hundred year for miss morton have thirty thousand pound can not picture to myself more wretched condition must feel for more so because be totally out of power to assist poor young man cried mr jennings be sure must be very welcome to bed board at house so must tell if must see be not fit that must be living about at own charge now at lodging tavern elinors heart thanked for such kindness towards edward though must not forbear smiling at form of if must only have done a well by said john dashwood a friend be disposed to do by might now have be in proper situation must have wanted for nothing a be must be out of anybodys power to assist there be one thing more preparing against must be worse than allhis mother have determined with very natural kind of spirit to settle estate upon robert immediately might have be edward on proper condition left morning with lawyer talking over business well said mr jennings be revenge everybody have way of own dont think mine must be to make one son independent because have plagued marianne got up walked about room can anything be more galling to spirit of man continued john than to see younger brother in possession of estate might have be own poor edward feel for sincerely few minute more spent in same kind of effusion concluded visit with repeated assurance to sister that really believed there be material danger in fanny indisposition that need not therefore be very uneasy about went away leaving three lady unanimous in sentiment on present occasion a far at least a regarded mr ferrarss conduct dashwoods edward mariannes indignation burst forth a soon a quitted room a vehemence made reserve impossible in elinor unnecessary in mr jennings joined in very spirited critique upon party chapter xxxviii mr jennings be very warm in praise of edward conduct only elinor marianne understood true merit only knew how little have have to tempt to be disobedient how small be consolation beyond consciousness of doing right must remain to in loss of friend fortune elinor gloried in integrity marianne forgave offence in compassion for punishment though confidence between be by public discovery restored to proper state be not subject on of be fond of dwelling when alone elinor avoided upon principle a tending to fix still more upon thought by too warm too positive assurance of marianne that belief of edward continued affection for herself rather wished to do away mariannes courage soon failed in trying to converse upon topic always left more dissatisfied with than ever by comparison necessarily produced between elinors conduct own felt force of comparison not a sister have hoped to urge to exertion now felt with pain of continual self reproach regretted most bitterly that have never exerted before brought only torture of penitence without hope of amendment mind be so much weakened that still fancied present exertion impossible therefore only dispirited more nothing new be heard by for day two afterwards of affair in harley street bartlett building though so much of matter be known to already that mr jennings might have have enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther without seeking after more have resolved from first to pay visit of comfort inquiry to cousin a soon a must nothing hindrance of more visitor than usual have prevented going to within time third day succeeding knowledge of particular be so fine so beautiful sunday a to draw many to kensington garden though be only second week in march mr jennings elinor be of number marianne who knew that willoughbys be again in town have constant dread of meeting chose rather to stay at home than venture into so public place intimate acquaintance of mr jennings joined soon after entered garden elinor be not sorry that by continuing with engaging mr jenningss conversation be left to quiet reflection saw nothing of willoughbys nothing of edward for time nothing of anybody who must by chance whether grave gay be interesting to at last found with surprise accosted by miss steele who though looking rather shy expressed great satisfaction in meeting on receiving encouragement from particular kindness of mr jennings left own party for short time to join theirs mr jennings immediately whispered to elinor get out of dear will tell thing if ask see can not leave mr clarke be lucky however for mr jenningss curiosity elinors too that must tell thing without being asked for

town mariannes impatience to be gone increased day sighed for air liberty quiet of country fancied that if place must give ease barton must do elinor be hardly le anxious than for removal only so much le bent on being effected immediately a be conscious of difficulty of so long journey marianne must not be brought to acknowledge began however seriously to turn thought towards accomplishment have already mentioned wish to kind hostess who resisted with eloquence of good will when plan be suggested though detaining from home yet few week longer appeared to elinor altogether much more eligible than other palmer be to remove to cleveland about end of march for easter holiday mr jennings with friend received very warm invitation from charlotte to go with must not in have be sufficient for delicacy of miss dashwoodbut be inforced with so much real politeness by mr palmer a joined to very great amendment of manner towards since sister have be known to be unhappy induced to accept with pleasure when told marianne what have done however first reply be not very auspicious clevelandshe cried with great agitation can not go to cleveland forget said elinor gently that situation be notthat be not in neighbourhood of be in somersetshirei can not go into somersetshirethere where looked forward to goingno elinor can not expect to go there elinor must not argue upon propriety of overcoming such feelingsshe only endeavoured to counteract by working on othersrepresented therefore a measure must fix time of returning to dear mother whom so much wished to see in more eligible more comfortable manner than other plan must do perhaps without greater delay from cleveland be within few mile of bristol distance to barton be not beyond one day though long day journey mother servant might easily come there to attend down a there must be occasion of staying above week at cleveland might now be at home in little more than three week time a mariannes affection for mother be sincere must triumph with little difficulty over imaginary evil have started mr jennings be so far from being weary of guest that pressed very earnestly to return with again from cleveland elinor be grateful for attention must not alter design mother concurrence being readily gained thing relative to return be arranged a far a must beand marianne found relief in drawing up statement of hour be yet to divide from barton ah colonel know what will do without miss dashwoodswas mr jenningss address to when first called on after leaving be settledfor be quite resolved upon going home from palmersand how forlorn will be when come backlord will sit gape at one a dull a two cat perhaps mr jennings be in hope by vigorous sketch of future ennui to provoke to make offer might give escape from if so have soon afterwards good reason to think object gained for on elinors moving to window to take more expeditiously dimension of print be going to copy for friend followed to with look of particular meaning conversed with there for several minute effect of discourse on lady too must not escape observation for though be too honorable to listen have even changed seat on purpose that might not hear to one close by piano forte on marianne be playing must not keep from seeing that elinor changed colour attended with agitation be too intent on what said to pursue employment still farther in confirmation of hope in interval of mariannes turning from one lesson to word of colonel inevitably reached ear in seemed to be apologising for badness of house set matter beyond doubt wondered indeed at thinking necessary to do so supposed to be proper etiquette what elinor said in reply must not distinguish judged from motion of lip that did not think that material objection mr jennings commended in heart for being so honest then talked on for few minute longer without catching syllable when lucky stop in mariannes performance brought word in colonel calm voice be afraid can not take place very soon astonished shocked at so unlover like speech be almost ready to cry out lord what must hinder itbut checking desire confined to silent ejaculation be very strangesure need not wait to be older delay on colonel side however did not seem to offend mortify fair companion in least for on breaking up conference soon afterwards moving different way mr jennings very plainly heard elinor say with voice showed to feel what said will always think very much obliged to mr jennings be delighted with gratitude only wondered that after hearing sentence colonel must be able to take leave of a immediately did with utmost sang froid go away without making reply have not thought old friend must have made so indifferent suitor have really passed between be to effect have heard said with great compassion of injustice friend mr ferrars have suffered from family for if understand matter right have be entirely cast off by for persevering in engagement with very deserving young woman have be rightly informed be so elinor told that be cruelty impolitic cruelty replied with great feeling of dividing attempting to divide two young people long attached to other be terrible mr ferrars doe not know what may be doingwhat may drive son to have seen mr ferrars two three time in harley street be much pleased with be not young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in short time have seen enough of to wish well for own sake a friend of yours wish still more understand that intends to take order will be so good a to tell that living of delaford now just vacant a be informed by day post be if think worth acceptance that perhaps so unfortunately circumstanced a be now may be nonsense to appear to doubt only wish be more valuable be rectory small one late incumbent believe did not make more than per annum though be certainly capable of improvement fear not to amount a to afford very comfortable income such a be however pleasure in presenting to will be very great pray assure of elinors astonishment at commission must hardly have be greater have colonel be really making offer of hand preferment only two day before have considered a hopeless for edward be already provided to enable to marry of people in world be fixed on to bestow emotion be such a mr jennings have attributed to very different cause minor feeling le pure le pleasing might have share in emotion esteem for general benevolence gratitude for particular friendship together prompted colonel brandon to act be strongly felt warmly expressed thanked for with heart spoke of edward principle disposition with praise knew to deserve promised to undertake commission with pleasure if be really wish to put off so agreeable office to at same time must not help thinking that one must so well perform a be office in short from unwilling to give edward pain of receiving obligation from must have be very glad to be spared colonel brandon on motif of equal delicacy declining likewise still seemed so desirous of being given through mean that must not on account make farther opposition edward believed be still in town fortunately have heard address from miss steele must undertake therefore to inform of in course of day after have be settled colonel brandon began to talk of own advantage in securing so respectable agreeable neighbour then be that mentioned with regret that house be small indifferent evil elinor a mr jennings have supposed to do made very light of at least a far a regarded size smallness of house said can not imagine inconvenience to for will be in proportion to family income by colonel be surprised to find that be considering mr ferrarss marriage a certain consequence of presentation for did not suppose possible that delaford living must supply such income a anybody in style of life must venture to settle on said so little rectory can do more than make mr ferrars comfortable a bachelor can not enable to marry be sorry to say that patronage end with interest be hardly more extensive if however by unforeseen chance must be in power to serve farther must think very differently of from what now do if be not a ready to be useful to then a sincerely wish must be at present what be now doing indeed seems nothing at since can advance so little towards what must be principal only object of happiness marriage must still be distant good at least be afraid can not take place very soon such be sentence when misunderstood so justly offended delicate feeling of mr jennings after narration of what really passed between colonel brandon elinor while stood at window gratitude expressed by latter on parting may perhaps appear in general not le reasonably excited le properly worded than if have arisen from offer of marriage chapter xl well miss dashwood said mr jennings sagaciously smiling a soon a gentleman have withdrawn ask what colonel have be saying to for though upon honour tried to keep out of hearing must not help catching enough to understand business assure never be better pleased in life wish joy of with heart thank maam said elinor be matter of great joy to feel goodness of colonel brandon most sensibly there be not many men who must act a have done few people who have so compassionate heart never be more astonished in life lord dear be very modest ant least astonished at in world for have often thought of late there be nothing more likely to happen judged from knowledge of colonel general benevolence at least must not foresee that opportunity must so very soon occur opportunity repeated mr jenningsoh a to when man have once made up mind to thing somehow other will soon find opportunity well dear wish joy of again again if ever there be happy couple in world think will soon know where to look for mean to go to delaford after suppose said elinor with faint smile aye dear do indeed a to house being bad one know what colonel must be at for be a good one a ever saw spoke of being out of repair well whose fault be that why dont repair itwho must do be interrupted by servant coming in to announce carriage being at door mr jennings immediately preparing to go said well dear must be gone before have have half talk out however may have over in evening for will be quite alone ask to go with for dare say mind be too full of matter to care for company besides must long to tell sister about marianne have left room before conversation began certainly maam will tell marianne of will not mention at present to body else oh very well said mr jennings rather disappointed then must not have tell to lucy for think of going a far a holborn to day maam not even lucy if please one day delay will not be very material till have written to mr ferrars think ought not to be mentioned to body else will do directly be of importance that time must be lost with for will of course have much to do relative to ordination speech at first puzzled mr jennings exceedingly why mr ferrars be to have be written to about in hurry must not immediately comprehend few moment reflection however produced very happy idea exclaimed oh hoi understand mr ferrars be to be man well so much better for ay to be sure must be ordained in readiness be very glad to find thing be so forward between dear be not rather out of character must not colonel write himselfsure be proper person elinor did not quite understand beginning of mr jenningss speech did think worth inquiring into therefore only replied to conclusion colonel brandon be so delicate man that rather wished one to announce intention to mr ferrars than so be forced to do well be odd kind of delicacy however will not disturb seeing preparing to write know own concern best so goodby dear have not heard of thing to please so well since charlotte be brought to bed away went returning again in moment have just be thinking of bettys sister dear must be very glad to get so good mistress whether must do for lady maid be sure cant tell be excellent housemaid work very well at needle however will think of at leisure certainly maam replied elinor not hearing much of what said more anxious to be alone than to be mistress of subject how must beginhow must express in note to edward be now concern particular circumstance between made difficulty of to other person must have be easiest thing in world equally feared to say too much too little sat deliberating over paper with pen in hand till broken in on by entrance of edward have met mr jennings at door in way to carriage a came to leave farewell card after apologising for not returning have obliged to enter by saying that miss dashwood be above wanted to speak with on very particular business elinor have just be congratulating in midst of perplexity that however difficult might be to express properly by letter be at least preferable to giving information by word of mouth when visitor entered to force upon greatest exertion of astonishment confusion be very great on so sudden appearance have not seen before since engagement became public therefore not since knowing to be acquainted with with consciousness of what have be thinking of what have to tell made feel particularly uncomfortable for minute too be much distressed sat down together in most promising state of embarrassmentwhether have asked pardon for intrusion on first coming into room must not recollect determining to be on safe side made apology in form a soon a must say thing after taking chair mr jennings told said that wished to speak with at least understood soor certainly must not have intruded on in manner though at same time must have be extremely sorry to leave london without seeing sister especially a will most likely be timeit be not probable must soon have pleasure of meeting again go to oxford tomorrow must not have gone however said elinor recovering determined to get over what so much dreaded a soon a possible without receiving good wish even if have not be able to give in person mr jennings be quite right in what said have something of consequence to inform of be on point of communicating by paper be charged with most agreeable office breathing rather faster than usual a spoke colonel brandon who be here only ten minute ago have desired to say that understanding mean to take order have great pleasure in offering living of delaford now just vacant only wish be more valuable allow to congratulate on having so respectable well judging friend to join in wish that livingit be about two hundred yearwere much more considerable such a might better enable toas might be more than temporary accommodation to yourselfsuch in short a might establish view of happiness what edward felt a must not say can not be expected that one else must say for looked astonishment such unexpected such unthought of information must not fail of exciting said only two word colonel brandon yes continued elinor gathering more resolution a of worst be over colonel brandon mean a testimony of concern for what have lately passedfor cruel situation in unjustifiable conduct of family have placed youa concern be sure marianne friend must share likewise a proof of high esteem for general character particular approbation of behaviour on present occasion colonel brandon give livingcan be possible unkindness of own relation have made astonished to find friendship where replied with sudden consciousness not to find in for can not be ignorant that to to goodness owe alli feel iti must express if couldbut a well know be orator be very much mistaken do assure that owe entirely at least almost entirely to own merit colonel brandons discernment of have have hand in did not even know till understood design that living be vacant have ever occurred to that might have have living in gift a friend of mine of family may perhapsindeed know have still greater pleasure in bestowing upon word owe nothing to solicitation truth obliged to acknowledge small share in action be at same time so unwilling to appear a benefactress of edward that acknowledged with hesitation probably contributed to fix suspicion in mind have recently entered for short time sat deep in thought after elinor have ceased to speakat last a if be rather effort said colonel brandon seems man of great worth respectability have always heard spoken of a such brother know esteem highly be undoubtedly sensible man in manner perfectly gentleman indeed replied elinor believe that will find on farther acquaintance that have heard to be a will be such very near neighbour for understand parsonage be almost close to mansion house be particularly important that must be edward made answer when have turned away head gave look so serious so earnest so uncheerful a seemed to say that might hereafter wish distance between parsonage mansion house much greater colonel brandon think lodge in st james street said soon afterwards rising from chair elinor told number of house must hurry away then to give thanks will not allow to give to assure that have made veryan exceedingly happy man elinor did not offer to detain parted with very earnest assurance on side of unceasing good wish for happiness in change of situation might befall on with rather attempt to return same good will than power of expressing when see again said elinor to herself a door shut out will see husband of lucy with pleasing anticipation sat down to reconsider past recall word endeavour to comprehend feeling of edward of course to reflect on own with discontent when mr jennings came home though returned from seeing people whom have never seen before of whom therefore must have great deal to say mind be so much more occupied by important secret in possession than by anything else that reverted to again a soon a elinor appeared well dear cried sent up young man did not do rightand suppose have great difficultyyou did not find very unwilling to accept proposal maam be not very likely well how soon will be readyfor seems to depend upon really said elinor know so little of kind of form can hardly even conjecture a to time preparation necessary suppose two three month will complete ordination two three month cried mr jennings lord dear how calmly talk of can colonel wait two three month lord bless mei be sure must put quite out of patienceand though one must be very glad to do kindness by poor mr ferrars do think be not worth while to wait two three month for sure somebody else might be found must do a well somebody be in order already dear maam said elinor what can be thinking of why colonel brandons only object be to be of use to mr ferrars lord bless dear sure mean to persuade that colonel only marries for sake of giving ten guinea to mr ferrars deception must not continue after explanation immediately took place by gained considerable amusement for moment without material loss of happiness to for mr jennings only exchanged one form of delight for still without forfeiting expectation of first aye aye parsonage be small one said after first ebullition of surprise satisfaction be over very likely may be out of repair to hear man apologising a thought for house that to knowledge have five sitting room on ground floor think housekeeper told must make up fifteen bed to too have be used to live in barton cottage seems quite ridiculous dear must touch up colonel to do thing to parsonage make comfortable for before lucy go to colonel brandon doe not seem to have idea of living being enough to allow to marry colonel be ninny dear because have two thousand year think that nobody else can marry on le take word for that if be alive will be paying visit at delaford parsonage before michaelmas be sure shant go if lucy ant there elinor be quite of opinion a to probability of not waiting for thing more chapter xli edward having carried thanks to colonel brandon proceeded with happiness to lucy such be excess of by time reached bartlett building that be able to assure mr jennings who called on again next day with congratulation that have never seen in such spirit before in life own happiness own spirit be at least very certain joined mr jennings most heartily in expectation of being comfortably together in delaford parsonage before michaelmas so far be at same time from backwardness to give elinor that credit edward must give that spoke of friendship for with most grateful warmth be ready to own obligation to openly declared that exertion for good on miss dashwoods part present future must ever surprise for believed capable of doing thing in world for really valued a for colonel brandon be not only ready to worship a saint be moreover truly anxious that must be treated a one in worldly concern anxious that tithe must be raised to utmost secretly resolved to avail at delaford a far a possibly must of servant carriage cow poultry be now above week since john dashwood have called in berkeley street a since time notice have be taken by of wife indisposition beyond one verbal enquiry elinor began to feel necessary to pay visitthis be obligation however not only opposed own inclination have not assistance of encouragement from companion marianne not contented with absolutely refusing to go be very urgent to prevent sister going at mr jennings though carriage be always at elinors service so very much disliked mr john dashwood that not even curiosity to see how looked after late discovery strong desire to affront by taking edward part must overcome unwillingness to be in company again consequence be that elinor set out by to pay visit for one must really have le inclination to run risk of tte tte with woman whom of others have so much reason to dislike mr dashwood be denied before carriage must turn from house husband accidentally came out expressed great pleasure in meeting elinor told that have be just going to call in berkeley street assuring that fanny must be very glad to see invited to come in walked up stair in to drawing roomnobody be there fanny be in own room suppose said will go to presently for be sure will not have least objection in world to seeing very far from indeed now especially there can not bebut however marianne be always great favourite why must not marianne come elinor made what excuse must for be not sorry to see alone replied for have good deal to say to living of colonel brandonscan be truehas really given to edwardi heard yesterday by chance be coming to on purpose to enquire farther about be perfectly truecolonel brandon have given living of delaford to edward reallywell be very astonishingno relationshipno connection between themand now that living fetch pricewhat be value of about two hundred year very welland for next presentation to living of valuesupposing late incumbent to have be old sickly likely to vacate soonhe might have got dare sayfourteen hundred pound how came not to have settled matter before person death now indeed must be too late to sell man of colonel brandons sense wonder must be so improvident in point of such common such natural concern well be convinced that there be vast deal of inconsistency in almost human character suppose howeveron recollectionthat case may probably be edward be only to hold living till person to whom colonel have really sold presentation be old enough to take aye aye be fact depend upon elinor contradicted however very positively by relating that have be employed in conveying offer from colonel brandon to edward therefore must understand term on be given obliged to submit to authority be truly astonishinghe cried after hearing what saidwhat must be colonel motive very simple oneto be of use to mr ferrars well well colonel brandon may be edward be very lucky manyou will not mention matter to fanny however for though have broke to bear vastly wellshe will not like to hear much talked of elinor have difficulty here to refrain from observing that thought fanny might have borne with composure acquisition of wealth to brother by child must be possibly impoverished mr ferrars added lowering voice to tone becoming so important subject know nothing about at present believe will be best to keep entirely concealed from a long a may be when marriage take place fear must hear of why must such precaution be used though be not to be supposed that mr ferrars can have smallest satisfaction in knowing that son have money enough to live upon for must be quite out of question yet why upon late behaviour be supposed to feel at have done with sonshe cast off for ever have made over whom have influence cast off likewise surely after doing so can not be imagined liable to impression of sorrow of joy on account can not be interested in thing befalls must not be so weak a to throw away comfort of child yet retain anxiety of parent ah elinor said john reasoning be very good be founded on ignorance of human nature when edward unhappy match take place depend upon mother will feel a much a if have never discarded therefore circumstance may accelerate dreadful event must be concealed from a much a possible mr ferrars can never forget edward be son surprise must think must nearly have escaped memory by time wrong exceedingly mr ferrars be one of most affectionate mother in world elinor be silent think nowsaid mr dashwood after short pause of robert marrying miss morton elinor smiling at grave decisive importance of brother tone calmly replied lady suppose have choice in affair choicehow do mean only mean that suppose from manner of speaking must be same to miss morton whether marry edward robert certainly there can be difference for robert will now to intent purpose be considered a eldest sonand a to thing else be very agreeable young men know that one be superior to other elinor said more john be also for short time silenthis reflection ended thus of one thing dear sister kindly taking hand speaking in awful whisper may assure youand will do because know must gratify have good reason to thinkindeed have from best authority must not repeat for otherwise must be very wrong to say thing about itbut have from very best authoritynot that ever precisely heard mr ferrars say herselfbut daughter did have from herthat in short whatever objection there might be against certaina certain connection understand meit must have be far preferable to herit must not have given vexation that doe be exceedingly pleased to hear that mr ferrars considered in light very gratifying circumstance know to must have be beyond comparison said least evil of two must be glad to compound now for nothing worse however be quite out of questionnot to be thought of mentionedas to attachment know never must be be gone by thought must just tell of because knew how much must please not that have reason to regret dear elinor there be doubt of doing exceedingly wellquite a well better perhaps thing considered have colonel brandon be with lately elinor have heard enough if not to gratify vanity raise self importance to agitate nerve fill mindand be therefore glad to be spared from necessity of saying much in reply from danger of hearing thing more from brother by entrance of mr robert ferrars after few moment chat john dashwood recollecting that fanny be yet uninformed of sister being there quitted room in quest of elinor be left to improve acquaintance with robert who by gay unconcern happy self complacency of manner while enjoying so unfair division of mother love liberality to prejudice of banished brother earned only by own dissipated course of life that brother integrity be confirming most unfavourable opinion of head heart have scarcely be two minute by before began to speak of edward for too have heard of living be very inquisitive on subject elinor repeated particular of a have given to john effect on robert though very different be not le striking than have be on laughed most immoderately idea of edward being clergyman living in small parsonage house diverted beyond measureand when to be added fanciful imagery of edward reading prayer in white surplice publishing banns of marriage between john smith mary brown must conceive nothing more ridiculous elinor while waited in silence immovable gravity conclusion of such folly must not restrain eye from being fixed on with look spoke contempt excited be look however very well bestowed for relieved own feeling gave intelligence to be recalled from wit to wisdom not by reproof of hers by own sensibility may treat a joke said at last recovering from affected laugh have considerably lengthened out genuine gaiety of moment upon soul be most serious business poor edward be ruined for ever be extremely sorry for for know to be very good hearted creature a well meaning fellow perhaps a in world must not judge of miss dashwood from slight acquaintance poor edward manner be certainly not happiest in nature be not born know with same powersthe same address poor fellow to see in circle of stranger to be sure be pitiable enough upon soul believe have a good heart a in kingdom declare protest to never be so shocked in life a when burst forth must not believe mother be first person who told of feeling called on to act with resolution immediately said to dear madam know what may intend to do on occasion a for must say that if edward doe marry young woman never will see again be what said immediately be most uncommonly shocked indeed poor edward have done for completelyshut out for ever from decent society a directly said to mother be not in least surprised at from style of education be always to be expected poor mother be half frantic have ever seen lady yes once while be staying in house happened to drop in for ten minute saw quite enough of merest awkward country girl without style elegance almost without beauty remember perfectly just kind of girl must suppose likely to captivate poor edward offered immediately a soon a mother related affair to to talk to dissuade from match be too late then found to do thing for unluckily be not in way at first knew nothing of till after breach have taken place when be not for know to interfere have be informed of few hour earlier think be most probable that something might have be hit on certainly must have represented to edward in very strong light dear fellow must have said consider what be doing be making most disgraceful connection one a family be unanimous in disapproving can not help thinking in short mean might have be found now be all too late must be starved know be certain absolutely starved have just settled point with great composure when entrance of mr john dashwood put end to subject though never spoke of out of own family elinor must see influence on mind in something like confusion of countenance with entered attempt at cordiality in behaviour to herself even proceeded so far a to be concerned to find elinor sister be so soon to leave town a have hoped to see more of theman exertion in husband who attended into room hung enamoured over accent seemed to distinguish thing be most affectionate graceful chapter xlii one other short call in harley

happy privilege of country liberty of wandering from place to place in free luxurious solitude resolved to spend almost hour of day while remained with palmer in indulgence of such solitary ramble returned just in time to join others a quitted house on excursion through more immediate premise rest of morning be easily whiled away in lounging round kitchen garden examining bloom upon wall listening to gardener lamentation upon blight in dawdling through green house where loss of favourite plant unwarily exposed nipped by lingering frost raised laughter of charlotteand in visiting

small hour passed quietly away mr palmer have child mr jennings carpet work talked of friend have left behind arranged lady middleton engagement wondered whether mr palmer colonel brandon must get farther than reading night elinor however little concerned in joined in discourse marianne who have knack of finding way in house to library however might be avoided by family in general soon procured book nothing be wanting on mr palmer side that constant friendly good humour must do to make feel welcome openness heartiness of manner more than atoned for want of recollection elegance made often deficient in form of politeness kindness recommended by so pretty face be engaging folly though evident be not disgusting because be not conceited elinor must have forgiven thing laugh two gentleman arrived next day to very late dinner affording pleasant enlargement of party very welcome variety to conversation long morning of same continued rain have reduced very low elinor have seen so little of mr palmer in little have seen so much variety in address to sister that knew not what to expect to find in own family found however perfectly gentleman in behaviour to visitor only occasionally rude to wife mother found very capable of being pleasant companion only prevented from being so always by too great aptitude to fancy a much superior to people in general a must feel to be to mr

observation of epicurism selfishness conceit to rest with complacency on remembrance of edward generous temper simple taste diffident feeling of edward at least of of concern now received intelligence from colonel brandon who have be into dorsetshire lately who treating at once a disinterested friend of mr ferrars kind confidante of talked to great deal of parsonage at delaford described deficiency told what meant to do towards removing themhis behaviour to in a well a in other particular open pleasure in meeting after absence of only ten day readiness to converse with deference for opinion

cure entirely be with difficulty elinor prevailed on when went to bed to try one two of simplest of remedy chapter xliii marianne got up next morning at usual time to inquiry replied that be better tried to prove so by engaging in accustomary employment day spent in sitting shivering over fire with book in hand be unable to read in lying weary languid on sofa did not speak much in favour of amendment when at last went early to bed more more indisposed colonel brandon be only astonished at sister composure who though attending nursing whole day against mariannes inclination forcing proper medicine on at night trusted like marianne to certainty efficacy of sleep felt real alarm very restless feverish night however disappointed expectation of when marianne after persisting in rising confessed unable to sit up returned voluntarily to bed elinor be very ready to adopt mr jenningss advice of sending for palmer apothecary came examined patient though encouraging miss dashwood to expect that very few day must restore sister to health yet by pronouncing disorder to have putrid tendency allowing word infection to pas lip gave instant alarm to mr palmer on baby account mr jennings who have be inclined from first to think mariannes complaint more serious than elinor now looked very grave on mr harris report confirming charlotte fear caution urged necessity of immediate removal with infant mr palmer though treating apprehension a idle found anxiety importunity of wife too great to be withstood departure therefore be fixed on within hour after mr harris arrival set off with little boy nurse for house of near relation of mr palmer who lived few mile on other side of bath husband promised at earnest entreaty to join in day two whither be almost equally urgent with mother to accompany mr jennings however with kindness of heart made elinor really love declared resolution of not stirring from cleveland a long a marianne remained ill of endeavouring by own attentive care to supply to place of mother have taken from elinor found on occasion most willing active helpmate desirous to share in fatigue often by better experience in nursing of material use

amendment did not appear worse party be now farther reduced for mr palmer though very unwilling to go a well from real humanity good nature a from dislike of appearing to be frightened away by wife be persuaded at last by colonel brandon to perform promise of following while be preparing to go colonel brandon with much greater exertion began to talk of going likewisehere however kindness of mr jennings interposed most acceptably for to send colonel away while love be in so much uneasiness on sister account must be to deprive thought of comfort therefore telling at once that stay at cleveland be necessary to herself that must want to play at piquet of evening while miss dashwood be above with sister c urged so strongly to remain that who be gratifying first wish of own heart by compliance must not long even affect to demur especially a mr jenningss entreaty be warmly seconded by mr palmer who seemed to feel relief to in leaving behind person so well able to assist advise miss dashwood in emergence marianne be of course kept in ignorance of arrangement knew not that have be mean of sending owner of cleveland away in about seven day from time of arrival gave surprise that saw nothing of mr palmer a gave likewise concern never mentioned name two day passed away from time of mr palmer departure situation continued with little variation same mr harris who attended

colonel brandon who be chiefly of use in listening to mr jenningss foreboding be not in state of mind to resist influence tried to reason out of fear different judgment of apothecary seemed to render absurd many hour of day in be left entirely alone be too favourable for admission of melancholy idea must not expel from mind persuasion that must see marianne more on morning of third day however gloomy anticipation of be almost done away for when mr harris arrived declared patient materially better pulse be much stronger symptom more favourable than on preceding visit elinor confirmed in pleasant hope be cheerfulness rejoicing that in letter to mother have pursued own judgment rather than friend in making very light of indisposition delayed at cleveland almost fixing on time when marianne must be able to travel day did not close so auspiciously a began towards evening marianne became ill again growing more heavy restless uncomfortable than before sister however still sanguine be willing to attribute change to nothing more than fatigue of having sat up to have bed made carefully administering cordial prescribed saw with satisfaction sink at last into slumber from expected most beneficial effect sleep though not so quiet a elinor wished to see lasted considerable time anxious to observe result of resolved to sit with during whole of mr jennings knowing nothing of change in patient went unusually early to bed maid who be one of principal nurse be recreating in housekeeper room elinor remained alone with repose of latter became more more disturbed sister who watched with unremitting attention continual change of posture heard frequent inarticulate sound of complaint passed lip be almost wishing to rouse from so painful slumber when marianne suddenly awakened by accidental noise in house started hastily up with feverish wildness cried out be mama coming not yet cried other concealing terror assisting marianne to lie down again will be here hope before be long be great way know from hence to barton must not go round by london cried marianne in same hurried manner will never see if go by london elinor perceived with alarm that be not quite while attempting to soothe eagerly felt pulse be lower quicker than ever marianne still talking wildly of mama alarm increased so rapidly a to determine on sending instantly for mr harris despatching messenger to barton for mother to consult with colonel brandon on best mean of effecting latter be thought immediately followed resolution of performance a soon have rung up maid to take place by sister hastened

despatch calculated with exactness time in might look for return not moment be lost in delay of kind horse arrived even before be expected colonel brandon only pressing hand with look of solemnity few word spoken too low to reach ear hurried into carriage be then about twelve oclock returned to sister apartment to wait for arrival of apothecary to watch by rest of night be night of almost equal suffering to hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain delirium on mariannes side in most cruel anxiety on elinors before mr harris appeared apprehension once raised paid by excess for former security servant who sat up with for must not allow mr jennings to be called only tortured more by hint of what mistress have always thought mariannes idea be still at interval fixed incoherently on mother whenever mentioned name gave pang to heart of poor elinor who reproaching for having trifled with so many day of illness wretched for immediate relief fancied that relief might soon be in vain that thing have be delayed too long pictured to herself suffering mother arriving too late to see darling child to see rational be on point of sending again for mr harris if must not come for other advice when formerbut not till after five oclockarrived opinion however made little amends for delay for though acknowledging very unexpected unpleasant alteration in patient must not allow danger to be material talked of relief fresh mode of treatment must procure with confidence in lesser degree be communicated to elinor promised to call again in course of three four hour left patient anxious attendant more composed than have found with strong concern with many reproach for not being called to aid did mr jennings hear in morning of what have passed former apprehension now with greater

have fixed on colonel brandons marrying one of a object most desirable believe marianne will be most happy with of two elinor be half inclined to ask reason for thinking so because satisfied that none founded on impartial consideration of age character feeling must be givenbut mother must always be carried away by imagination on interesting subject therefore instead of inquiry passed off with smile

rising colour a spokeand unsteady voice plainly showed wish to assure said that see thingas can desire to do mr dashwood must have interrupted instantly with soothing tenderness have not elinor who

consider matter said elinor exactly a good mind sound understanding must consider dare say perceive a well a not only in in many other circumstance reason enough to be convinced that marriage must have involved in many certain trouble disappointment in must have be poorly supported by affection on side much le certain have married must have be always poor expensiveness be acknowledged even by whole conduct declares that self denial be word hardly understood by demand inexperience together on small very small income must have brought on distress must not be le grievous to from having be entirely unknown unthought of before sense of honour honesty must have led know when aware of situation to attempt economy must appear to possible perhaps a long a frugality retrenched only on own comfort might have be suffered to practice beyond thatand how little must utmost of single management do to stop ruin have begun before marriage beyond have endeavoured however reasonably to abridge enjoyment be not to be feared that instead of prevailing on feeling so selfish to consent to must have lessened own influence on heart made regret connection have involved in such difficulty mariannes lip quivered repeated word selfish in tone implieddo really think selfish whole of behaviour replied elinor from beginning to end of affair have be grounded on selfishness be selfishness first made sport with affection afterwards when own be engaged made delay confession of finally carried from barton own enjoyment own ease be in particular ruling principle be very true happiness never be object

good income a of far more importance even to domestic happiness than mere temper of wife have not doubt of said marianne have nothing to regretnothing own folly rather say mother imprudence child said mr dashwood must be answerable marianne must not let proceedand elinor satisfied that felt own error wished to avoid survey of past might weaken sister spirit therefore pursuing first subject immediately continued one observation may think be fairly drawn from whole of storythat willoughbys difficulty have arisen from first offence against virtue in behaviour to eliza williams crime have be origin of lesser one of present discontent marianne assented most feelingly to remark mother be led by to enumeration of colonel brandons injury merit warm a friendship design must unitedly dictate daughter did not look however a if much of be heard by elinor according to expectation saw on two three following day marianne did not continue to gain strength a have done while resolution be unsubdued still tried to appear cheerful easy sister must safely trust to effect of time upon health margaret returned family be again all restored to other again quietly settled at cottage if not pursuing usual study with quite so much vigour a when first came to barton at least planning vigorous prosecution of in future elinor grew impatient for tidings of edward have heard nothing of since leaving london nothing new of plan nothing certain even of present abode letter have passed between brother in consequence of mariannes illness in first of john there have be sentencewe know nothing of unfortunate edward can make enquiry on so prohibited subject conclude to be still at oxford be intelligence of edward afforded by correspondence for name be not even mentioned in of succeeding

errand be voluntary communication suppose know maam that mr ferrars be married marianne gave violent start fixed eye upon elinor saw turning pale fell back in chair in hysteric mr dashwood whose eye a answered servant inquiry have intuitively taken same direction be shocked to perceive by elinors countenance how much really suffered moment afterwards alike distressed by mariannes situation knew not on child to bestow principal attention servant who saw only that miss marianne be taken ill have sense enough to call one of maid who with mr dashwoods assistance supported into other room by time marianne be rather better mother leaving to care of margaret maid returned to elinor who though still much disordered have so far recovered use of reason voice a to be just beginning inquiry of thomas a to source of intelligence mr dashwood immediately took trouble on herself elinor have benefit of information without exertion of seeking who told that mr ferrars be married thomas see mr ferrars maam morning in exeter lady too miss steele a be be stopping in chaise at door of new london inn a went there with message from sally at park to brother who be one of post boy happened to look up a

call here mr dashwood now looked at daughter elinor knew better than to expect recognised whole of lucy in message be very confident that edward must never come near observed in low voice to mother that be probably going down to mr pratts near plymouth thomas intelligence seemed over elinor looked a if wished to hear more did see off before came away maamthe horse be just coming out must not bide longer be afraid of being late did mr ferrars look well yes maam said how be very well to mind be always very handsome young ladyand seemed vastly contented mr dashwood must think of other question thomas tablecloth now alike needle be soon afterwards dismissed marianne have already sent to say that must eat nothing more mr dashwoods elinors appetite be equally lost margaret might think very well off with so much uneasiness a sister have lately experienced so much reason a have often have to be careless of meal have never be obliged to go without dinner before when dessert wine be arranged mr dashwood elinor be left by remained long together in similarity of thoughtfulness silence mr dashwood feared to hazard remark ventured not to offer consolation now found that have erred in relying on elinors representation of herself justly concluded that thing have be expressly softened at time to spare from increase of unhappiness suffering a then have suffered for marianne found that have be misled by careful considerate attention of daughter to think attachment once have so well understood much slighter in reality than have be wont to believe than be now proved to be feared that under persuasion have be unjust inattentive nay almost unkind to elinorthat mariannes affliction because more acknowledged more immediately before have too much engrossed tenderness led away to forget in elinor might have daughter suffering almost a much certainly with le self provocation greater fortitude chapter xlviii elinor now found difference between expectation of unpleasant event however certain mind may be told to consider certainty now found that in spite of have always admitted hope while edward remained single that something must occur to prevent marrying lucy that resolution of own mediation of friend more eligible opportunity of establishment for lady must arise to assist happiness of be now married condemned heart for lurking flattery so much heightened pain of intelligence that must be married soon before a imagined must be in order consequently before must be in possession of living surprised little at first soon saw how likely be that lucy in self provident care in haste to secure must overlook thing risk of delay be married married in town now hastening down to uncle what have edward felt on being within four mile from barton on seeing mother servant on hearing lucy message must soon supposed be settled at delaforddelafordthat place in so much conspired to give interest wished to be acquainted with yet desired to avoid saw in instant in

flattered that one of connection in london must write to to announce event give farther particularsbut day after day passed off brought letter tidings though uncertain that one be to blame found fault with absent friend be thoughtless indolent when do write to colonel brandon maam be inquiry sprung from impatience of mind to have something going on wrote to love last week rather expect to see than to hear from again earnestly pressed coming to must not be surprised to see walk in today tomorrow day be gaining something something to look forward to colonel brandon must have information to give scarcely have so determined when figure of man on horseback drew eye to window stopt at gate be gentleman be colonel brandon now must hear more trembled in expectation of be not colonel brandon air height be possible must say must be edward looked again have just dismounted must not be mistakenit be edward moved away sat down come from mr pratts purposely to see will be calm will be mistress of in moment perceived that others be likewise aware of mistake saw mother marianne change colour saw look at whisper few sentence to other must have given world to be able to speakand to make understand that hoped coolness slight must appear in behaviour to himbut have utterance be obliged to leave to own discretion not syllable passed aloud waited in silence for appearance of visitor footstep be heard along gravel path in moment be in passage in be before countenance a entered room be not too happy even for elinor complexion be white with agitation looked a if fearful of reception conscious that merited kind one mr dashwood however conforming a trusted to wish of daughter by whom then meant in warmth of heart to be guided in thing met with look of forced complacency gave hand wished joy coloured stammered out unintelligible reply elinors lip have moved with mother when moment of action be over wished that have shaken hand with too be then too late with countenance meaning to be open sat down again talked of weather marianne have retreated a much a possible out of sight to conceal distress margaret understanding part not whole of case thought incumbent on to be dignified therefore took seat a far from a must maintained strict silence when elinor have ceased to rejoice in dryness of season very awful pause took place be put end to by mr dashwood who felt obliged to hope that have left mr ferrars very well in hurried manner replied in affirmative pause elinor resolving to exert though fearing sound of own voice now said be mr ferrars at longstaple at longstaple replied with air of surprise mother be in town meant said elinor taking up work from table to enquire for mr edward ferrars dared not look upbut mother marianne turned eye on coloured seemed perplexed looked doubtingly after hesitation said perhaps meanmy brotheryou mean mrsmrs robert ferrars mr robert ferrars be repeated by marianne mother in accent of utmost amazement though elinor must not speak even eye be fixed on with same impatient wonder rose from seat walked to window apparently from not knowing what to do took up pair of scissors lay there while spoiling sheath by cutting latter to piece a spoke said in hurried voice perhaps know may not have heard that brother be lately married toto youngestto miss lucy steele word be echoed with unspeakable astonishment by elinor who sat with head leaning over work in state of such agitation a made hardly know where be yes said be married last week be now at dawlish elinor must sit no longer almost ran out of room a soon a door be closed burst into tear of joy at first thought must never cease edward who have till then looked where rather than at saw hurry away perhaps sawor even heard emotion for immediately afterwards fell into reverie remark inquiry affectionate address of mr dashwood must penetrate at last without saying word quitted room walked out towards villageleaving others in greatest astonishment perplexity on change in situation so wonderful so suddena perplexity have mean of lessening by own conjecture chapter xlix unaccountable however a circumstance of release might appear to whole family be certain that edward be free to what purpose freedom must be employed be easily pre determined by allfor after experiencing blessing of one imprudent engagement contracted without mother consent a have already done for more than four year nothing le must be expected of in failure of than immediate contraction of errand at barton in fact be simple one be only to ask elinor to marry himand considering that be not altogether inexperienced in such question might be strange that must feel so uncomfortable in present case a really did so much in need of encouragement fresh air how soon have walked into proper resolution however how soon opportunity of exercising occurred in what manner expressed how be received need not be particularly told only need be saidthat when sat down to table at four oclock about three hour after arrival have secured lady engaged mother consent be not only in rapturous profession of lover in reality of reason truth one of happiest of men situation indeed be more than commonly joyful have more than ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell heart raise spirit be released without reproach to from entanglement have long formed misery from woman whom have long ceased to loveand elevated at once to security with must have thought of almost with despair a soon a have learnt to consider with desire be brought not from doubt suspense from misery to happinessand change be openly spoken in such genuine flowing grateful cheerfulness a friend have never witnessed in before heart be now open to elinor weakness error confessed first boyish attachment to lucy treated with philosophic dignity of twenty four be foolish idle inclination on side said consequence of ignorance of world want of employment have mother given active profession when be removed at eighteen from care of mr pratt think nay be sure must never have happened for though left longstaple with what thought at time most unconquerable preference for niece yet have then have pursuit object to engage time keep at distance from for few month must very soon have outgrown fancied attachment especially by mixing more with world a in such case must have done instead of having thing to do instead of having profession chosen for being allowed to chuse returned home to be completely idle for first twelvemonth afterwards have not even nominal employment belonging to university must have given for be not entered at oxford till be nineteen have therefore nothing in world to do to fancy in love a mother did not make home in respect comfortable a have friend companion in brother disliked new acquaintance be not unnatural for to be very often at longstaple where always felt at home be always sure of welcome accordingly spent greatest part of time there from eighteen to nineteen lucy appeared everything be amiable obliging be pretty tooat least thought so then have seen so little of other woman must make comparison see defect considering everything therefore hope foolish a engagement be foolish a have since in way be proved be not at time unnatural inexcusable piece of folly change few hour have wrought in mind happiness of dashwoods be suchso greatas promised satisfaction of sleepless night mr dashwood too happy to be comfortable knew not how to love edward praise elinor enough how to be enough thankful for release without wounding delicacy how at once to give leisure for unrestrained conversation together yet enjoy a wished sight society of marianne must speak happiness only by tear comparison must occurregrets must arise joy though sincere a love for sister be of kind to give spirit language elinorhow be feeling to be described from moment of learning that lucy be married to edward be free to moment of justifying hope have so instantly followed be thing by turn tranquil when second moment have passed when found doubt solicitude removed compared situation with what so lately have beensaw honourably released from former engagementsaw instantly profiting by release to address declare affection a tender a constant a have ever supposed to beshe be oppressed be overcome by own felicity happily disposed a be human mind to be easily familiarized with change for better required several hour to give sedateness to spirit degree of tranquillity to heart edward be now fixed at cottage at least for weekfor other claim might be made on be impossible that le than week must be given up to enjoyment of elinors company suffice to say half be to be said of past present futurefor though very few hour spent in hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more subject than can really be in common between two rational creature yet with lover be different between subject be finished communication be even made till have be made at least twenty time over lucy marriage unceasing reasonable wonder among formed of course one of earliest discussion of loversand elinors particular knowledge of party made appear to in view a one of most extraordinary unaccountable circumstance have ever heard how must be thrown together by what attraction robert must be drawn on to marry girl of whose beauty have heard speak without admirationa girl too already engaged to brother on whose account that brother have be thrown off by familyit be beyond comprehension to make out to own heart be delightful affair to imagination be even ridiculous one to reason judgment be completely puzzle edward must only attempt explanation by supposing that perhaps at first accidentally meeting vanity of one have be so worked on by flattery of other a to lead by degree to rest elinor remembered what robert have told in harley street of opinion of what own mediation in brother affair might have done if applied to in time repeated to edward be exactly like robert be immediate observation that presently added might perhaps be in head when acquaintance between first began lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring good office in favour other design might afterward arise how long have be carrying on between however be equally at loss with to make out for at oxford where have remained for choice ever since quitting london have have mean of hearing of from letter to very last be neither le frequent le affectionate than usual not smallest suspicion therefore have ever occurred to prepare for what followedand when at last burst on in letter from lucy have be for time believed half stupified between wonder horror joy of such deliverance put letter into elinors hand dear sir being very sure have long lost affection have thought at liberty to bestow own on have doubt of being a happy with a once used to think might be with scorn to accept hand while heart be anothers sincerely wish happy in choice will not be fault if be not always good friend a near relationship now make proper can safely say owe ill will be sure will be too generous to do ill office brother have gained affection entirely a must not live without one be just returned from altar be now on way to dawlish for few week place dear brother have great curiosity to see thought must first trouble with few line will always remain sincere well wisher friend sister lucy ferrars have burnt letter will return picture first opportunity please to destroy scrawlsbut ring with hair be very welcome to keep elinor read returned without comment will not ask opinion of a composition said edwardfor world must not have have letter of hers seen by in former daysin sister be bad enough in wifehow have blushed over page of writingand believe may say that since first half year of foolishbusinessthis be only letter ever received from of substance made amends for defect of style however may have come about said elinor after pausethey be certainly married mother have brought on most appropriate punishment independence settled on robert through resentment against have put in power to make own choice have actually be bribing one son with thousand year to do very deed disinherited other for intending to do will hardly be le hurt suppose by robert marrying lucy than must have be by marrying will be more hurt by for robert always be favouriteshe will be more hurt by on same principle will forgive much sooner in what state affair stood at present between edward knew not for communication with of family have yet be attempted by have quitted oxford within four twenty hour after lucy letter arrived with only one object before nearest road to barton have have leisure to form scheme of conduct with road did not hold most intimate connection must hing till be assured of fate with miss dashwood by rapidity in seeking that fate be to be supposed in spite of jealousy with have once thought of colonel brandon in spite of modesty with rated own desert politeness with talked of doubt did not upon whole expect very cruel reception be business however to say that did said very prettily what might say on subject twelvemonth after must be referred to imagination of husband wife lucy have certainly meant to deceive to go off with flourish of malice against in message by thomas be perfectly clear to elinor edward now thoroughly enlightened on character have scruple in believing capable of utmost meanness of wanton ill nature though eye have be long opened even before acquaintance with elinor began to ignorance want of liberality in of opinionsthey have be equally imputed by to want of education till last letter reached have always believed to be well disposed good hearted girl thoroughly attached to nothing persuasion must have prevented putting end to engagement long before discovery of laid open to mother anger have be continual source of disquiet regret to thought duty said independent of feeling to give option of continuing engagement not when be renounced by mother stood to appearance without friend in world to assist in situation a where there seemed nothing to tempt avarice vanity of living creature how must suppose when so earnestly so warmly insisted on sharing fate whatever might be that thing most disinterested affection be inducement even now can not comprehend on motive acted what fancied advantage must be to to be fettered to man for whom have not smallest regard who have only two thousand pound in world must not foresee that colonel brandon must give living might suppose that something must occur in favour that own family might in time relent at rate lost nothing by continuing engagement for have proved that fettered inclination action connection be certainly respectable one probably gained consideration among friend if nothing more advantageous occurred must be better for to marry than be single edward be of course immediately convinced that nothing must have be more natural than lucy conduct more self evident than motive of elinor scolded harshly a lady always scold imprudence compliment for having spent so much time with at norland when must have felt own inconstancy behaviour be certainly very wrong said becauseto say nothing of own conviction relation be led away by to fancy expect what a be then situated must never be must only plead ignorance of own heart mistaken confidence in force of engagement be simple enough to think that because faith be plighted to there must be no danger in being with that consciousness of engagement be to keep heart a safe sacred a honour felt that admired told be only friendship till began to make comparison between lucy did not know how far be got after suppose be wrong in remaining so much in sussex argument with reconciled to expediency of be no better than thesethe danger be own be doing injury to anybody elinor smiled shook head edward heard with pleasure of colonel brandons being expected at cottage a really wished not only to be better acquainted with to have opportunity of convincing that no longer resented giving living of delafordwhich at present said after thanks so ungraciously delivered a mine be on occasion must think have never forgiven for offering now felt astonished that have never yet be to place so little interest have taken in matter that owed knowledge of house garden glebe extent of parish condition of land rate of tithe to elinor who have heard so much of from colonel brandon heard with so much attention a to be entirely mistress of subject one question after only remained undecided between one difficulty only be to be overcome be brought together by mutual affection with warmest approbation of real friend intimate knowledge of other seemed to make happiness certainand only wanted something to live upon edward have two thousand pound elinor one with delaford living be that must call own for be impossible that mr dashwood must advance anything be of quite enough in love to think that three hundred fifty pound year must supply with comfort of life edward be not entirely without hope of favourable change in mother towards on that rested for residue of income elinor have such dependence for since edward must still be unable to marry miss morton chusing have be spoken of in mr ferrarss flattering language a only lesser evil than chusing lucy steele feared that robert offence must serve other purpose than to enrich fanny about four day after edward arrival colonel brandon appeared to complete mr dashwoods satisfaction to give dignity of having for first time since living at barton more company with than house must hold edward be allowed to retain privilege of first comer colonel brandon therefore walked night to old quarter at park from whence usually returned in morning early enough to interrupt lover first tte tte before breakfast three week residence at delaford where in evening hour at least have little to do to calculate disproportion between thirty six seventeen brought to barton in temper of mind needed improvement in mariannes look kindness of welcome encouragement of mother language to make cheerful among such friend however such flattery did revive rumour of lucy marriage have yet reached himhe knew nothing of what have passed first hour of visit be consequently spent in hearing in wondering thing be explained to by mr dashwood found fresh reason to rejoice in what have done for mr ferrars since eventually promoted interest of elinor must be needle to say that gentleman advanced in good opinion of other a advanced in others acquaintance for must not be otherwise resemblance in good principle good sense in disposition manner of thinking must probably have be sufficient to unite in friendship without other attraction being in love with two sister two sister fond of other made that mutual regard inevitable immediate might otherwise have waited effect of time judgment letter from town few day before must have made nerve in elinors body thrill with transport now arrived to be read with le emotion than mirth mr jennings wrote to tell wonderful tale to vent honest indignation against jilting girl pour forth compassion towards poor mr edward who be sure have quite doted upon worthless hussy be now by account almost broken hearted at oxford do think continued nothing be ever carried on so sly for be two day before lucy called sat couple of hour with not soul suspected anything of matter not even nancy who poor soul came cry to day after in great fright for fear of mr ferrars a well a not knowing how to get to plymouth for lucy seems borrowed money before went off to be married on purpose suppose to make show with poor nancy have not seven shilling in world so be very glad to give five guinea to take down to exeter where think of staying three four week with mr burgess in hope a tell to fall in with doctor again must say that lucy crossness not to take along with in chaise be worse than poor mr edward can not get out of head must send for to barton miss marianne must try to comfort mr dashwoods strain be more solemn mr ferrars be most unfortunate of womenpoor fanny have suffered agony of sensibilityand considered existence of under blow with grateful wonder robert offence be unpardonable lucy be infinitely worse of be ever again to be mentioned to mr ferrars even if might hereafter be induced to forgive son wife must never be acknowledged a daughter be permitted to appear in presence secrecy with everything have be carried on between be rationally treated a enormously heightening crime because have suspicion of occurred to others proper measure must have be taken to prevent marriage called on elinor to join with in regretting that lucy engagement with edward have not rather be fulfilled than must thus be mean of spreading misery farther in family thus continued mr ferrars have never yet mentioned edward name doe not surprise to great astonishment not line have be received from on occasion perhaps however be kept silent by fear of offending will therefore give hint by line to oxford that sister think letter of proper submission from addressed perhaps to fanny by shown to mother might not be taken amiss for know tenderness of mr ferrarss heart that wish for nothing so much a to be on good term with child paragraph be of importance to prospect conduct of edward determined to attempt reconciliation though not exactly in manner pointed out by brother sister letter of proper submission repeated must have beg mother pardon for robert ingratitude to breach of honour to can make submission be grown humble penitent by what have passed be grown very happy must not interest know of submission be proper for to make may certainly ask to be forgiven said elinor because have offendedand must think might now venture so far a to profess concern for having ever formed engagement drew on mother anger agreed that might when

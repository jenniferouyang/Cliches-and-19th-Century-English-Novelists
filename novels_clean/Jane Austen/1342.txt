later be not published till only four year before death know whether in combination of fresh vigorous projection of youth critical revision of middle life there may be traced distinct superiority in

wickham by awkwardness arising with equal naturalness from gradual transformation of elizabeth own feeling from positive aversion to actual love know whether grasping hand of playwright have ever be laid upon pride prejudice dare say that if be situation must prove not startling garish enough for footlights character scheme too subtle delicate for pit gallery if attempt be made must certainly not be hampered by of looseness of construction sometimes disguised by convenience of novelist can avail appear at once on stage think however though thought will doubtless seem heretical to more than one school of critic that construction be not highest merit choicest gift of novelist set off other gift grace most advantageously to critical eye want of will sometimes mar grace appreciably though not quite consciously to eye by mean ultra critical very badly built novel excelled in pathetic humorous character displayed consummate command of dialogue perhaps rarest of faculty must be infinitely better thing than faultless plot acted told by puppet with pebble in mouth despite ability miss austen have shown in working out story for one must put pride prejudice far lower if did not contain what seem to very masterpiece of miss austen humour of faculty of character creation masterpiece who may indeed admit john thorpe eltons mr norris one two others to company who in one instance certainly perhaps in others be still superior to characteristic of miss austen humour be so subtle delicate that be perhaps at time easier to apprehend than to express at particular time likely to be differently apprehended by different person to humour seems to posse greater affinity on whole to of addison than to other of numerous specie of great british genus difference of scheme of time of subject of literary convention be of course obvious enough difference of sex doe not perhaps count for much for there be distinctly feminine element in mr spectator in jane austen genius there be though nothing mannish much that be masculine likeness of quality consists in great number of common subdivision of quality demureness extreme minuteness of touch avoidance of loud tone glaring effect also there be in certain not inhuman unamiable cruelty be custom with who judge grossly to contrast good nature of addison with savagery of swift mildness of miss austen with boisterousness of fielding smollett even with ferocious practical joke that immediate predecessor miss burney allowed without very much protest yet in mr addison in miss austen there be though restrained well mannered insatiable ruthless delight in roasting cutting up fool man in early eighteenth century of course must push taste further than lady in early nineteenth doubt miss austen principle a well a heart must have shrunk from such thing a letter from unfortunate husband in spectator who describes with gusto innocence in world how wife friend induce to play at blind man buff spectator letter of damsel of fourteen who wish to marry mr shapely assures selected mentor that admires spectator mightily might have be written by rather more ladylike intelligent lydia bennet in day of lydia great grandmother while on other hand think unreasonably have found cynicism in touch of miss austen own such a satire of mr musgroves self deceiving regret over son word cynical be one of most misused in english language especially when by glaring gratuitous falsification of original sense be applied not to rough snarling invective to gentle oblique satire if cynicism mean perception of other side sense of accepted hell beneath consciousness motif be nearly always mixed to seem be not identical with to be if be cynicism then man woman who be not fool who doe not care to live in fool paradise who have knowledge of nature world life be cynic in sense miss austen certainly be one may even have be one in further sense that like own mr bennet took epicurean delight in dissecting in displaying in setting at work fool mean person think did take delight think at worse of for a woman while be immensely better for a artist in respect of art generally mr goldwin smith have truly observed that metaphor have be exhausted in depicting perfection of combined with narrowness of field have justly added that need not go beyond own comparison to art of miniature painter to make latter observation quite exact must not use term miniature in restricted sense must think rather of memling at one end of history of painting meissonier at other than of cosway of kind be not so certain that must myself use word narrow in connection with if world be microcosm cosmic quality of be at least a eminent a littleness doe not touch what did not feel called to paint be not so sure that must not have painted what did not feel called to touch be at least remarkable that in two very short period of writing one of about three year of not much more than five executed six capital work have not left single failure be possible that romantic paste in composition be defective must always remember that hardly anybody born in decade that of eighteenth century seventy independently exhibited full romantic quality even scott required hill mountain ballad even coleridge metaphysics german to enable to chip classical shell miss austen be english girl brought up in country retirement at time when lady went back into house if there be white frost might pierce kid shoe when sudden cold be subject of gravest fear when study way conduct be subject to fantastic limit restriction against mary wollstonecraft

complete impression get none be lucky if discarding two third of what give can shape real impression out of rest with miss austen myriad trivial unforced stroke build up picture like magic nothing be false nothing be superfluous when to take present book only mr collins changed mind from jane to elizabeth while mr bennet be stirring fire know how mr bennet must have stirred fire when mr darcy brought coffee cup back touch in case be like of swift taller by breadth of nail impressed half reluctant thackeray with just outspoken admiration indeed fantastic a may seem must put miss austen a near to swift in way a have put to addison in others swiftian quality appears in present novel a appears nowhere else in character of immortal ineffable mr collins mr collins be really great far greater than anything addison ever did almost great enough for fielding for swift have be said that one ever be like in first place be like be there alive imperishable more real than hundred of prime

difference from other heroine of lively type seems to lie first in being distinctly clever almost strong minded in better sense of objectionable word secondly in being entirely destitute of ill nature

of distinguishing much superior solicitude of mr bingley must not make very favourable answer jane be by mean better sister on hearing repeated three four time how much be grieved how shocking be to have bad cold how excessively disliked being ill then thought more of matter indifference towards jane when not immediately before restored elizabeth to enjoyment of original dislike brother indeed be only one of party whom must regard with complacency anxiety for jane be evident attention to herself most pleasing prevented feeling so much intruder a believed be considered by others have very little notice from miss bingley be engrossed by mr darcy sister scarcely le so a for mr hurst by whom elizabeth sat be indolent man who lived only to eat drink play at card who when found prefer plain

impertinence have conversation style taste beauty mr hurst thought same added have nothing in short to recommend being excellent walker will never forget appearance morning really looked almost wild

inch deep in mud be absolutely certain gown have be let down to hide not doing office picture may be very exact louisa said bingley be lost upon thought elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when came into room morning dirty petticoat quite escaped notice observed mr darcy be sure said miss bingley be inclined to think that must not wish to see sister make such exhibition certainly not to walk three mile four mile five mile whatever be above ancles in dirt alone quite alone what must mean by seems to to show abominable sort of conceited independence most country town indifference to decorum show affection for sister be very pleasing said bingley be afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in half whisper that adventure have rather affected admiration of fine eye not at all replied be brightened by exercise short pause followed speech mr hurst began again have excessive regard for jane bennet be really very sweet girl wish with heart be well settled with father mother such low connection be afraid there be chance of think have heard say that uncle be attorney in meryton yes have who life somewhere near cheapside be capital added sister laughed heartily if have uncle enough to fill cheapside cried bingley must not make one jot le agreeable must very materially lessen chance of marrying men of consideration in world replied darcy to speech bingley made answer sister gave hearty assent indulged mirth for time at expense of dear friend vulgar relation with renewal of tenderness however repaired to room on leaving dining parlour sat with till summoned to coffee be still very poorly elizabeth must not quit at till late in evening when have comfort of seeing asleep when appeared to rather right than pleasant that must go down stair on entering drawing room found whole party at loo be immediately invited to join suspecting to be playing high declined making sister excuse said must amuse for short time must stay below with book mr hurst looked at with astonishment do prefer reading to card said be rather singular miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises card be great reader have pleasure in anything else deserve such praise such censure cried elizabeth be not great reader have pleasure in many thing in nursing sister be sure have pleasure said bingley hope will soon be increased by seeing quite well elizabeth thanked from heart then walked towards table where few book be lying immediately offered to fetch others that library afforded wish collection be larger for benefit own credit be idle fellow though have not many have more than ever looked into elizabeth assured that must suit perfectly with in room be astonished said miss bingley that father must have left so small collection of book what delightful library have at pemberley mr darcy ought to be good replied have be work of many generation then have added so much to be always buying book can not comprehend neglect of family library in such day a neglect be sure neglect nothing can add to beauty of noble place charles when build house wish may be half a delightful a pemberley wish may must really advise to make purchase in neighbourhood take pemberley for kind of model there be not finer county in england than derbyshire with heart will buy pemberley if darcy will sell be talking of possibility charles upon word caroline must think more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation elizabeth be so much caught by what passed a to leave very little attention for book soon laying wholly aside drew near card table stationed between mr bingley eldest sister to observe game be miss darcy much grown since spring said miss bingley will be a tall a be think will be now about miss elizabeth bennet height rather taller how long to see again never met with anybody who

accomplished a be young lady accomplished dear charles what do mean yes of think paint table cover screen net purse scarcely know one who can not do be sure never heard young lady spoken of for first time without being informed that be very accomplished list of common extent of accomplishment said darcy have too much truth word be applied to many woman who deserves otherwise than by netting purse covering screen be very far from agreeing with in estimation of lady in general can not boast of knowing more than dozen in whole range of acquaintance be really accomplished be sure said miss bingley then observed must comprehend great deal in idea of accomplished woman yes do comprehend great deal in oh certainly cried faithful assistant one can be really esteemed accomplished who doe not greatly surpass what be usually met with woman must have thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing modern language to deserve word besides must posse certain something in air manner of walking tone of voice address expression word will be deserved must posse added darcy to must yet add something more substantial in improvement of mind by extensive reading be no longer surprised at knowing only six accomplished woman rather wonder now at knowing be so severe upon own sex a to doubt possibility of never saw such woman never saw such capacity taste application elegance a describe united mr hurst miss bingley cried out against injustice of implied doubt be protesting that knew many woman who answered description when mr hurst called to order with bitter complaint of inattention to what be going forward a conversation be thereby at end elizabeth soon afterwards left room eliza bennet said miss bingley when door be closed on be one of young lady who seek to recommend to other sex by undervaluing own with many men daresay succeeds in opinion be paltry device very mean art undoubtedly replied darcy to whom remark be chiefly addressed there be meanness in art lady sometimes condescend to employ for captivation bear affinity to cunning be despicable miss bingley be not so entirely satisfied with reply a to continue subject elizabeth joined again only to say that sister be worse that must not leave bingley urged mr jones being sent for immediately while sister convinced that country advice must be of service recommended express to town for one of most eminent physician must not hear of be not so unwilling to comply with brother proposal be settled that mr jones must be sent for early in morning if miss bennet be not decidedly better bingley be quite uncomfortable sister declared that be miserable solaced wretchedness however by duet after supper while must find better relief to feeling than by giving housekeeper direction possible attention might be paid to sick lady sister illustration mr bennet two youngest girl copyright by george allen chapter ix illustration elizabeth passed chief of night in sister room in morning have pleasure of being able to send tolerable answer to inquiry very early received from mr bingley by housemaid time afterwards from two elegant lady who waited on sister in spite of amendment however requested to have note sent to longbourn desiring mother to visit jane form own judgment of situation note be immediately despatched content a quickly complied with mr bennet accompanied by two youngest girl reached netherfield soon after family breakfast have found jane in apparent danger mr bennet must have be very miserable being satisfied on seeing that illness be not alarming have wish of recovering immediately a restoration to health must probably remove from netherfield must not listen therefore to daughter proposal of being carried home did apothecary who arrived about same time think at advisable after sitting little while with jane on miss bingleys appearance invitation mother three daughter attended into breakfast parlour bingley met with hope mr bennet have not found miss bennet worse than expected indeed have sir be answer be great deal too ill to be moved mr jones say must not think of moving must trespass little longer on kindness removed cried bingley must not be thought of sister be sure will not hear of removal may depend upon madam said miss bingley with cold civility miss bennet will receive possible attention while remains with mr bennet be profuse in acknowledgment be

sweetest temper ever met with often tell other girl be nothing to have sweet room here mr bingley charming prospect over gravel walk know place in country be equal to netherfield will not think of quitting in hurry hope though have short lease do be done in hurry replied therefore if must resolve to quit netherfield must probably be off in five minute at present however consider a quite fixed here be exactly what must have supposed of said elizabeth begin to comprehend do cried turning towards oh yes understand perfectly wish might take for compliment to be so easily seen through be afraid be pitiful be a happens doe not necessarily follow that deep intricate character be more le estimable than one a yours lizzy cried mother remember where be run on in wild manner that be suffered to do at home did not know before continued bingley immediately that be studier of character must be amusing study yes intricate character be most amusing have at least advantage country said darcy can in general supply few subject for study in country neighbourhood move in very confined unvarying society people alter so much that there be something new to be observed in for ever yes indeed cried mr bennet offended by manner of mentioning country neighbourhood assure there be quite a much of going on in country a in town everybody be surprised darcy after looking at for moment turned silently away mr bennet who fancied have gained complete victory over continued triumph can not see that london have great advantage over country for part except shop public place country be vast deal pleasanter be not mr bingley when be in country replied never wish to leave when be in town be pretty much same have advantage can be equally happy in ay be because have right disposition that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think country be nothing at indeed mamma be mistaken said elizabeth blushing for mother quite mistook mr darcy only meant that there be not such variety of people to be met with in country a in town must acknowledge to be true certainly dear nobody said there be a to not meeting with many people in neighbourhood believe there be few neighbourhood larger know dine with four twenty family nothing concern for elizabeth must enable bingley to keep countenance sister be le delicate directed eye towards mr darcy with very expressive smile elizabeth for sake of saying something might turn mother thought now asked if charlotte lucas have be at longbourn since coming away yes called yesterday with father what agreeable man sir william be mr bingley be not so much man of fashion so genteel so easy have always something to say to everybody be idea of good breeding person who fancy very important never open mouth quite mistake matter did charlotte dine with

be pity be not handsome not that think charlotte so very plain then be particular friend seems very pleasant young woman said bingley oh dear yes must own be very plain lady lucas have often said so envied janes beauty like to boast of own child to be sure jane one doe not often see anybody better looking be what everybody say trust own partiality when be only fifteen there be gentleman at brother gardiner in town so much in love with sister in law be sure must make offer before came away however did not perhaps thought too young however wrote verse on very pretty be so ended affection said elizabeth impatiently there have be many one fancy overcome in same way wonder who first discovered efficacy of poetry in driving away love have be used to consider poetry a food of love said darcy of fine stout healthy love may everything nourishes what be strong already if be only slight thin sort of inclination be convinced that one good sonnet will starve entirely away darcy only smiled general pause ensued made elizabeth tremble lest mother must be exposing again longed to speak must think of nothing to say after short silence mr bennet began repeating thanks to mr bingley for kindness to jane with apology for troubling also with lizzy mr bingley be unaffectedly civil in answer forced younger sister to be civil also say what occasion required performed part indeed without much graciousness mr bennet be satisfied soon afterwards ordered carriage upon signal youngest of daughter put forward two girl have be whispering to other during whole visit result of be that youngest must tax mr bingley with having promised on first coming into country to give ball at netherfield lydia be stout well grown girl of fifteen with fine complexion good humoured countenance favourite with mother whose affection have brought into public at early age have high animal spirit sort of natural self consequence attention of officer to whom uncle good dinner own easy manner recommended have increased into assurance be very equal therefore to address mr bingley on subject of ball abruptly reminded of promise adding that must be most shameful thing in world if did not keep answer to sudden attack be delightful to mother ear be perfectly ready assure to keep engagement when sister be recovered will if please name very day of ball must not wish to be dancing while be ill lydia declared satisfied oh yes must be much better to wait till jane be well by time most likely captain carter must be at meryton again when have given ball added will insist on giving one also will tell colonel forster will be quite shame if doe not mr bennet daughter then departed elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving own relation behaviour to remark of two lady mr darcy latter of whom however must not be prevailed on to join in censure of in spite of miss bingleys witticism on fine eye illustration chapter x illustration day passed much a day before have done mr hurst miss bingley have spent hour of morning with invalid who continued though slowly to mend in evening elizabeth joined party in drawing room loo table however did not appear mr darcy be writing miss bingley seated

amused in attending to what passed between darcy companion perpetual commendation of lady on hand writing on evenness of line on length of letter with perfect unconcern with praise be received formed curious dialogue be exactly in unison with opinion of how delighted miss darcy will be to receive letter made answer write uncommonly fast be mistaken write rather slowly how many letter must have occasion to write in course of year letter of business too how odious must think be fortunate then that fall to lot instead of to yours pray tell sister long to see have already told so once by desire be afraid like pen let mend for mend pen remarkably well thank always mend own how can contrive to write so even be silent tell sister be delighted to hear of improvement on harp pray let know be quite in rapture with beautiful little design for table think infinitely superior to miss grantleys will give leave to defer rapture till write again at present have not room to do justice oh be of consequence will see in january do always write such charming long letter to mr darcy be generally long whether always charming be not for to determine be rule with that person who can write long letter with ease can not write ill will not do for compliment to darcy caroline cried brother because doe not write with ease study too much for word of four syllable darcy style of writing be very different from yours oh cried miss bingley charles writes in most careless way imaginable leaf out word blot rest idea flow so rapidly have not time to express by mean letter sometimes convey idea at to correspondent humility mr bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof nothing be more deceitful said darcy than appearance of humility be often only carelessness of opinion sometimes indirect boast of two do call little recent piece of modesty indirect boast for be really proud of defect in writing because consider a proceeding from rapidity of thought carelessness of execution if not estimable think at least highly interesting power of doing anything with quickness be always much prized by possessor often without attention to imperfection of performance when told mr bennet morning that if ever resolved on quitting netherfield must be gone in five minute meant to be sort of panegyric of compliment to yet what be there so very laudable in precipitance must leave very necessary business undone can be of real advantage to anyone else nay cried bingley be too much to remember at night foolish thing be said in morning yet upon honour believed what said of to be true believe at moment at least therefore did not assume character of needle precipitance merely to show off before lady daresay believed be by mean convinced that must be gone with such celerity conduct must be quite a dependent on chance a of man know if a be mounting horse friend be to say bingley have better stay till next week must probably do must probably not go at word might stay month have only proved by

dance to have mr collins instead liveliness have be never worse timed there be help for however mr wickhams happiness own be perforce delayed little longer mr collins proposal accepted with a good grace a must be not better pleased with gallantry from idea suggested of something more now first struck that be selected from among sister a worthy of being mistress of hunsford parsonage of assisting to form quadrille table at rosings in absence of more eligible visitor idea soon reached to conviction a observed increasing civility towards heard frequent attempt at compliment on wit vivacity though more astonished than gratified herself by effect of charm be not long before mother gave to understand that probability of marriage be exceedingly agreeable to elizabeth however did not choose to take hint being well aware that serious dispute must be consequence of reply mr collins might never make offer till did be useless to quarrel about if there have not be netherfield ball

denny to whom lydia eagerly applied who told that wickham have be obliged to go to town on business day before be not yet returned adding with significant smile imagine business must have called away just now if have not wished to avoid certain gentleman here part of intelligence though unheard by lydia be caught by elizabeth a assured that darcy be not le answerable for wickhams absence than if first surmise have be just feeling of displeasure against former be so sharpened by immediate disappointment that must hardly reply with tolerable civility to polite inquiry directly afterwards approached to make attention forbearance patience with darcy be injury to wickham be resolved against sort of conversation with turned away with degree of ill humour must not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr bingley whose blind partiality provoked elizabeth be not formed for ill humour though prospect of own be destroyed for evening must not dwell long on spirit having told grief to

of mind charlotte tried to console dare say will find very agreeable heaven forbid must be greatest misfortune of to find man agreeable whom one be determined to hate wish such evil when dancing recommenced however darcy approached to claim hand charlotte must not help cautioning in whisper not to be simpleton allow fancy for wickham to make appear unpleasant in eye of man often time consequence elizabeth made answer took place in set amazed at dignity to be arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy reading in neighbour look equal amazement in beholding stood for time without speaking word began to imagine that silence be to last through two dance at first be resolved not to break till suddenly fancying that must be greater punishment to partner to oblige to talk made slight observation on dance replied be again silent after pause of minute addressed second time with be turn to say something now mr darcy talked about dance ought to make kind of remark on size of room number of couple smiled assured that wished to say must be said very well that reply will do for present perhaps by by may observe private ball be much pleasanter than public one now may be silent do talk by rule then while be dancing sometimes one must speak little know must look odd to be entirely silent for hour together yet for advantage of conversation ought to be so arranged a that may have trouble of saying a little a possible be consulting own feeling in present case do imagine that be gratifying mine replied elizabeth archly for have always seen great similarity in turn of mind be of unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless expect to say something will amaze whole room be handed down to posterity with clat of proverb be very striking resemblance of own character be sure said how near may be to mine can not pretend to say think faithful portrait undoubtedly must not decide on own performance made answer be again silent till have gone down dance when asked if sister did not very often walk to meryton answered in affirmative unable to resist temptation added when met there other day have just be forming new acquaintance effect be immediate deeper shade of hauteur overspread feature said not word elizabeth though blaming for own weakness must not go on at length darcy spoke in constrained manner said mr wickham be blessed with such happy manner a may insure making friend whether may be equally capable of retaining be le certain have be so unlucky a to lose friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis in manner be likely to suffer from life darcy made answer seemed desirous of changing subject at moment sir william lucas appeared close to meaning to pas through set to other side of room on perceiving mr darcy stopped with bow of superior courtesy to compliment on dancing partner have be most highly gratified indeed dear sir such very superior dancing be not often seen be evident that belong to first circle allow to say however that fair partner doe not disgrace must hope to have pleasure often repeated especially when certain desirable event dear miss eliza glancing at sister bingley will take place what congratulation will then flow in appeal to mr darcy let not interrupt sir will not thank for detaining from bewitching converse of young lady whose bright eye be also upbraiding illustration such very superior dancing be not often seen copyright by george allen latter part of address be scarcely heard by darcy sir williams allusion to friend seemed to strike forcibly eye be directed with very serious expression towards bingley jane who be dancing together recovering however shortly turned to partner said sir williams interruption have made forget what be talking of think be speaking at sir william must not have interrupted two people in room who have le to say for have tried two three subject already without success what be to talk of next can not imagine what think of book said smiling book oh be sure never read same not with same feeling be sorry think so if be case there can at least be want of subject may compare different opinion can not talk of book in ball room head be always full of something else present always occupies in such scene doe said with look of doubt yes always replied without knowing what said for thought have wandered far from subject a soon afterwards appeared by suddenly exclaiming remember hearing once say mr darcy that hardly ever forgave that resentment once created be unappeasable be very cautious suppose a to being created be said with firm voice never allow to be blinded by prejudice hope not be particularly incumbent on who never change opinion to be secure of judging properly at first may ask to what question tend merely to illustration of character said endeavouring to shake off gravity be trying to make out what be success shook head get on at hear such different account of a puzzle exceedingly can readily believe answered gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to must wish miss bennet that be not to sketch character at present moment a there be reason to fear that performance must reflect credit on if take likeness now may never have opportunity must by mean suspend pleasure of yours coldly replied said more went down other dance parted in silence on side dissatisfied though not to equal degree for in darcys breast there be tolerably powerful feeling towards soon procured pardon directed anger against have not long separated when miss bingley came towards with expression of civil disdain thus accosted so miss eliza hear be quite delighted with george wickham sister have be talking to about asking thousand question find that young man forgot to tell among other communication that be son of old wickham late mr darcys steward let recommend however a friend not to give implicit confidence to assertion for a to mr darcys using ill be perfectly false for on contrary have be always remarkably kind to though george wickham have treated mr darcy in most infamous manner know particular know very well that mr darcy be not in least to blame that can not bear to hear george wickham mentioned that though brother thought must not well avoid including in invitation to officer be excessively glad to find that have taken out of way coming into country at be most insolent thing indeed wonder how must presume to do pity miss eliza for discovery of favourite guilt really considering descent one must not expect much better guilt descent appear by account to be same said elizabeth angrily for have heard accuse of nothing worse than of being son of mr darcys steward of can assure informed beg pardon replied miss bingley turning away with sneer excuse interference be kindly meant insolent girl said elizabeth to herself be much mistaken if expect to influence by paltry attack a see nothing in own wilful ignorance malice of mr darcy then sought eldest sister who have undertaken to make inquiry on same subject of bingley jane met with smile of such sweet complacency glow of such happy expression a sufficiently marked how well be satisfied with occurrence of evening elizabeth instantly read feeling at moment solicitude for wickham resentment against enemy everything else gave way before hope of janes being in fairest way for happiness want to know said with countenance no le smiling than sister what have learnt about mr wickham perhaps have be too pleasantly engaged to think of third person in case may be sure of pardon replied jane have not forgotten have nothing satisfactory to tell mr bingley doe not know whole of history be quite ignorant of circumstance have principally offended mr darcy will vouch for good conduct probity honour of friend be perfectly convinced that mr wickham have deserved much le attention from mr darcy than have received be sorry to say that by account a well a sister mr wickham be by mean respectable young man be afraid have be very imprudent have deserved to lose mr darcys regard mr bingley doe not know mr wickham no never saw till other morning at meryton account then be what have received from mr darcy be perfectly satisfied what doe say of living doe not exactly recollect circumstance though have heard from mr darcy more than once belief that be left to conditionally only have not doubt of mr bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmly must excuse not being convinced by assurance only mr bingleys defence of friend be very able one dare say since be unacquainted with several part of story have learnt rest from friend will venture still to think of gentleman a did before then changed discourse to one more gratifying to on there must be difference of sentiment elizabeth listened with delight to happy though modest hope jane entertained of bingleys regard said in power to heighten confidence in on being joined by mr bingley elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after pleasantness of last partner have scarcely replied before mr collins came up to told with great exultation that have just be so fortunate a to make most important discovery have found out said by singular accident that there be now in room near relation to patroness happened to overhear gentleman mentioning to young lady who doe honour of house name of cousin miss de bourgh of mother lady catherine how wonderfully sort of thing occur who must have thought of meeting with perhaps nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in assembly be most thankful that discovery be made in time for to pay respect to be now going to do trust will excuse not having done before total ignorance of connection must plead apology be not going to introduce to mr darcy indeed be will entreat pardon for not having done earlier believe to be lady catherine nephew will be in power to assure that ladyship be quite well yesterday sennight elizabeth tried hard to dissuade from scheme assuring that mr darcy must consider addressing without introduction a impertinent freedom rather than compliment to aunt that be not in least necessary there must be notice on side that if be must belong to mr darcy superior in consequence to begin acquaintance mr collins listened to with determined air of following own inclination when ceased speaking replied thus dear miss elizabeth have highest opinion in world of excellent judgment in matter within scope of understanding permit to say that there must be wide difference between established form of ceremony amongst laity regulate clergy for give leave to observe consider clerical office a equal in point of dignity with highest rank in kingdom provided that proper humility of behaviour be at same time maintained must therefore allow to follow dictate of conscience on occasion lead to perform what look on a point of duty pardon for neglecting to profit by advice on other subject will be constant guide though in case before consider more fitted by education habitual study to decide on what be right than young lady like with low bow left to attack mr darcy whose reception of advance eagerly watched whose astonishment at being so addressed be very evident cousin prefaced speech with solemn bow though must not hear word of felt a if hearing saw in motion of lip word apology hunsford lady catherine de bourgh vexed to see expose to man mr darcy be eyeing with unrestrained wonder when at last mr collins allowed to speak replied with air of distant civility mr collins however be not discouraged from speaking again mr darcys contempt seemed abundantly increasing with length of second speech at end of only made slight bow moved way mr collins then returned to elizabeth have reason assure said to be dissatisfied with reception mr darcy seemed much pleased with attention answered with utmost civility even paid compliment of saying that be so well convinced of lady catherine discernment a to be certain must never bestow favour unworthily be really very handsome thought upon whole be much pleased with a elizabeth have longer interest of own to pursue turned attention almost entirely on sister mr bingley train of agreeable reflection observation gave birth to made perhaps almost a happy a jane saw in idea settled in very house in felicity marriage of true affection must bestow felt capable under such circumstance of endeavouring even to like bingleys two sister mother thought plainly saw be bent same way determined not to venture near lest might hear too much when sat down to supper therefore considered most unlucky perverseness placed within one of other deeply be vexed to find that mother be talking to one person lady lucas freely openly of nothing else of expectation that jane must be soon married to mr bingley be animating subject mr bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating advantage of match being such charming young man so rich living three mile from be first point of self gratulation then be such comfort to think how fond two sister be of jane to be certain that must desire connection a much a must do be moreover such promising thing for younger daughter a janes marrying so greatly must throw in way of other rich men lastly be so pleasant at time of life to be able to consign single daughter to care of sister that might not be obliged to go into company more than liked be necessary to make circumstance matter of pleasure because on such occasion be etiquette one be le likely than mr bennet to find comfort in staying at home at period of life concluded with many good wish lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently triumphantly believing there be chance of in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check rapidity of mother word persuade to describe felicity in le audible whisper for to inexpressible vexation must perceive that chief of be overheard by mr darcy who sat opposite to mother only scolded for being nonsensical what be mr darcy to pray must be afraid of be sure owe such particular civility a to be obliged to say nothing may not like to hear for heaven sake madam speak lower what advantage can be to to offend mr darcy will never recommend to friend by so doing nothing that must say however have influence mother must talk of view in same intelligible tone elizabeth blushed blushed again with shame vexation must not help frequently glancing eye at mr darcy though glance convinced of what dreaded for though be not always looking at mother be convinced that attention be invariably fixed by expression of face changed gradually from indignant contempt to composed steady gravity at length however mr bennet have more to say lady lucas who have be long yawning at repetition of delight saw likelihood of sharing be left to comfort of cold ham chicken elizabeth now began to revive not long be interval of tranquillity for when supper be over singing be talked of have mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige company by many significant look silent entreaty did endeavour to prevent such proof of complaisance in vain mary must not understand opportunity of exhibiting be delightful to began song elizabeth eye be fixed on with most painful sensation watched progress through several stanza with impatience be very ill rewarded at close for mary on receiving amongst thanks of table hint of hope that might be prevailed on to favour again after pause of minute began mary power be by mean fitted for such display voice be weak manner affected elizabeth be in agony looked at jane to see how bore jane be very composedly talking to bingley looked at two sister saw making sign of derision at other at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave looked at father to entreat interference lest mary must be singing night took hint when mary have finished second song said aloud will do extremely well child have delighted long enough let other young lady have time to exhibit mary though pretending not to hear be somewhat disconcerted elizabeth sorry for sorry for father speech be afraid anxiety have done no good others of party be now applied to if said mr collins be so fortunate a to be able to sing must have great pleasure be sure in obliging company with air for consider music a very innocent diversion perfectly compatible with profession of clergyman mean however to assert that can be justified in devoting too much of time to music for there be certainly other thing to be attended to rector of parish have much to do in first place must make such agreement for tithe a may be beneficial to not offensive to patron must write own sermon time remains will not be too much for parish duty care improvement of dwelling can not be excused from making a comfortable a possible think of light importance that must have attentive conciliatory manner towards everybody especially towards to whom owes preferment can not acquit of duty must think well of man who must omit occasion of testifying respect towards anybody connected with family with bow to mr darcy concluded speech have be spoken so loud a to be heard by room many stared many smiled one looked more amused than mr bennet while wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly observed in half whisper to lady lucas that be remarkably clever good kind of young man to elizabeth appeared that have family made agreement to expose a much a must during evening must have be impossible for to play part with more spirit finer success happy did think for bingley sister that of exhibition have escaped notice that feeling be not of sort to be much distressed by folly must have witnessed that two sister mr darcy however must have opportunity of ridiculing relation be bad enough must not determine whether silent contempt of gentleman insolent smile of lady be more intolerable rest of evening brought little amusement be teased by mr collins who continued most perseveringly by side though must not prevail with to dance with again put out of power to dance with others in vain did entreat to stand up with somebody else offered to introduce to young lady in room assured that a to dancing be perfectly indifferent to that chief object be by delicate attention to recommend to that must therefore make point of remaining close to whole evening there be arguing upon project owed greatest relief to friend miss lucas who often joined good naturedly engaged mr collins conversation to herself be at least free from offence of mr darcys further notice though often standing within very short distance of quite disengaged never came near enough to speak felt to be probable consequence of allusion to mr wickham rejoiced in longbourn party be last of company to depart by manuvre of mr bennet have to wait for carriage quarter of hour after everybody else be gone gave time to see how heartily be wished away by of family mr hurst sister scarcely opened mouth except to complain of fatigue be evidently impatient to have house to repulsed attempt of mr bennet at conversation by so doing threw languor over whole party be very little relieved by long speech of mr collins who be complimenting mr bingley sister on elegance of entertainment hospitality politeness have marked behaviour to guest darcy said nothing at mr bennet in equal silence be enjoying scene mr bingley jane be standing together little detached from rest talked only to other elizabeth preserved a steady silence a mr hurst miss bingley even lydia be too much fatigued to utter more than occasional exclamation of lord how tired be accompanied by violent yawn when at length arose to take leave mr bennet be most pressingly civil in hope of seeing whole family soon at longbourn addressed particularly to mr bingley to assure how happy must make by eating family dinner with at time without ceremony of formal invitation bingley be grateful pleasure readily engaged for taking earliest opportunity of waiting on after return from london whither be obliged to go next day for short time mr bennet be perfectly satisfied quitted house under delightful persuasion that allowing for necessary preparation of settlement new carriage wedding clothes must undoubtedly see daughter settled at netherfield in course of three four month of having daughter married to mr collins thought with equal certainty with considerable though not equal pleasure elizabeth be least dear to of child though man match be quite good enough for worth of be eclipsed by mr bingley netherfield illustration to assure in most animated language chapter xix illustration next day opened new scene at longbourn mr collins made declaration in form having resolved to do without loss of time a leave of absence extended only to following saturday having feeling of diffidence to make distressing to even at moment set about in very orderly manner with observance supposed regular part of business on finding mr bennet elizabeth one of younger girl together soon after breakfast addressed mother in word may hope madam for interest with fair daughter elizabeth when solicit for honour of private audience with in course of morning before elizabeth have time for anything blush of surprise mr bennet instantly answered oh dear yes certainly be sure lizzy will be very happy be sure can have objection come kitty want upstairs gathering work together be hastening away when elizabeth called out dear maam go beg will not go mr collins must excuse can have nothing to say to that anybody need not hear be going away nonsense lizzy desire will stay where be upon elizabeth seeming really with vexed embarrassed look about to escape added lizzy insist upon staying hearing mr collins elizabeth must not oppose such injunction moment consideration making also sensible that must be wisest to get over a soon a quietly a possible sat down again tried to conceal by incessant employment feeling be divided between distress diversion mr bennet kitty walked off a soon a be gone mr collins began believe dear miss elizabeth that modesty so far from doing disservice rather add to other perfection must have be le amiable in eye have there not be little unwillingness allow to assure have respected mother permission for address can hardly doubt purport of discourse however natural delicacy may lead to dissemble attention have be too marked to be mistaken almost a soon a entered house singled out a companion of future life before be run away with by feeling on subject perhaps will be advisable for to state reason for marrying moreover for coming into hertfordshire with design of selecting wife a certainly did idea of mr collins with solemn composure being run away with by feeling made elizabeth so near laughing that must not use short pause allowed in attempt to stop farther continued reason for marrying be first that think right thing for clergyman in easy circumstance like to set example of matrimony in parish secondly that be convinced will add very greatly to happiness thirdly perhaps ought to have mentioned earlier that be particular advice recommendation of very noble lady whom have honour of calling patroness twice have condescended to give opinion unasked too on subject be very saturday night before left hunsford between pool at quadrille while mr jenkinson be arranging miss de bourghs footstool that said mr collins must marry clergyman like must marry choose properly choose gentlewoman for sake for own let be active useful sort of person not brought up high able to make small income go good way be advice find such woman a soon a can bring to hunsford will visit allow by way to observe fair cousin reckon notice kindness of lady catherine de bourgh a among least of advantage in power to offer will find manner beyond anything can describe wit vivacity think must be acceptable to especially when tempered with silence respect rank will inevitably excite thus much for general intention in favour of matrimony remains to be told why view be directed to longbourn instead of own neighbourhood where assure there be many amiable young woman fact be being a be to inherit estate after death of honoured father who however may live many year longer must not satisfy without resolving to choose wife from among daughter that loss to might be a little a possible when melancholy event take place however a have already said may not be for several year have be motive fair cousin flatter will not sink in esteem now nothing remains for to assure in most animated language of violence of affection to fortune be perfectly indifferent will make demand of nature on father since be well aware that must not be complied with that one thousand pound in per cent will not be yours till after mother decease be that may ever be entitled to on head therefore will be uniformly silent may assure that ungenerous reproach will ever pas lip when be married be absolutely necessary to interrupt now be too hasty sir cried forget have made answer let do without further loss of time accept thanks for compliment be paying be very sensible of honour of proposal be impossible for to do otherwise than decline be not now to learn replied mr collins with formal wave of hand that be usual with young lady to reject address of man whom secretly mean to accept when first applies for favour that sometimes refusal be repeated second even third time be therefore by mean discouraged by what have just said will hope to lead to altar ere long upon word sir cried elizabeth hope be rather extraordinary one after declaration do assure that be not one of young lady if such young lady there be who be so daring a to risk happiness on chance of being asked second time be perfectly serious in refusal must not make happy be convinced that be last woman in world who must make so nay be friend lady catherine to know be persuaded must find in respect ill qualified for situation be certain that lady catherine must think so said mr collins very gravely can not imagine that ladyship must at disapprove of may be certain that when have honour of seeing again will speak in highest term of modesty economy other amiable qualification indeed mr collins praise of will be unnecessary must give leave to judge for pay compliment of believing what say wish very happy very rich by refusing hand do in power to prevent being

miss bingley that might have be just a likely to marry have be relation lady catherine continued remark on elizabeth performance mixing with many instruction on execution taste elizabeth received with forbearance of civility at request of gentleman remained at instrument till ladyship carriage be ready to take home illustration chapter xxxii illustration elizabeth be sitting by next morning writing to jane while mr collins maria be gone on business into village when be startled by ring at door certain signal of visitor a have heard carriage thought not unlikely to be lady catherine under apprehension be putting away half finished letter that might escape impertinent question when door opened to very great surprise mr darcy mr darcy only entered room seemed astonished too on finding alone apologized for intrusion by letting know that have understood lady to be within then sat down when inquiry after rosings be made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence be absolutely necessary therefore to think of something in emergency recollecting when have seen last in hertfordshire feeling curious to know what must say on subject of hasty departure observed how very suddenly quitted netherfield last november mr darcy must have be most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see after so soon for if recollect right went day before sister be well hope when left perfectly so thank found that be to receive other answer after short pause added think have understood that mr bingley have not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again have never heard say so be probable that may spend very little of time there in future have many friend be at time of life when friend engagement be continually increasing if mean to be little at netherfield must be better for neighbourhood that must give up place entirely for then might possibly get settled family there perhaps mr bingley did not take house so much for convenience of neighbourhood a for own must expect to keep quit on same principle must not be surprised said darcy if be to give up a soon a eligible purchase offer elizabeth made answer be afraid of talking longer of friend having nothing else to say be now determined to leave trouble of finding subject to took hint soon began with seems very comfortable house lady catherine believe did great deal to when mr collins first came to hunsford believe did be sure must not have bestowed kindness on more grateful object mr collins appears very fortunate in choice of wife yes indeed friend may well rejoice in having met with one of very few sensible woman who must have accepted have made happy if have friend have excellent understanding though be not certain that consider marrying mr collins a wisest thing ever did seems perfectly happy however in prudential light be certainly very good match for must be very agreeable to to be settled within so easy distance of own family friend easy distance do call be nearly fifty mile what be fifty mile of good road little more than day journey yes call very easy distance must never have considered distance a one of advantage of match cried elizabeth must never have said mr collins be settled near family be proof of own attachment to hertfordshire anything beyond very neighbourhood of longbourn suppose must appear far a spoke there be sort of smile elizabeth fancied understood must be supposing to be thinking of jane netherfield blushed a answered mean to say that woman may not be settled too near family far near must be relative depend on many varying circumstance where there be fortune to make expense of travelling unimportant distance becomes evil be not case here mr mr collins have comfortable income not one a will allow of frequent journey be persuaded friend must not call near family under le than present distance mr darcy drew chair little towards said can not have right to such very strong local attachment can not have be always at longbourn elizabeth looked surprised gentleman experienced change of feeling drew back chair took newspaper from table glancing over said in colder voice be pleased with kent short dialogue on subject of country ensued on side calm concise soon put end to by entrance of charlotte sister just returned from walk tte tte surprised mr darcy related mistake have occasioned intruding on miss bennet after sitting few minute longer without saying much to anybody went away illustration accompanied by aunt copyright by george allen what can be meaning of said charlotte a soon a be gone dear eliza must be in love with must never have called on in familiar way when elizabeth told of silence did not seem very likely even to charlotte wish to be case after various conjecture must at last only suppose visit to proceed from difficulty of finding anything to do be more probable from time of year field sport be over within door there be lady catherine book billiard table gentleman can not be always within door in nearness of parsonage pleasantness of walk to of people who lived in two cousin found temptation from period of walking thither almost day called at various time of morning sometimes separately sometimes together now then accompanied by aunt be plain to colonel fitzwilliam came because have pleasure in society persuasion of course recommended still more elizabeth be reminded by own satisfaction in being with a well a by evident admiration of former favourite george wickham though in comparing saw there be le captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams manner believed might have best informed mind why mr darcy came so often to parsonage be more difficult to understand must not be for society a frequently sat there ten minute together without opening lip when did speak seemed effect of necessity rather than of choice sacrifice to propriety not pleasure to seldom appeared really animated mr collins knew not what to make of colonel fitzwilliams occasionally laughing at stupidity proved that be generally different own knowledge of must not have told a must have liked to believe change effect of love object of love friend eliza set seriously to work to find out watched whenever be at rosings whenever came to hunsford without much success certainly looked at friend great deal expression of look be disputable be earnest steadfast gaze often doubted whether there be much admiration in sometimes seemed nothing absence of mind have once twice suggested to elizabeth possibility of being partial to elizabeth always laughed at idea mr collins did not think right to press subject from danger of raising expectation might only end in disappointment for in opinion admitted not of doubt that friend dislike must vanish if must suppose to be in power in kind scheme for elizabeth sometimes planned marrying colonel fitzwilliam be beyond comparison pleasantest man certainly admired situation in life be most eligible to counterbalance advantage mr darcy have considerable patronage in church cousin must have none at illustration on looking up chapter xxxiii illustration more than once did elizabeth in ramble within park unexpectedly meet mr darcy felt perverseness of mischance must bring where one else be brought to prevent ever happening again took care to inform at first that be favourite haunt of hers how must occur second time therefore be very odd did even third seemed like wilful ill nature voluntary penance for on occasion be not merely few formal inquiry awkward pause then away actually thought necessary to turn back walk with never said great deal did give trouble of talking of listening much struck in course of third rencounter that be asking odd unconnected question about pleasure in being at hunsford love of solitary walk opinion of mr mr collins happiness that in speaking of rosings not perfectly understanding house seemed to expect that whenever came into kent again must be staying there too word seemed to imply must have colonel fitzwilliam in thought supposed if meant anything must mean allusion to what might arise in quarter distressed little be quite glad to find at gate in pale opposite parsonage be engaged one day a walked in re perusing janes last letter dwelling on passage proved that jane have not written in spirit when instead of being again surprised by mr darcy saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam be meeting putting away letter immediately forcing smile said did not know before ever walked way have be making tour of park replied a generally do year intended to close with call at parsonage be going much farther must have turned in moment accordingly did turn walked towards parsonage together do certainly leave kent on saturday said yes if darcy doe not put off again be at disposal arranges business just a plea if not able to please in arrangement have at least great pleasure in power of choice know anybody who seems more to enjoy power of doing what like than mr darcy like to have own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam so do be only that have better mean of having than many others because be rich many others be poor speak feelingly younger son know must be inured to self denial dependence in opinion younger son of earl can know very little of now seriously what have ever known of self denial dependence when have be prevented by want of money from going wherever chose procuring anything have fancy for be home question perhaps can not say have experienced many hardship of nature in matter of greater weight may suffer from want of money younger son can not marry where like unless where like woman of fortune think very often do habit of expense make too dependent there be not many in rank of life who can afford to marry without attention to money be thought elizabeth meant for coloured at idea recovering said in lively tone pray what be usual price of earl younger son unless elder brother be very sickly suppose must not ask above fifty thousand pound answered in same style subject dropped to interrupt silence might make fancy affected with what have passed soon afterwards said imagine cousin brought down with chiefly for sake of having somebody at disposal wonder doe not marry to secure lasting convenience of kind perhaps sister doe a well for present a be under sole care may do what like with said colonel fitzwilliam be advantage must divide with be joined with in guardianship of miss darcy be indeed pray what sort of guardian do make doe charge give much trouble young lady of age be sometimes little difficult to manage if have true darcy spirit may like to have own way a spoke observed looking at earnestly manner in immediately asked why supposed miss darcy likely to give uneasiness convinced that have somehow other got pretty near truth directly replied need not be frightened never heard harm of dare say be one of most tractable creature in world be very great favourite with lady of acquaintance mr hurst miss bingley think have heard say that know know little brother be pleasant gentlemanlike man be great friend of darcys oh yes said elizabeth drily mr darcy be uncommonly kind to mr bingley take prodigious deal of care of care of yes really believe darcy doe take care of in point where most want care from something that told in journey hither have reason to think bingley very much indebted to ought to beg pardon for have right to suppose that bingley be person meant be conjecture what be mean be circumstance darcy of course must not wish to be generally known because if be to get round to lady family must be unpleasant thing may depend upon not mentioning remember have not much reason for supposing to be bingley what told be merely that congratulated on having lately saved friend from inconvenience of most imprudent marriage without mentioning name other particular only suspected to be bingley from believing kind of young man to get into scrape of sort from knowing to have be together whole of last summer did mr darcy give reason for interference understood that there be very strong objection against lady what art did use to separate did not talk to of own art said fitzwilliam smiling only told what have now told elizabeth made answer walked on heart swelling with indignation after watching little fitzwilliam asked why be so thoughtful be thinking of what have be telling said cousin conduct doe not suit feeling why be to be judge be rather disposed to call interference officious see what right mr darcy have to decide on propriety of friend inclination why upon own judgment alone be to determine direct in what manner that friend be to be happy continued recollecting a know none of particular be not fair to condemn be not to be supposed that there be much affection in case be not unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam be lessening honour of cousin triumph very sadly be spoken jestingly appeared to so just picture of mr darcy that must not trust with answer therefore abruptly changing conversation talked on indifferent matter till reached parsonage there shut into own room a soon a visitor left must think without interruption of that have heard be not to be supposed that other people must be meant than with whom be connected there must not exist in world two men over whom mr darcy must have such boundless influence that have be concerned in measure taken to separate mr bingley jane have never doubted have always attributed to miss bingley principal design arrangement of if own vanity however did not mislead be cause pride caprice be cause of jane have suffered still continued to suffer have ruined for while hope of happiness for most affectionate generous heart in world one must say how lasting evil might have inflicted there be very strong objection against lady be colonel fitzwilliams word strong objection probably be having one uncle who be country attorney who be in business in london to jane exclaimed there must be possibility of objection loveliness goodness a be understanding excellent mind improved manner captivating must anything be urged against father who though with peculiarity have ability mr darcy need not disdain respectability will probably never reach when thought of mother indeed confidence gave way little must not allow that objection there have material weight with mr darcy whose pride be convinced must receive deeper wound from want of importance in friend connection than from want of sense be quite decided at last that have be partly governed by worst kind of pride partly by wish of retaining mr bingley for sister agitation tear subject occasioned brought on headache grew so much worse towards evening added to unwillingness to see mr darcy determined not to attend cousin to rosings where be engaged to drink tea mr collins seeing that be really unwell did not press to go a much a possible prevented husband from pressing mr collins must not conceal apprehension of lady catherine being rather displeased by staying at home illustration chapter xxxiv illustration when be gone elizabeth a if intending to exasperate a much a possible against mr darcy chose for employment examination of letter jane have written to since being in kent contained actual complaint be there revival of past occurrence communication of present suffering in in almost line of there be want of cheerfulness have be used to characterize style proceeding from serenity of mind at ease with kindly disposed towards everyone have be scarcely ever clouded elizabeth noticed sentence conveying idea of uneasiness with attention have hardly received on first perusal mr darcys shameful boast of what misery have be able to inflict gave keener sense of sister suffering be consolation to think that visit to rosings be to end on day after next still greater that in le than fortnight must be with jane again enabled to contribute to recovery of spirit by affection must do must not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering that cousin be to go with colonel fitzwilliam have made clear that have intention at agreeable a be did not mean to be unhappy about while settling point be suddenly roused by sound of door bell spirit be little fluttered by idea of being colonel fitzwilliam who have once before called late in evening might now come to inquire particularly after idea be soon banished spirit be very differently affected when to utter amazement saw mr darcy walk into room in hurried manner immediately began inquiry after health imputing visit to wish of hearing that be better answered with cold civility sat down for few moment then getting up walked about room elizabeth be surprised said not word after silence of several minute came towards in agitated manner thus began in vain have struggled will not do feeling will not be repressed must allow to tell how ardently admire love elizabeth astonishment be beyond expression stared coloured doubted be silent considered sufficient encouragement avowal of that felt have long felt for immediately followed spoke well there be feeling besides of heart to be detailed be not more eloquent on subject of tenderness than of pride sense of inferiority of being degradation of family obstacle judgment have always opposed to inclination be dwelt on with warmth seemed due to consequence be wounding be very unlikely to recommend suit in spite of deeply rooted dislike must not be insensible to compliment of such man affection though intention did not vary for instant be at first sorry for pain be to receive till roused to resentment by subsequent language lost compassion in anger tried however to compose to answer with patience when must have done concluded with representing to strength of attachment in spite of endeavour have found impossible to conquer with expressing hope that must now be rewarded by acceptance of hand a said must easily see that have doubt of favourable answer spoke of apprehension anxiety countenance expressed real security circumstance must only exasperate farther when ceased colour rose into cheek said in such case a be believe established mode to express sense of obligation for sentiment avowed however unequally may be returned be natural that obligation must be felt if must feel gratitude must now thank can not have never desired good opinion have certainly bestowed most unwillingly be sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone have be most unconsciously done however hope will be of short duration feeling tell have long prevented acknowledgment of regard can have little difficulty in overcoming after explanation mr darcy who be leaning against mantel piece with eye fixed on face seemed to catch word with le resentment than surprise complexion became pale with anger disturbance of mind be visible in feature be struggling for appearance of composure must not open lip till believed to have attained pause be to elizabeth feeling dreadful at length in voice of forced calmness said be reply be to have honour of expecting might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility be thus rejected be of small importance might a well inquire replied why with so evident design of offending insulting chose to tell that liked against will against reason even against character be not excuse for incivility if be uncivil have other provocation know have have not own feeling decided against have be indifferent have even be favourable do think that consideration must tempt to accept man who have be mean of ruining perhaps for ever happiness of most beloved sister a pronounced word mr darcy changed colour emotion be short listened without attempting to interrupt while continued have reason in world to think ill of motive can excuse unjust ungenerous part acted there dare not can not deny that have be principal if not only mean of dividing from other of exposing one to censure of world for caprice instability other to derision for disappointed hope involving in misery of acutest kind paused saw with slight indignation that be listening with air proved wholly unmoved by feeling of remorse even looked at with smile of affected incredulity can deny that have done repeated with assumed tranquillity then replied have wish of denying did everything in power to separate friend from sister rejoice in success towards have be kinder than towards elizabeth disdained appearance of noticing civil reflection meaning did not escape be likely to conciliate be not merely affair continued on dislike be founded long before have taken place opinion of be decided character be unfolded in recital received many month ago from mr wickham on subject what can have to say in what imaginary act of friendship can here defend under what misrepresentation can here impose upon others take eager interest in gentleman concern said darcy in le tranquil tone with heightened colour who know what misfortune have be can help feeling interest in misfortune repeated darcy contemptuously yes misfortune have be great indeed of infliction cried elizabeth with energy have reduced to present state of poverty comparative poverty have withheld advantage must know to have be designed for have deprived best year of life of independence be le due than desert have done yet can treat mention of misfortune with contempt ridicule cried darcy a walked with quick step across room be opinion of be estimation in hold thank for explaining so fully fault according to calculation be heavy indeed perhaps added stopping in walk turning towards offence might have be overlooked have not pride be hurt by honest confession of scruple have long prevented forming serious design bitter accusation might have be suppressed have with greater policy concealed struggle flattered into belief of being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by everything disguise of sort be abhorrence be ashamed of feeling related be natural just must expect to rejoice in inferiority of connection to congratulate on hope of relation whose condition in life be so decidedly beneath own elizabeth felt growing more angry moment yet tried to utmost to speak with composure when said be mistaken mr darcy if suppose that mode of declaration affected in other way than a spared concern might have felt in refusing have behaved in more gentlemanlike manner saw start at said nothing continued must not have made offer of hand in possible way must have tempted to accept again astonishment be obvious looked at with expression of mingled incredulity mortification went on from very beginning from first moment may almost say of acquaintance with manner impressing with fullest belief of arrogance conceit selfish disdain of feeling of others be such a to form groundwork of disapprobation on succeeding event have built so immovable dislike have not known month before felt that be last man in world whom must ever be prevailed on to marry have said quite enough madam perfectly comprehend feeling have now only to be ashamed of what own have be forgive for having taken up so much of time accept best wish for health happiness with word hastily left room elizabeth heard next moment open front door quit house tumult of mind be now painfully great knew not how to support from actual weakness sat down cried for hour astonishment a reflected on what have passed be increased by review of that must receive offer of marriage from mr darcy that must have be in love with for so many month so much in love a to wish to marry in spite of objection have made prevent friend marrying sister must appear at least with equal force in own case be almost incredible be gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong affection pride abominable pride shameless avowal of what have done with respect to jane unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though must not justify unfeeling manner have mentioned mr wickham cruelty towards whom have not attempted to deny soon overcame pity consideration of attachment have for moment excited continued in very agitating reflection till sound of lady catherine carriage made feel how unequal be to encounter charlotte observation hurried away to room illustration hearing called chapter xxxv illustration elizabeth awoke next morning to same thought meditation have at length closed eye must not yet recover from surprise of what have happened be impossible to think of anything else totally indisposed for employment resolved soon after breakfast to indulge in air exercise be proceeding directly to favourite walk when recollection of mr darcys sometimes coming there stopped instead of entering park turned up lane led farther from turnpike road park paling be still boundary on one side soon passed one of gate into ground after walking two three time along part of lane be tempted by pleasantness of morning to stop at gate look into park five week have now passed in kent have made great difference in country day be adding to verdure of early tree be on point of continuing walk when caught glimpse of gentleman within sort of grove edged park be moving way fearful of being mr darcy be directly retreating person who advanced be now near enough to see stepping forward with eagerness pronounced name have turned away on hearing called though in voice proved to be mr darcy moved again towards gate have by time reached also holding out letter instinctively took said with look of haughty composure have be walking in grove time in hope of meeting will do honour of reading that letter then with slight bow turned again into plantation be soon out of sight with expectation of pleasure with strongest curiosity elizabeth opened letter to still increasing wonder perceived envelope containing two sheet of letter paper written quite through in very close hand envelope be likewise full pursuing way along lane then began be dated from rosings at eight oclock in morning be a follows be not alarmed madam on receiving letter by apprehension of containing repetition of sentiment renewal of offer be last night so disgusting to write without intention of paining humbling by dwelling on wish for happiness of can not be too soon forgotten effort formation perusal of letter must occasion must have be spared have not character required to be written read must therefore pardon freedom with demand attention feeling know will bestow unwillingly demand of justice two offence of very different nature by mean of equal magnitude last night laid to charge first mentioned be that regardless of sentiment of have detached mr bingley from sister other have in defiance of various claim in defiance of honour humanity ruined immediate prosperity blasted prospect of mr wickham wilfully wantonly to have thrown off companion of youth acknowledged favourite of father young man who have scarcely other dependence than on patronage who have be brought up to expect exertion must be depravity to separation of two young person whose affection must be growth of only few week must bear comparison from severity of blame be last night so liberally bestowed respecting circumstance will hope to be in future secured when following account of action motif have be read if in explanation of be due to myself be under necessity of relating feeling may be offensive to yours can only say that be sorry necessity must be obeyed further apology must be absurd have not be long in hertfordshire before saw in common with others bingley preferred elder sister to other young woman in country be not till evening of dance at netherfield have apprehension of feeling serious attachment have often seen in love before at ball while have honour of dancing with be first made acquainted by sir william lucas accidental information that bingleys attention to sister have given rise to general expectation of marriage spoke of a certain event of time alone must be undecided from moment observed friend behaviour attentively must then perceive that partiality for miss bennet be beyond what have ever witnessed in sister also watched look manner be open cheerful engaging a ever without symptom of peculiar regard remained convinced from evening scrutiny that though received attention with pleasure did not invite by participation of sentiment if have not be mistaken here must have be in error superior knowledge of sister must make latter probable if be so if have be misled by such error to inflict pain on resentment have not be unreasonable will not scruple to assert that serenity of sister countenance air be such a might have given most acute observer conviction that however amiable temper heart be not likely to be easily touched that be desirous of believing indifferent be certain will venture to say that investigation decision be not usually influenced by hope fear did not believe to be indifferent because wished believed on impartial conviction a truly a wished in reason objection to marriage be not merely last night acknowledged to have required utmost force of passion to put aside in own case want of connection must not be so great evil to friend a to there be other cause of repugnance cause though still existing existing to equal degree in instance have endeavoured to forget because be not immediately before cause must be stated though briefly situation of mother family though objectionable be nothing in comparison of total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by by three younger sister occasionally even by father pardon pain to offend amidst concern for defect of nearest relation displeasure at representation of let give consolation to consider to have conducted yourselves so a to avoid share of like censure be praise le generally bestowed on eldest sister than be honourable to sense disposition of will only say farther that from what passed that evening opinion of party be confirmed inducement heightened must have led before to preserve friend from what esteemed most unhappy connection left netherfield for london on day following a be certain remember with design of soon returning part acted be now to be explained sister uneasiness have be equally excited with own coincidence of feeling be soon discovered alike sensible that time be to be lost in detaching brother shortly resolved on joining directly in london accordingly went there readily engaged in office of pointing out to friend certain evil of such choice described enforced earnestly however remonstrance might have staggered delayed determination suppose that must ultimately have prevented marriage have not be seconded by assurance hesitated not in giving of sister indifference have before believed to return affection with sincere if not with equal regard bingley have great natural modesty with stronger dependence on judgment than on own to convince therefore that have deceived be very difficult point to persuade against returning into hertfordshire when conviction have be given be scarcely work of moment can not blame for having done thus much there be one part of conduct in whole affair on reflect with satisfaction be that condescended to adopt measure of art so far a to conceal from sister being in town knew a be known to miss bingley brother be even yet ignorant of that might have met without ill consequence be perhaps probable regard did not appear to enough extinguished for to see without danger perhaps concealment disguise be beneath be done however be done for best on subject have nothing more to say other apology to offer if have wounded sister feeling be unknowingly done though motif governed may to very naturally appear insufficient have not yet learnt to condemn with respect to other more weighty accusation of having injured mr wickham can only refute by laying before whole of connection with family of what have particularly accused be ignorant of truth of what will relate can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity mr wickham be son of very respectable man who have for many year management of pemberley estate whose good conduct in discharge of trust naturally inclined father to be of service to on george wickham who be godson kindness be therefore liberally bestowed father supported at

character add even motive excellent father died about five year ago attachment to mr wickham be to last so steady that in will particularly recommended to to promote advancement in best manner that profession might allow if took order desired that valuable family living might be a soon a became vacant there be also legacy of one thousand pound own father did not long survive mine within year from event mr wickham wrote to inform that having finally resolved against taking order hoped must not think unreasonable for to expect more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of preferment by must not be benefited have intention added of studying law must be aware that interest of one thousand pound must be very insufficient support therein rather wished than believed to be sincere at rate be perfectly ready to accede to proposal knew that mr wickham ought not to be clergyman business be therefore soon settled resigned claim to assistance in church be possible that must ever be in situation to receive accepted in return three thousand pound connection between seemed now dissolved thought too ill of to invite to pemberley admit society in town in town believe chiefly lived

next day then spoke of letter repeating whole of content a far a concerned george wickham what stroke be for poor jane who must willingly have gone through world without believing that so much wickedness existed in whole race of mankind a be here collected in one individual be darcys vindication though grateful to feeling capable of consoling for such discovery most earnestly did labour to prove probability of error seek to clear one without involving other will not do said elizabeth never will be able to make of good for anything take choice must be satisfied with only one there be such quantity of merit between just enough to make one good sort of man of late have be shifting about pretty much for part be inclined to believe mr darcys will do a choose be time however before

certainly at moment in elizabeth mind more gentle sensation towards original than have ever felt in height of acquaintance commendation bestowed on by mr reynolds be of trifling nature what praise be more valuable than praise of intelligent servant a brother landlord master considered how many people be in guardianship how much of pleasure pain be in power to bestow how much of good evil must be

started for moment seemed immovable from surprise shortly recovering advanced towards party spoke to elizabeth if not in term of perfect composure at least of perfect civility have instinctively turned away stopping on approach received compliment with embarrassment impossible to be overcome have first appearance resemblance to picture have just be examining be insufficient to assure other two that now saw mr darcy gardener expression of surprise on beholding master must immediately have told stood little aloof while be talking to niece who astonished confused scarcely dared lift eye to face knew not what answer returned to civil inquiry after family amazed at alteration of manner since last parted sentence that uttered be increasing embarrassment idea of impropriety of being found there recurring to mind few minute in continued together be of most uncomfortable of life did seem much more at ease when spoke accent have none of usual sedateness repeated inquiry a to time of

did thus come day before be expected have be only ten minute sooner must have be beyond reach of discrimination for be plain that be that moment arrived that moment alighted from horse carriage blushed again again over perverseness of meeting behaviour so strikingly altered what must mean that must even speak to be amazing to speak with such civility to inquire after family never in life have seen manner so little dignified never have spoken with such gentleness a on unexpected meeting what contrast did offer to last address in rosings park when put letter into hand knew not what to think how to account for have now entered beautiful walk by side of water step be bringing forward nobler fall of ground finer reach of wood to be approaching be time before elizabeth be sensible of of though answered mechanically to repeated appeal of uncle aunt seemed to direct eye to such object a pointed out distinguished part of scene thought be fixed on one spot of pemberley house whichever might be where mr darcy then be longed to know what at moment be passing in mind in what manner thought of whether in defiance of everything be still dear to perhaps have be civil only because felt at ease yet there have be that in voice be not like ease whether have felt more of pain of pleasure in seeing must not tell certainly have not seen with composure at length however remark of companion on absence of mind roused felt necessity of appearing more like entered wood bidding adieu to river for while ascended of higher ground whence in spot where opening of tree gave eye power to wander be many charming view of valley opposite hill with long range of wood overspreading many occasionally part of stream mr gardiner expressed wish of going round whole park feared might be beyond walk with triumphant smile be told that be ten mile round settled matter pursued accustomed circuit brought again after time in descent among hanging wood to edge of water one of narrowest part crossed by simple bridge in character with general air of scene be spot le adorned than have yet visited valley here contracted into glen allowed room only for stream narrow walk amidst rough coppice wood bordered elizabeth longed to explore winding when have crossed bridge perceived distance from house mr gardiner who be not great walker must go farther thought only of returning to carriage a quickly a possible niece be therefore obliged to submit took way towards house on opposite side of river in nearest direction progress be slow for mr gardiner though seldom able to indulge taste be very fond of fishing be so much engaged in watching occasional appearance of trout in water talking to man about that advanced little whilst wandering on in slow manner be again surprised elizabeth astonishment be quite equal to what have be at first by sight of mr darcy approaching at great distance walk being here le sheltered than on other side allowed to see before met elizabeth however astonished be at least more prepared for interview than before resolved to appear to speak with calmness if really intended to meet for few moment indeed felt that must probably strike into other path idea lasted while turning in walk concealed from view turning past be immediately before with glance saw that have lost none of recent civility to imitate politeness began a met to admire beauty of place have not got beyond word delightful charming when unlucky recollection obtruded fancied that praise of pemberley from might be mischievously construed colour changed said more mr gardiner be standing little behind on pausing asked if must do honour of introducing to friend be stroke of civility for be quite unprepared must hardly suppress smile at being now seeking acquaintance of of very people against whom pride have revolted in offer to herself what will be surprise thought when know who be take now for people of fashion introduction however be immediately made a named relationship to herself stole sly look at to see how bore be not without expectation of decamping a fast a must from such disgraceful companion that be surprised by connection be evident sustained however with fortitude so far from going away turned back with entered into conversation with mr gardiner elizabeth must not be pleased must not triumph be consoling that must know have relation for whom there be need to blush listened most attentively to passed between gloried in expression sentence of uncle marked intelligence taste good manner conversation soon turned upon fishing heard mr darcy invite with greatest civility to fish there a often a chose while continued in neighbourhood offering at same time to supply with fishing tackle pointing out part of stream where there be usually most sport mr gardiner who be walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave look expressive of wonder elizabeth said nothing gratified exceedingly compliment must be for astonishment however be extreme continually be repeating why be so altered from what can proceed can not be for can not be for sake that manner be thus softened reproof at hunsford must not work such change a be impossible that must still love after walking time in way two lady in front two gentleman behind on resuming place after descending to brink of river for better inspection of curious water plant there chanced to be little alteration originated in mr gardiner who fatigued by exercise of morning found elizabeth arm inadequate to support consequently preferred husband mr darcy took place by niece walked on together after short silence lady first spoke wished to know that have be assured of absence before came to place accordingly began by observing that arrival have be very unexpected for housekeeper added informed that must certainly not be here till to morrow indeed before left bakewell understood that be not immediately expected in country acknowledged truth of said that business with steward have occasioned coming forward few hour before rest of party with whom have be travelling will join early to morrow continued among be who will claim acquaintance with mr bingley sister elizabeth answered only by slight bow thought be instantly driven back to time when mr bingleys name have be last mentioned between if might judge from complexion mind be not very differently engaged there be also one other person in party continued after pause who more particularly wish to be known to will allow do ask too much to introduce sister to acquaintance during stay at surprise of such application be great indeed be too great for to know in what manner acceded to immediately felt that desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with must be work of brother without looking farther be satisfactory be gratifying to know that resentment have not made think really ill of now walked on in silence of deep in thought elizabeth be not comfortable that be impossible be flattered pleased wish of introducing sister to be compliment of highest kind soon outstripped others when have reached carriage mr mr gardiner be quarter of mile behind then asked to walk into house declared not tired stood together on lawn at time much might have be said silence be very awkward wanted to talk there seemed embargo on subject at last recollected that have be travelling talked of matlock dovedale with great perseverance yet time aunt moved slowly patience idea be nearly worn out before tte tte be over on mr mr gardiner coming up be pressed to go into house take refreshment be declined parted on side with utmost politeness mr darcy handed lady into carriage when drove off elizabeth saw walking slowly towards house observation of uncle aunt now began of pronounced to be infinitely superior to anything have expected be perfectly well behaved polite unassuming said uncle there be something little stately in to be sure replied aunt be confined to air be not unbecoming can now say with housekeeper though people may call proud have seen nothing of be never more surprised than by behaviour to be more than civil be really attentive there be necessity for such attention acquaintance with elizabeth be very trifling to be sure lizzy said aunt be not so handsome a wickham rather have not wickhams countenance for feature be perfectly good how came to tell that be so disagreeable elizabeth excused a well a must said that have liked better when met in kent than before that have never seen so pleasant a morning perhaps may be little whimsical in civility replied uncle great men often be therefore will not take at word about fishing a might change mind day warn off ground elizabeth felt that have entirely mistaken character said nothing from what have seen of continued mr gardiner really must not have thought that must have behaved in so cruel way by anybody a have done by poor wickham have not ill natured look on contrary there be something pleasing about mouth when speaks there be something of dignity in countenance must not give one unfavourable idea of heart to be sure good lady who showed house did give most flaming character must hardly help laughing aloud sometimes be liberal master suppose that in eye of servant comprehends virtue elizabeth here felt called on to say something in vindication of behaviour to wickham therefore gave to understand in a guarded manner a must that by what have heard from relation in kent action be capable of very different construction that character be by mean so faulty wickhams so amiable a have be considered in hertfordshire in confirmation of related particular of pecuniary transaction in have be connected without actually naming authority stating to be such a might be relied on mr gardiner be surprised concerned a be now approaching scene of former pleasure idea gave way to charm of recollection be too much engaged in pointing out to husband interesting spot in environs to think of anything else fatigued a have be by morning walk have sooner dined than set off again in quest of former acquaintance evening be spent in satisfaction of intercourse renewed after many year discontinuance occurrence of day be too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for of new friend must hing think think with wonder of mr darcys civility above of wishing to be acquainted with sister illustration chapter xliv illustration elizabeth have settled that mr darcy must bring sister to visit very day after reaching pemberley be consequently resolved not to be out of sight of inn whole of morning conclusion be false for on very morning after own arrival at lambton visitor came have be walking about place with of new friend be just returned to inn to dress for dining with same family when sound of carriage drew to window saw gentleman lady in curricle driving up street elizabeth immediately recognizing livery guessed what meant imparted small degree of surprise to relation by acquainting with honour expected uncle aunt be amazement embarrassment of manner a spoke joined to circumstance many of circumstance of preceding day opened to new idea on business nothing have ever suggested before now felt that there be other way of accounting for such attention from such quarter than by supposing partiality for niece while newly born notion be passing in head perturbation of elizabeth feeling be moment increasing be quite amazed at own discomposure amongst other cause of disquiet dreaded lest partiality of brother must have said too much in favour more than commonly anxious to please naturally suspected that power of pleasing must fail retreated from window fearful of being seen a walked up down room endeavouring to compose saw such look of inquiring surprise in uncle aunt a made everything worse miss darcy brother appeared formidable introduction took place with astonishment did elizabeth see that new acquaintance be at least a much embarrassed a herself since being at lambton have heard that miss darcy

elizabeth though little more than sixteen figure be formed appearance womanly graceful be le handsome than brother there be sense good humour in face manner be perfectly unassuming gentle elizabeth who have expected to find in a acute unembarrassed observer a ever mr darcy have be be much relieved by discerning such different feeling have not be long together before darcy told that bingley be

others be talking together in tone have something of real regret that be very long time since have have pleasure of seeing before must reply added be above eight month have not met since th of november when be dancing together at netherfield elizabeth be pleased to find memory so exact afterwards took occasion to ask when unattended to by of rest whether sister be at longbourn there be not much in question in preceding remark there be look manner gave meaning be not often that must turn eye on mr darcy whenever did catch glimpse saw expression of general complaisance in that said heard

thus seeking acquaintance courting good opinion of people with whom intercourse few month ago must have be disgrace when saw thus civil not only to herself to very relation whom have openly disdained recollected last lively scene in hunsford parsonage difference change be so great struck so forcibly on mind that must hardly restrain astonishment from being visible never even in company of dear friend at netherfield dignified relation at rosings have seen so desirous to please so free from self consequence unbending reserve a now when importance must result from success of endeavour when even acquaintance of to whom attention be addressed must draw down ridicule censure of lady of netherfield rosings visitor stayed with above hour when arose to depart mr darcy called on sister to join in expressing wish of seeing mr mr gardiner miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before left country miss darcy though with diffidence marked little in habit of giving invitation readily obeyed mr gardiner looked at niece desirous of knowing how whom invitation most concerned felt disposed a to acceptance elizabeth have turned away head presuming however that studied avoidance spoke rather momentary embarrassment than dislike of proposal seeing in husband who be fond of society perfect willingness to accept ventured to engage for attendance day after next be fixed on bingley expressed great pleasure in certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still great deal to say to many inquiry to make after hertfordshire friend elizabeth construing into wish of hearing speak of sister be pleased on account a well a others found when visitor left capable of considering last half hour with satisfaction though while be passing enjoyment of have be little eager to be alone fearful of inquiry hint from uncle aunt stayed with only long enough to hear favourable opinion of bingley then hurried away to dress have reason to fear mr mr gardiner curiosity be not wish to force

now matter of anxiety to think well a far a acquaintance reached there be fault to find must not be untouched by politeness have drawn character from own feeling servant report without reference to other account circle in hertfordshire to be known must not have recognized for mr darcy there be now interest however in believing housekeeper soon became sensible that authority of servant who have known since be four year old whose own manner indicated respectability be not to be hastily rejected have anything occurred in intelligence of lambton friend must materially lessen weight have nothing to accuse of pride pride probably have if not must certainly be imputed by inhabitant of small market town where family did not visit be acknowledged however that be liberal man did much good among poor with respect to wickham traveller soon found that be not held there in much estimation for though chief of concern with son of patron be imperfectly understood be yet well known fact that on quitting derbyshire have left many debt behind mr darcy afterwards discharged a for elizabeth thought be at pemberley evening more than last evening though a passed seemed long be not long enough to

miss darcys in coming to on very day of arrival at pemberley for have reached only to late breakfast ought to be imitated though must not be equalled by exertion of politeness on side consequently that must be highly expedient to wait on at following morning be therefore to go elizabeth be pleased though when asked reason have very little to say in reply mr gardiner left soon after breakfast

there nothing must take to give present relief glass of wine will get one be very ill thank replied endeavouring to recover there be nothing matter with be quite well be only distressed by dreadful news have just received from longbourn burst into tear a alluded to for few minute must not speak word darcy in wretched suspense must only say something indistinctly of illustration have not instant to lose concern observe in compassionate silence at length spoke again have just have letter from jane with such dreadful news can not be concealed from anyone youngest sister have left friend have eloped have thrown into power of of mr wickham be gone off together from brighton know too well to doubt rest have money connection nothing can tempt to be lost for ever darcy be fixed in astonishment when consider added in yet more agitated voice might have prevented who knew what be have explained part of only part of what learnt to own family have character be known must not have happened be all too late now be grieved indeed cried darcy grieved shocked be certain absolutely certain oh yes left brighton together on sunday night be traced almost to london not beyond be certainly not gone to

have known what ought what dared to do knew not be afraid of doing too much wretched wretched mistake darcy made answer seemed scarcely to hear be walking up down room in earnest meditation brow contracted air gloomy elizabeth soon observed instantly understood power be sinking everything must sink under proof of family weakness assurance of deepest disgrace must neither wonder condemn belief of self conquest brought nothing consolatory to bosom afforded palliation of distress be on contrary exactly calculated to make understand own wish never have so honestly felt that must have loved a now when love must be vain though must intrude must not engross lydia humiliation misery be bringing on soon swallowed up private care covering face with handkerchief elizabeth be soon lost to everything else after pause of several minute be only recalled to sense of situation by voice of companion who in manner though spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said be afraid have be long desiring absence have anything to plead in excuse of stay real though unavailing concern must to heaven that anything must be said done on part might offer consolation to such distress will not torment with vain wish may seem purposely to ask for thanks unfortunate affair will fear prevent sister having pleasure of seeing at pemberley to day oh yes be so kind a to apologize for to miss darcy say that urgent business call home immediately conceal unhappy truth a long a be possible know can not be long readily assured of secrecy again expressed sorrow for distress wished happier conclusion than there be at present reason to hope leaving compliment for relation with only one serious parting look went away a quitted room elizabeth felt how improbable be that must ever see other again on such term of cordiality a have marked several meeting in derbyshire a threw retrospective glance over whole of acquaintance so full of contradiction variety sighed at perverseness of feeling must now have promoted continuance must formerly have rejoiced in termination if gratitude esteem be good foundation of affection elizabeth change of sentiment will be improbable faulty if otherwise if regard springing from such source be unreasonable unnatural in comparison of what be so often described a arising on first interview with object even before two word have be exchanged nothing can be said in defence except have given somewhat of trial to latter method in partiality for wickham that ill success might perhaps authorize to seek other le interesting mode of attachment be that a may saw go with regret in early example of what lydia infamy must produce found additional anguish a reflected on wretched business never since reading janes second letter have entertained hope of wickhams meaning to marry one jane thought must flatter with expectation surprise be least of feeling on development while content of first letter remained on mind be surprise astonishment that wickham must marry girl whom be impossible must marry for money how lydia must ever have attached have appeared incomprehensible now be too natural for such attachment a might have sufficient charm though did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in elopement without intention of marriage have difficulty in believing that virtue understanding must preserve from falling easy prey have never perceived while regiment be in hertfordshire that lydia have partiality for be convinced that lydia have wanted only encouragement to attach to anybody sometimes one officer sometimes have be favourite a attention raised in opinion affection have be continually fluctuating never without object mischief of neglect mistaken indulgence towards girl oh how acutely did now feel be wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon spot to share with jane in care must now fall wholly upon in family so deranged father absent mother incapable of exertion requiring constant attendance though almost persuaded that nothing must be done for lydia uncle interference seemed of utmost importance till entered room misery of impatience be severe mr mr gardiner have hurried back in alarm supposing by servant account that niece be taken suddenly ill satisfying instantly on head eagerly communicated cause of summons reading two letter aloud dwelling on postscript of last with trembling energy though lydia have never be favourite with mr mr gardiner must not be deeply affected not lydia only be concerned in after first exclamation of surprise horror mr gardiner readily promised assistance in power elizabeth though expecting le thanked with tear of gratitude three being actuated by one spirit everything relating to journey be speedily settled be to be off a soon a possible what be to be done about pemberley cried mr gardiner john told mr darcy be here when sent for be so yes told must not be able to keep engagement be settled what be settled repeated other a ran into room to prepare be upon such term a for to disclose real truth oh knew how be wish be vain at best must serve only to amuse in hurry confusion of following hour have elizabeth be at leisure to be idle must have remained certain that employment be impossible to one so wretched a herself have share of business a well a aunt amongst rest there be note to be written to friend at lambton with false excuse for sudden departure hour however saw whole completed mr gardiner meanwhile having settled account at inn nothing remained to be done to go elizabeth after misery of morning found in shorter space of time than must have supposed seated in carriage on road to longbourn illustration first pleasing earnest of welcome chapter xlvii illustration have be thinking over again elizabeth said uncle a drove from town really upon serious consideration be much more inclined than be to judge a eldest sister doe of matter appears to so very unlikely that young man must form design against girl who be by mean unprotected friendless who be actually staying in colonel family that be strongly inclined to hope best must expect that friend must not step forward must expect to be noticed again by regiment after such affront to colonel forster temptation be not adequate to risk do really think so cried elizabeth brightening up for moment upon word said mr gardiner begin to be of uncle opinion be really too great violation of decency honour interest for to be guilty of can not think so very ill of wickham can lizzie so wholly give up a to believe capable of not perhaps of neglecting own interest of other neglect can believe capable if indeed must be so dare not hope why must not go on to scotland if have be case in first place replied mr gardiner there be absolute proof that be not gone to scotland oh removing from chaise into hackney coach be such presumption besides trace of be to be found on barnet road well then supposing to be in london may be there though for purpose of concealment for more exceptionable purpose be not likely that money must be very abundant on side might strike that must be more economically though le expeditiously married in london than in scotland why secrecy why fear of detection why must marriage be private oh be not likely most particular friend see by janes account be persuaded of never intending to marry wickham will never marry woman without money can not afford what claim have lydia what attraction have beyond youth health good humour must make for sake forego chance of benefiting by marrying well a to what restraint apprehension of disgrace in corp might throw on dishonourable elopement with be not able to judge for know nothing of effect step might produce a to other objection be afraid will hardly hold good lydia have brother to step forward might imagine from father behaviour from indolence little attention have ever seemed to give to what be going forward in family that must do a little think a little about a father must do in matter can think that lydia be so lost to everything love of a to consent to live with on other term than marriage doe seem be most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tear in eye that sister sense of decency virtue in such point must admit of doubt really know not what to say perhaps be not doing justice be very young have never be taught to think on serious subject for last half year nay for twelvemonth have be given up to nothing amusement vanity have be allowed to dispose of time in most idle frivolous manner to adopt opinion came in way since shire be first quartered in meryton nothing love flirtation officer have be in head have be doing everything in power by thinking talking on subject to give greater what will call susceptibility to feeling be naturally lively enough know that wickham have charm of person address can captivate woman see that jane said aunt doe not think so ill of wickham a to believe capable of attempt of whom doe jane ever think ill who be there might be former conduct that must believe capable of such attempt till be proved against jane know a well a do what wickham really be know that have be profligate in sense of word that have integrity honour that be a false deceitful a be insinuating do really know cried mr gardiner whose curiosity a to mode of intelligence be alive do indeed replied elizabeth colouring told other day of infamous behaviour to mr darcy when last at longbourn heard in what manner spoke of man who have behaved with such forbearance liberality towards there be other circumstance be not at liberty be not worth while to relate lie about whole pemberley family be endless from what said of miss darcy be thoroughly prepared to see proud reserved disagreeable girl yet knew to contrary must know that be a amiable unpretending a have found doe lydia know nothing of can be ignorant of what jane seem so well to understand oh yes that be worst of till be in kent saw so much of mr darcy relation colonel fitzwilliam be ignorant of truth when returned home shire be to leave meryton in week fortnight time a be case jane to whom related whole thought necessary to make knowledge public for of what use must apparently be to anyone that good opinion neighbourhood have of must then be overthrown even when be settled that lydia must go with mr forster necessity of opening eye to character never occurred to that must be in danger from deception never entered head that consequence a must ensue may easily believe be far enough from thought when removed to brighton therefore have reason suppose to believe fond of other not slightest can remember symptom of affection on side have anything of kind be perceptible must be aware that ours be not family on must be thrown away when first entered corp be ready enough to admire so be girl in near meryton be out of sens about for first two month never distinguished by particular attention consequently after moderate period of extravagant wild admiration fancy for gave way others of regiment who treated with more distinction again became favourite may be easily believed that however little of novelty must be added to fear hope conjecture on interesting subject by repeated discussion other must detain from long during whole of journey from elizabeth thought be never absent fixed there by keenest of anguish self reproach must find interval of ease forgetfulness travelled a expeditiously a possible sleeping one night on road reached longbourn by dinnertime next day be comfort to elizabeth to consider jane must not have be wearied by long expectation little gardiner attracted by sight of chaise be standing on step of house a entered paddock when carriage drove up to door joyful surprise lighted up face displayed over whole body in variety of caper frisk be first pleasing earnest of welcome elizabeth jumped out after giving of hasty kiss hurried into vestibule where jane who came running downstairs from mother apartment immediately met elizabeth a affectionately embraced whilst tear filled eye of lost not moment in asking whether anything have be heard of fugitive not yet replied jane now that dear uncle be come hope everything will be well be father in town yes went on tuesday a wrote word have heard from often have heard only once wrote few line on wednesday to say that have arrived in safety to give direction particularly begged to do merely added that must not write again till have something of importance to mention mother how be how be mother be tolerably well trust though spirit be greatly shaken be upstairs will have great satisfaction in seeing doe not yet leave dressing room mary kitty thank heaven be quite well how be cried elizabeth look pale how much must have gone through sister however assured of being perfectly well conversation have be passing while mr mr gardiner be engaged with child be now put end to by approach of whole party jane ran to uncle aunt welcomed thanked with alternate smile tear when be in drawing room question elizabeth have already asked be of course repeated by others soon found that jane have intelligence to give sanguine hope of good however benevolence of heart suggested have not yet deserted still expected that must end well that morning must bring letter from lydia father to explain proceeding perhaps announce marriage mr bennet to whose apartment repaired after few minute conversation together received exactly a might be expected with tear lamentation of regret invective against villainous conduct of wickham complaint of own suffering ill usage blaming everybody person to whose ill judging indulgence error of daughter must be principally owing if have be able said to carry point in going to brighton with family must not have happened poor dear lydia have nobody to take care of why did forsters ever let go out of sight be sure there be great neglect other on side for be not kind of girl to do thing if have be well looked after always thought be very unfit to have charge of be over ruled a always be poor dear child now here mr bennet gone away know will fight wickham wherever meet then will be killed what be to become of collins will turn out before be cold in grave if be not kind to brother know what will do exclaimed against such terrific idea mr gardiner after general assurance of affection for family told that meant to be in london very next day must assist mr bennet in endeavour for recovering lydia give way to useless alarm added though be right to be prepared for worst there be occasion to look on a certain be not quite week since left brighton in few day more may gain news of till know that be not married have design of marrying let give matter over a lost a soon a get to town will go to brother make come home with to gracechurch street then may consult together a to what be to be done oh dear brother replied mr bennet be exactly what must most wish for now do when get to town find

to give direction about clothes till have seen for doe not know be best warehouse oh brother how kind be know will contrive mr gardiner though assured again of earnest endeavour in cause must not avoid recommending moderation to a well in hope a fear after talking with in manner till dinner be on table left to vent feeling on housekeeper who attended in absence of daughter though brother sister be persuaded that there be real occasion for seclusion from family did not attempt to oppose for knew that have not prudence enough to hold tongue before servant while waited at table judged better that one only of household one whom must most trust must comprehend fear solicitude on subject in dining room be soon joined by mary kitty who have be too busily engaged in separate apartment to make appearance before one came from book other from toilette face of however be tolerably calm change be visible in except that loss of favourite sister anger have incurred in business have given something more of fretfulness than usual to accent of kitty a for mary be mistress enough of to whisper to elizabeth with countenance of grave reflection soon after be seated at table be most unfortunate affair will probably be much talked of must stem tide of malice pour into wounded bosom of other balm of sisterly consolation then perceiving in elizabeth inclination of replying added unhappy a event must be for lydia may draw from useful lesson that loss of virtue in female be irretrievable that one false step involves in endless ruin that reputation be le brittle than be beautiful that can not be too much guarded in behaviour towards undeserving of other sex elizabeth lifted up eye in amazement be too much oppressed to make reply mary however continued to console with such kind of moral extraction from evil before in afternoon two elder miss bennet be able to be for hour by elizabeth instantly availed herself of opportunity of making inquiry jane be equally eager to satisfy after joining in general lamentation over dreadful sequel of event elizabeth considered a certain miss bennet must not assert to be wholly impossible former continued subject by saying tell everything about have not already heard give further particular what did colonel forster say have apprehension of anything before elopement took place must have seen together for ever colonel forster did own that have often suspected partiality especially on lydia side nothing to give alarm be so grieved for behaviour be attentive kind to utmost be coming to in order to assure of concern before

bear to hear thus perpetually talked of mother mean well doe not know one can know how much suffer from what say happy will be when stay at netherfield be over wish must say anything to comfort replied elizabeth be wholly out of power must feel usual satisfaction of preaching patience to sufferer be denied because have always so much mr bingley arrived mr bennet through assistance of servant contrived to have earliest tidings of that period of anxiety fretfulness on side be a long a must counted day must intervene before invitation must be sent hopeless of seeing before on third morning after arrival in hertfordshire saw from dressing room window enter paddock ride towards house daughter be eagerly called to partake of joy jane resolutely kept place at table elizabeth to satisfy mother went to window looked saw mr darcy with sat down again by sister there be gentleman with mamma said kitty who can be acquaintance other dear suppose be sure know la replied kitty look just like man used to be with before mr whats name that tall proud man good gracious mr darcy so doe vow well friend of mr bingleys will always be welcome here to be sure else must say that hate very sight of jane looked at elizabeth with surprise concern knew little of meeting in derbyshire therefore felt for awkwardness must attend sister in seeing almost for first time after receiving explanatory letter sister be uncomfortable enough felt for other of course for mother talked on of dislike of mr darcy resolution to be civil to only a mr bingleys friend without being heard by of elizabeth have source of uneasiness must not yet be suspected by jane to whom have never yet have courage to show mr gardiner letter to relate own change of sentiment towards to jane must be only man whose proposal have refused whose merit have undervalued to own more extensive information be person to whom whole family be indebted for first of benefit whom regarded with interest if not quite so tender at least a reasonable just a what jane felt for bingley astonishment at coming at coming to netherfield to longbourn voluntarily seeking again be almost equal to what have known on first witnessing altered behaviour in derbyshire colour have be driven from face returned for minute with additional glow smile of delight added lustre to eye a thought for space of time that affection wish must still be unshaken must not be secure let first see how behaves said will then be early enough for expectation sat intently at work striving to be composed without daring to lift up eye till anxious curiosity carried to face of sister a servant be approaching door jane looked little paler than usual more sedate than elizabeth have expected on gentleman appearing colour increased yet received with tolerable ease with propriety of behaviour equally free from symptom of resentment unnecessary complaisance elizabeth said a little to a civility must allow sat down again to work with eagerness did not often command have ventured only one glance at darcy looked serious a usual thought more a have be used to look in hertfordshire than a have seen at pemberley perhaps must not in mother presence be what be before uncle aunt be painful not improbable conjecture bingley have likewise seen for instant in short period saw looking pleased embarrassed be received by mr bennet with degree of civility made two daughter ashamed especially when contrasted with cold ceremonious politeness of courtesy address of friend elizabeth particularly who knew that mother owed to latter preservation of favourite daughter from irremediable infamy be hurt distressed to most painful degree by distinction so ill applied darcy after inquiring of how mr mr gardiner did question must not answer without confusion said scarcely anything be not seated by perhaps be reason of silence have not be so in derbyshire there have talked to friend when must not to herself now several minute elapsed without bringing sound of voice when occasionally unable to resist impulse of curiosity raised eye to face a often found looking at jane a at herself frequently on object ground more thoughtfulness le anxiety to please than when last met be plainly expressed be disappointed angry with for being so must expect to be otherwise said yet why did come be in humour for conversation with anyone to have hardly courage to speak inquired after sister must do more be long time mr bingley since went away said mr bennet readily agreed to began to be afraid must never come back again people did say meant to quit place entirely at

brother gardiner drawing up too wonder how came to make such awkward business of did see bingley replied that did made congratulation elizabeth dared not lift up eye how mr darcy looked therefore must not tell be delightful thing to be sure to have daughter well married continued mother at same time mr bingley be very hard to have taken away from be gone down to newcastle place quite northward seems there be to stay know how long regiment be there for suppose have heard of leaving shire of being gone into regular thank heaven have friend though perhaps not so many a deserves elizabeth who knew to be levelled at mr darcy be in such misery of shame that must hardly keep seat drew from however exertion of speaking nothing else have so effectually done before asked bingley whether meant to make stay in country at present few week believed when have killed own bird mr bingley said mother beg will come here shoot a many a please on mr bennet manor be sure will be vastly happy to oblige will save best of covey for elizabeth misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention be same fair prospect to arise at present a have flattered year ago everything be persuaded must be hastening to same vexatious conclusion at instant felt that year of happiness must not make jane amends for moment of such painful confusion first wish of heart said to be never more to be in company with of society can afford pleasure will atone for such wretchedness a let never see one other again yet misery for year of happiness be to offer compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much beauty of sister rekindled admiration of former lover when first came in have spoken to little five minute seemed to be giving more of attention found a handsome a have be last year a good natured a unaffected though not quite so chatty jane be anxious that difference must be perceived in at be really persuaded that talked a much a ever mind be so busily engaged that did not

when went to town last winter promised to take family dinner with a soon a returned have not forgot see assure be very much disappointed that did not come back keep engagement bingley looked little silly at reflection said something of concern at having be prevented by business then went away mr bennet have be strongly inclined to ask to stay dine there day though always kept very good table did not think anything le than two course must be good enough for man on whom have such anxious design satisfy appetite pride of one who have ten thousand year illustration jane happened to look round chapter liv illustration a soon a be gone elizabeth walked out to recover spirit in other word to dwell without interruption on subject must deaden more mr darcys behaviour astonished vexed why if came only to be silent grave indifferent said did come at must settle in way gave pleasure must be still amiable still pleasing to uncle aunt when be in town why not to if fear why come hither if no longer care for why silent teasing teasing man will think more about resolution be for short time involuntarily kept by approach of sister who joined with cheerful look showed better satisfied with visitor than elizabeth now said that first meeting be over feel perfectly easy know own strength will never be embarrassed again by coming be glad dines here on tuesday will then be publicly seen that on side meet only a common indifferent acquaintance yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly oh jane take care dear lizzy can not think so weak a to be in danger now think be in very

eagerly watched to see whether bingley must take place in former party have belonged to by sister prudent mother occupied by same idea forbore to invite to sit by on entering room seemed to hesitate jane happened to look round happened to smile be decided placed by elizabeth with triumphant sensation looked towards friend bore with noble indifference must have imagined that bingley have received

to advantage be not near enough to hear of discourse must see how seldom spoke to other how formal cold be manner whenever did mother ungraciousness made sense of what owed more painful to elizabeth mind must at time have given anything to be privileged to tell that kindness be unknown unfelt by whole of family be in hope that evening must afford opportunity of bringing together that whole of visit must not pas away without enabling to enter into something more of conversation than mere ceremonious salutation attending entrance anxious uneasy period passed in drawing room before gentleman came be wearisome dull to degree almost made uncivil looked forward to entrance a point on chance of pleasure for evening must depend if doe not come to then said will give up for ever gentleman came

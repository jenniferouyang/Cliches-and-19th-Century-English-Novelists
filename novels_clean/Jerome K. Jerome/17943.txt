henry a with napkin over arm leant against one of pillar of verandah sipped glass of burgundy have poured out for must believe if did tell not one of be truth for without clothes must do who must believe what asked have curious habit have henry of commenting aloud upon own unspoken thought thereby bestowing upon conversation much of quality of double acrostic have be discussing question whether sardine served purpose better a hors d'oeuvre a savoury found wondering for moment why sardine above other fish must be of unbelieving nature while endeavouring to picture to myself costume best adapted to display somewhat difficult figure of sardine henry put down glass came to rescue with necessary explanation why woman that can tell one baby from without clothes have got sister monthly nurse will tell for fact if care to ask up to three month of age there be really difference between 'em can tell girl from boy christian child from black heathen perhaps to fancy can put finger on unclothed infant say be smith be jones a case may be why be sheer nonsense take thing off shake up in blanket will bet what like be 'd never be able to tell again so long a lived agreed with

child so long a be hungry appeared to care curse for anybody when be hungry always wanted mother that other kid have got decided in end to leave to time be three year ago now possibly enough likeness to parent will develop will settle question say be up to three month old ca tell 'em care who say can paused appeared to be absorbed in contemplation of distant matterhorn then clad in rosy robe of evening there be vein of poetry in henry not uncommon among cook waiter perpetual atmosphere of hot food be inclined to think favourable to growth of softer emotion one of most sentimental men ever knew kept ham beef shop just off farringdon road in early morning must be shrewd business like when hovering with knife fork above mingled steam of bubbling sausage hissing pea pudding whimpering tramp with impossible tale of woe must impose upon easily rummiest go ever recollect in connection with baby continued henry after while gaze still fixed upon distant snow crowned peak happened to at warwick in jubilee year will never forget be proper story asked story fit for to hear on consideration henry saw harm in told to accordingly came by 'bus meet 'd handbag sort of hamper looked to like

in life led stood still after looking at sky a useful instrument regarded in appreciative spirit a work of art superlatively beautiful for moment seemed impressed with speaking loneliness of scene rather with complete abstraction from compass of sight sound of man human shape interference trouble joy be all a if be not there seemed to be on shaded hemisphere of globe sentient being save must fancy gone round to sunny side occupied thus with eye stretched afar oak gradually perceived that what have previously taken to be star low down behind outskirt of plantation be in reality such thing be artificial light almost close at hand to find utterly alone at night where company be desirable expected make people fearful case more trying by far to nerve be to discover mysterious companionship when intuition sensation memory analogy testimony probability inductionevery kind of evidence in logician listhave united to persuade consciousness that be quite alone farmer oak went towards plantation pushed through lower bough to windy side dim mass under slope reminded that shed occupied place here site being cutting into slope of hill so that at back part roof be almost level with ground in front be formed of board nailed to post covered with tar a preservative through crevice in roof side spread streak dot of light combination of made up radiance have attracted oak stepped up

felt drawing upon fancy for detail in making even horizontal clear inspection colour mould according to want within eye bring in have gabriel be able from first to get distinct view of countenance estimate of a very handsome slightly so must have be a soul required divinity at moment be ready supplied with one having for time known want of satisfactory form to fill increasing void within position moreover affording widest scope for fancy painted beauty by one of whimsical coincidence in nature like busy mother seems to spare moment from unremitting labour to turn make child smile girl now dropped cloak forth tumbled rope of black hair over red jacket oak knew instantly a heroine of yellow waggon myrtle looking glass prosily a woman who owed twopence placed calf beside mother again took up lantern went out light sinking down hill till be no more than nebula gabriel oak returned to flock chapter iii girl on horsebackconversation sluggish day began to break even position terrestrially be one of element of new interest for particular reason save that incident of night have occurred there oak went again into plantation lingering musing here heard step of horse at foot of hill soon there appeared in view auburn pony with girl on back ascending by path leading past cattle shed be young woman of night before gabriel instantly thought of hat have mentioned a having lost in wind possibly have come to look for hastily scanned ditch after walking about ten yard along found hat among leaf gabriel took in hand returned to hut here ensconced looked through loophole in direction of rider approach came up looked aroundthen on other side of hedge gabriel be about to advance restore missing article when unexpected performance induced to suspend action for present path after passing cowshed bisected plantation be not bridle pathmerely pedestrian track bough spread horizontally at height not greater than seven foot above ground made impossible to ride erect beneath girl who wore riding habit looked around for moment a if to assure that humanity be out of view then dexterously dropped backwards flat upon pony back head over tail foot against shoulder eye to sky rapidity of glide into position be that of kingfisherits noiselessness of hawk gabriel eye have scarcely be able to follow tall lank pony seemed used to such phenomenon ambled along unconcerned thus passed under level bough performer seemed quite at home anywhere between horse head tail necessity for abnormal attitude having ceased with passage of plantation began to adopt even more obviously convenient than first have side saddle be very apparent that firm seat upon smooth leather beneath be unattainable sideways springing to accustomed perpendicular like bowed sapling satisfying that nobody be in sight seated in manner demanded by saddle though hardly expected of woman trotted off in direction of tewnell mill oak be amused perhaps little astonished hanging up hat in hut went again among ewe hour passed girl returned properly seated now with bag of bran in front of on nearing cattle shed be met by boy bringing milking pail who held rein of pony whilst slid off boy led away horse leaving pail with young woman soon soft spirt alternating with loud spirt came in regular succession from within shed be sound of person milking cow gabriel took lost hat in hand waited beside path must follow in leaving hill came pail in one hand hanging against knee left arm be extended a balance enough of being shown bare to make oak wish that event have happened in summer when whole must have be revealed there be bright air manner about now by seemed to imply that desirability of existence must not be questioned rather saucy assumption failed in being offensive because beholder felt to be upon whole true like exceptional emphasis in tone of genius must have made mediocrity ridiculous be addition to recognized power be with surprise that saw gabriel face rising like moon behind hedge adjustment of farmer hazy conception of charm to portrait of now presented with be le diminution than difference starting point selected by judgment be height seemed tall pail be small one hedge diminutive hence making allowance for error by comparison with must have be not above height to be chosen by woman a best feature of consequence be severe regular may have be observed by person who go about shire with eye for beauty that in englishwoman classically formed face be seldom found to be united with figure of same pattern highly finished feature being generally too large for remainder of frame that graceful proportionate figure of eight head usually go off into random facial curve without throwing nymphean tissue over milkmaid let be said that here criticism checked in examining detail to return to where began looked at proportion with long consciousness of pleasure from contour of figure in upper part must have have beautiful neck shoulder may be stated that since infancy nobody have ever seen have be put into low dress must have run thrust head into bush yet be not shy girl by mean be merely instinct to draw line dividing seen from unseen higher than do in town that girl thought hovered about face form a soon a caught oak eye conning same page be natural almost certain self consciousness shown must have be vanity if little more pronounced dignity if little le ray of male vision seem to have tickling effect upon virgin face in rural district hastily brushed hers with hand a if gabriel have be irritating pink surface with straw free air of previous movement be reduced at same time to chastened phase of yet be man who blushed maid not at found hat said oak be mine said from sense of proportion kept down to small smile inclination to laugh distinctly flew

heregoing through plantation down hill said farmer oak with aspect excessively knowing with regard to matter in mind a gazed at remote point in direction named then turned back to meet colloquists eye perception caused to withdraw own from hers a suddenly a if have be caught in theft recollection of strange antic have indulged in when passing through tree be succeeded in girl by nettled palpitation that by hot face be time to see woman redden who be not given to reddening a rule not point in milkmaid be of deepest rose colour from maiden blush through variety of provence down to crimson tuscany countenance of oak acquaintance quickly graduated whereupon in considerateness turned away head sympathetic man still looked other way wondered when must recover whiteness sufficient to justify in facing again heard what seemed to be flitting of dead leaf upon breeze looked have gone away with air between of tragedy comedy gabriel returned to work five morning evening passed young woman came regularly to milk healthy cow to attend to sick one never allowed vision to stray in direction of oak person want of tact have deeply offended hernot by seeing what must not help by letting know that have seen for a without law there be sin without eye there be indecorum appeared to feel that gabriel espial have made indecorous woman without own connivance be food for great regret with be also contretemps touched into life latent heat have experienced in direction acquaintanceship might however have ended in slow forgetting for incident occurred at end of same week one afternoon began to freeze frost increased with evening drew on like stealthy tightening of bond be time when in cottage breath of sleeper freeze to sheet when round drawing room fire of thick walled mansion sitter back be cold even whilst face be aglow many small bird went to bed supperless night among bare bough a milking hour drew near oak kept usual watch upon cowshed at last felt cold shaking extra quantity of bedding round yeaning ewe entered hut heaped more fuel upon stove wind came in at bottom of door to prevent oak wheeled cot round little more to south then wind spouted in at ventilating holeof there be one on side of hut gabriel have always known that when fire be lighted door closed one of must be kept openthat chosen being always on side away from wind closing slide to windward turned to open other on second thought farmer considered that must first sit down leaving closed for minute two till temperature of hut be little raised sat down head began to ache in unwonted manner fancying weary by reason of broken rest of preceding night oak decided to get up open slide then allow to fall asleep fell asleep without having performed necessary preliminary how long remained unconscious gabriel

than thisastonishingly morehis head be upon lap face neck be disagreeably wet finger be unbuttoning collar be matter said oak vacantly seemed to experience sensation of mirth of too insignificant kind to start capacity of enjoyment nothing now answered since be not dead be wonder be not suffocated in hut of yours ah hut murmured gabriel gave ten pound for hut ill sell sit under thatched hurdle a did in old time curl up to sleep in lock of straw played nearly same trick other day gabriel by way of emphasis brought down fist upon floor be not exactly fault of hut observed speaking in tone showed to be that novelty among womenone who finished thought before beginning sentence be to convey must think have considered not have be so foolish a to leave slide closed yes suppose must said oak absently be endeavouring to catch appreciate sensation of being thus with herhis head upon dressbefore event passed on into heap of bygone thing wished knew impression must a soon have thought of carrying odour in net a of attempting to convey intangibility of feeling in coarse mesh of language so remained silent made sit up then oak began wiping face shaking like samson how can thank ye said at last gratefully of natural rusty red having returned to face oh never mind said girl smiling allowing smile to hold good for gabriel next remark whatever might prove to be how did find heard dog howling scratching at door of hut when came to milking be so lucky daisy milking be almost over for season will not come here after week next dog saw jumped over to laid hold of dress came across looked round hut very first thing to see if slide be closed uncle have hut like one have heard tell shepherd not to go to sleep without leaving slide open opened door there be like dead threw milk over a there be water forgetting be warm use wonder if must have died gabriel said in low voice be rather meant to travel back to than to oh girl replied seemed to prefer le tragic probability to have

earnest conclusion to dialogue lightly carried on very well said gave hand compressing lip to demure impassivity held instant in fear of being too demonstrative swerved to opposite extreme touching finger with lightness of small hearted person be sorry said instant after regretfully what for letting hand go so quickly may have again if like there be gave hand again oak held longer timeindeed curiously long how soft isbeing winter time toonot chapped rough anything said therethats long enough said though without pulling away suppose be thinking must like to kiss may if want to wasnt

upon arm seemed so impressed that instead of cropping herbage looked up think hope care enough for to listen to what have to tell bathsheba momentary impulse at hearing be to ask why thought that till

power posse of believing cajolery that know to be falseexcept indeed in of being utterly sceptical on stricture that know to be true bathsheba loved troy in way that only self reliant woman love when abandon self reliance when strong woman recklessly throw away strength be worse than weak woman who have never have strength to throw away one source of inadequacy be novelty of occasion have never

with homely oak whose defect be patent to blindest whose virtue be a metal in mine difference between love respect be markedly shown in conduct bathsheba have spoken of interest in boldwood with greatest freedom to liddy have only communed with own heart concerning troy infatuation gabriel saw be troubled thereby from time of daily journey field to time of return on to small hour of many night that be not beloved have hitherto be great sorrow that bathsheba be getting into toil be now sorrow greater than first one nearly obscured be result paralleled oft quoted observation of hippocrates concerning physical pain be noble though perhaps unpromising love not even fear of breeding aversion in bosom of one beloved can deter from combating error oak determined to speak to mistress must base appeal on what considered unfair treatment of farmer boldwood now absent from home opportunity occurred one evening when have gone for short walk by path through neighbouring corn field be dusk when oak who have not be far field day took same path met returning quite pensively a thought wheat be now tall path be narrow thus way be quite sunken groove between embrowing thicket

following at heel when have brushed somewhat quickly by thank indeed be not very fearful oh there be bad character about never meet now oak with marvellous ingenuity have be going to introduce gallant sergeant through channel of bad character at once scheme broke down suddenly occurring to that be rather clumsy way too barefaced to begin with tried preamble a man who must naturally come to meet be away from home tooi mean farmer boldwoodwhy think ill go said ah yes walked on without turning head for many step nothing further be heard from quarter than rustle of dress against heavy corn ear then resumed rather tartly dont quite understand what meant by saying that mr boldwood must naturally come to meet meant on account of wedding say be likely to take place between miss forgive speaking

other day said be trifling with almost proved that be not lately have said that be not straightway begin to show that be suppose mean well hope speak truth do wrongly applied dont trifle with then have nothing to do with oak be unfortunately led on to speak of boldwoods rival in wrong tone to after wish have never met that young sergeant troy miss sighed bathsheba step became faintly spasmodic why asked be not good enough for did one tell to speak to like nobody at then appears to that sergeant troy doe not concern here said intractably yet must say that sergeant troy be educated man quite worthy of woman be well born being higher in learning birth than ruck of soldier be anything proof of worth show course to be downward can not see what have to do with conversation mr troy course be not by mean downward superiority be proof of worth believe to have conscience at can not help begging miss to have nothing to do with listen to onceonly once dont say he such bad man a have fanciedi pray to god be not since dont exactly know what be why not behave a if might be bad simply for own safety dont trust mistress ask not to trust so why pray like soldier one like said sturdily nature of

that at rate must wish to do harm beyond put aside have lost in race for money good thing be not such fool a to pretend to now be poor have got altogether above bathsheba dear mistress beg to considerthat to keep well honoured among workfolk in common generosity to honourable man who love a well a must be more discreet in bearing towards soldier dont dont dont exclaimed in choking voice be not more to than own affair even life went on come listen to be six year older than mr boldwood be ten year older than consideri do beg of to consider before be too latehow safe must be in hand oak allusion to own love for lessened to extent anger at interference must not really forgive for letting wish to marry be eclipsed by wish to do good more than for slighting treatment of troy wish to go elsewhere said paleness of face invisible to eye being suggested by trembling word remain on farm longer dont want youi beg to go thats nonsense said oak calmly be second time have pretended to dismiss whats use of pretended will go siryour lecturing will not hear be mistress here go indeedwhat folly will say next treating like dick tom harry when know that short time ago position be a good

walking about hill down of weatherbury like unhappy shade in mournful field by acheron chapter v at upper window be very early next morninga time of sun dew confused beginning of many bird song spread into healthy air wan blue of heaven be here there coated with thin web of incorporeal cloud be of effect in obscuring day light in scene be yellow a to colour shadow be attenuated a to form creeping plant about old manor house be bowed with row of heavy water drop have upon object behind effect of minute lens of high magnifying power just before clock struck five gabriel oak coggan passed village cross went on together to field be yet barely in view of mistress house when oak fancied saw opening of casement in one of upper window two men be at moment partially screened by elder bush now beginning to be enriched with black bunch of fruit paused before emerging from shade handsome man leaned idly from lattice looked east then west in manner of one who make first morning survey man be sergeant troy red jacket be loosely thrown on not buttoned have altogether relaxed bearing of soldier taking ease coggan spoke first looking quietly at window have married said gabriel have previously

above oak how white face be look like corpse do said oak with faint smile lean on gate ill wait bit right right stood by gate awhile gabriel listlessly staring at ground mind sped into future saw there enacted in year of leisure scene of repentance must ensue from work of haste that be married have instantly decided why have be so mysteriously managed be not at bathsheba way of doing thing with fault be candour must have be entrapped union be not only unutterable grief to amazed notwithstanding that have passed preceding week in suspicion that such might be issue of troy meeting away from home quiet return with liddy have to extent dispersed dread just a imperceptible motion appears like stillness be infinitely divided in property from stillness so have struggling hope against imagined deed differentiated entirely from thing actually done in few minute moved on again towards house sergeant still looked from window morning comrade shouted in cheery voice when came up coggan replied to greeting baint ye going to answer man then said to gabriel id say good morningyou neednt spend hapeth of meaning upon yet keep man civil gabriel soon decided too that since deed be done to put best face upon matter must be greatest kindness to loved good morning sergeant troy returned in ghastly voice rambling gloomy house said troy smiling whythey may not be married suggested coggan perhaps shes not there gabriel shook head soldier turned little towards east sun kindled scarlet coat to orange glow be nice old house responded gabriel yesi suppose so feel like new wine in old bottle here notion be that sash window must be put throughout old wainscoted wall brightened up bit oak cleared quite away wall papered must be pity think well no philosopher once said in hearing that old builder who worked when art be living thing have respect for work of builder who went before pulled down altered a thought fit why shouldnt creation preservation dont do well together say million of antiquarian cant invent style mind exactly be for making place more modern that may be cheerful whilst can military man turned surveyed interior of room to assist idea of improvement in direction gabriel coggan began to move on oh coggan said troy a if inspired by recollection do know if insanity have ever appeared in mr boldwoods family jan reflected for moment once heard that uncle of be queer in head dont know right ot said be of importance said troy lightly well will be down in field with time week have few matter to attend to first so good day to will of course keep on just a friendly term a usual im not proud man nobody be ever able to say that of sergeant troy however what be must be here crown to drink health men troy threw coin dexterously across front plot towards gabriel who shunned in fall face turning to angry red coggan twirled eye edged forward caught money in ricochet upon grass very wellyou keep coggan said gabriel with disdain almost fiercely a for ill do without gift from dont show too much said coggan musingly for if he married to mark word hell buy discharge be master here therefore ti well to say friend outwardly though say troublehouse within wellperhaps be best to be silent cant go further than cant flatter if place here be only to be kept by smoothing down place must be lost horseman whom have for time seen in distance now appeared close beside there mr boldwood said oak wonder what troy meant by question coggan oak nodded respectfully to farmer just checked pace to discover if be wanted finding be not stood back to let pas on only sign of terrible sorrow boldwood have be combating through night be combating now be want of colour in well defined face enlarged appearance of vein in forehead temple sharper line about mouth horse bore away very step of animal seemed significant of dogged despair gabriel for minute rose above own grief in noticing boldwoods saw square figure sitting erect upon horse head turned to side elbow steady by hip brim of hat level undisturbed in onward glide until keen edge of boldwoods shape sank by degree over hill to one who knew man story there be something more striking in immobility than in collapse clash of discord between mood matter here be forced painfully home to heart a in laughter there be more dreadful phase than in tear so be there in steadiness of agonized man expression deeper than cry chapter vi wealth in jeopardythe revel one night at end of august when bathsheba experience a married woman be still new when weather be yet dry sultry man stood motionless in stackyard of weatherbury upper farm looking at moon sky night have sinister aspect heated breeze from south slowly fanned summit of lofty object in sky dash of buoyant cloud be sailing in course at right angle to

evening sheep have trailed homeward head to head behaviour of rook have be confused horse have moved with timidity caution thunder be imminent taking secondary appearance into consideration be likely to be followed by one of lengthened rain mark close of dry weather for season before twelve hour have passed harvest atmosphere must be bygone thing oak gazed with misgiving at eight naked unprotected rick massive heavy with rich produce of one half farm for year went on to barn be night have be selected by sergeant troyruling now in room of wifefor giving harvest supper dance a oak approached building sound of violin tambourine regular jigging of many foot grew more distinct came close to large door one of stood slightly ajar looked in central space together with recess at one end be

streaming down cheek tambourine quivering in hand dance ended on black oak floor in midst new row of couple formed for now maam offence hope ask what dance must like next said first violin really make difference said clear voice of bathsheba who stood at inner end of building observing scene from behind table covered with cup viand troy be lolling beside then said fiddler ill venture to name that right proper thing be soldier joythere being gallant soldier married into farmhey sonny gentleman will be soldier joy exclaimed chorus thanks for compliment said sergeant gaily taking bathsheba by hand leading to top of dance for though have purchased discharge from most gracious majesty regiment of cavalry th dragoon guard to attend to new duty awaiting here will continue soldier in spirit feeling a long a live so dance began a to merit of soldier joy there can not be never be two opinion have be observed in musical circle of weatherbury vicinity that melody at end of three quarter of hour of thunderous footing still posse more stimulative property for heel toe than majority of other dance at first opening soldier joy have too additional charm in being so admirably adapted to tambourine aforesaidno mean instrument in hand of performer who understands proper convulsion spasm st vitus dance fearful frenzy necessary when exhibiting tone in highest perfection immortal tune ended fine dd rolling forth from bass viol with sonorousness of cannonade gabriel delayed entry no longer avoided bathsheba got a near a possible to platform where sergeant troy be now seated drinking brandy water though others drank without exception cider ale gabriel must not easily thrust within speaking distance of sergeant sent message asking to come down for moment sergeant said must not attend will tell then said gabriel that only stepped athart to say that heavy rain be sure to fall soon that something must be done to protect rick mr troy say will not rain returned messenger can not stop to talk to about such fidget in juxtaposition with troy oak have melancholy tendency to look like candle beside gas ill at ease went out again thinking must go home for under circumstance have heart for scene in barn at door paused for moment troy be speaking friend be not only harvest home that be celebrating to night be also wedding feast short time ago have happiness to lead to altar lady mistress not until now have be able to give public flourish to event in weatherbury that may be thoroughly well done that man may go happy to bed have ordered to be brought here bottle of brandy kettle of hot water treble strong goblet will handed round to guest bathsheba put hand upon arm with upturned pale face said imploringly nodont give to thempray dont frank will only do harm have have enough of everything trewwe dont wish for more thank ye said one two pooh said sergeant contemptuously raised voice a if lighted up by new idea friend said well send woman folk home ti time be in bed then cockbirds will have jolly carouse to ourselves if of men show white feather let look elsewhere for winter work bathsheba indignantly left barn followed by woman child musician not looking upon a company slipped quietly away to spring waggon put in horse thus troy men on farm be left sole occupant of place oak not to appear unnecessarily disagreeable stayed little while then too arose quietly took departure followed by friendly oath from sergeant for not staying to second round of grog gabriel proceeded towards home in approaching door toe kicked something felt sounded soft leathery distended like boxing glove be large toad humbly travelling across path oak took up thinking might be better to kill creature to save from pain finding uninjured placed again among grass knew what direct message from great mother meant soon came when struck light indoors there appeared upon table thin glistening streak a if brush of varnish have be lightly dragged across oak eye followed serpentine sheen to other side where led up to huge brown garden slug have come indoors to night for reason of own be nature second way of hinting to that be to prepare for foul weather oak sat down meditating for nearly hour during time two black spider of kind common in thatched house promenaded ceiling ultimately dropping to floor reminded that if there be one class of manifestation on matter that thoroughly understood be instinct of sheep left room ran across two three field towards flock got upon hedge looked over among be crowded close together on other side around furze bush first peculiarity observable be that on sudden appearance of oak head over fence did not stir run away have now terror of something greater than terror of man be not most noteworthy feature be grouped in such way that tail without single exception be towards that half of horizon from storm threatened there be inner circle closely huddled outside radiated wider apart pattern formed by flock a whole being not unlike vandyked lace collar to clump of furze bush stood in position of wearer neck be enough to re establish in original opinion knew now that be right troy be wrong voice in nature be unanimous in bespeaking change two distinct translation attached to dumb expression apparently there be to be thunder storm afterwards cold continuous rain creeping thing seemed to know about later rain hut little of interpolated thunder storm whilst sheep knew about thunder storm nothing of latter rain complication of weather being uncommon be more to be feared oak returned to stack yard be silent here conical tip of rick jutted darkly into sky there be five wheat rick in yard three stack of barley wheat when threshed must average about thirty quarter to stack barley at least forty value to bathsheba indeed to anybody oak mentally estimated by following simple calculation quarter quarter total seven hundred fifty pound in divinest form that money can wearthat of necessary food for man beast must risk be run of deteriorating bulk of corn to le than value because of instability of woman never if can prevent said gabriel such be argument that oak set outwardly before man even to be cryptographic page having ostensible writing between line be possible that there be golden legend under utilitarian one will help to last effort woman have loved so dearly went back to barn to endeavour to obtain assistance for covering rick very night be silent within must have passed on in belief that party have broken up have not dim light a saffron by contrast with greenish whiteness outside streamed through knot hole in folding door gabriel looked in offensive picture met eye candle suspended among evergreen have burnt down to socket in case leaf tied about be scorched many of light have quite gone out others smoked stank grease dropping from upon floor here under table leaning against form chair in conceivable attitude except perpendicular be wretched person of work folk hair of head at such low level being suggestive of mop broom in midst of shone red distinct figure of sergeant troy leaning back in chair coggan be on back with mouth open buzzing forth snore a be several others united breathing of horizonal assemblage forming subdued roar like london from distance joseph poorgrass be curled round in fashion of hedgehog apparently in attempt to present least possible portion of surface to air behind be dimly visible unimportant remnant of william smallbury glass cup still stood upon table water jug being overturned from small rill after tracing course with marvellous precision down centre of long table fell into neck of unconscious mark clark in steady monotonous drip like dripping of stalactite in cave gabriel glanced hopelessly at group with one two exception composed able bodied men upon farm saw at once that if rick be to be saved night even next morning must save with own hand faint ting ting resounded from under coggans waistcoat be coggans watch striking hour of two went to recumbent form of matthew moon who usually undertook rough thatching of homestead shook shaking be without effect gabriel shouted in ear wheres thatching beetle rick stick spar under staddle said moon mechanically with unconscious promptness of medium gabriel let go head dropped upon floor like bowl then went to susan tall husband wheres key of granary answer question be repeated with same result to be shouted to at night be evidently le of novelty to susan tall husband than to matthew moon oak flung down tall head into corner again turned away to be just men be not greatly to blame for painful demoralizing termination to evening entertainment sergeant troy have so strenuously insisted glass in hand that drinking must be bond of union that who wished to refuse hardly liked to be so unmannerly under circumstance having from youth up be entirely unaccustomed to liquor stronger than cider mild ale be wonder that have succumbed one with extraordinary uniformity after lapse of about hour gabriel be greatly depressed debauch boded ill for wilful fascinating mistress whom faithful man even now felt within a embodiment of be sweet bright hopeless put out expiring light that barn might not be endangered closed door upon men in deep oblivious sleep went again into lone night hot breeze a if breathed from parted lip of dragon about to swallow globe fanned from south while directly opposite in north rose grim misshapen body of cloud in very teeth of wind so unnaturally did rise one must fancy to be lifted by machinery from below meanwhile faint cloudlets have flown back into south east corner of sky a if in terror of large cloud like young brood gazed in upon by monster going on to village oak flung small stone against window of laban tall bedroom expecting susan to open nobody stirred went round to back door have be left unfastened for laban entry passed in to foot of staircase mr tall ive come for key of granary to get at rick cloth said oak in stentorian voice be that said mr susan tall half awake yes said gabriel come along to bed do draw latching roguekeeping body awake like isnt labantis gabriel oak want key of granary gabriel what in name of fortune did pretend to be laban for didnt thought meant yes did what do want here key of granary take then ti on nail people coming disturbing woman at time of night ought gabriel took key without waiting to hear conclusion of tirade ten minute later lonely figure might have be seen dragging four large waterproof covering across yard soon two of heap of treasure in grain be covered snugtwo cloth to two hundred pound be secured three wheat stack remained open there be more cloth oak looked under staddle found fork mounted third pile of wealth began operating adopting plan of sloping upper sheaf one over other in addition filling interstice with material of untied sheaf so far be well by hurried contrivance bathsheba property in wheat be safe for at rate week two provided always that there be not much wind next came barley be only possible to protect by systematic thatching time went on moon vanished not to re appear be farewell of ambassador previous to war night have haggard look like sick thing there came finally utter expiration of air from whole heaven in form of slow breeze might have be likened to death now nothing be heard in yard dull thud of beetle drove in spar rustle of thatch in interval chapter vii stormthe two together light flapped over scene a if reflected from phosphorescent wing crossing sky rumble filled air be first arrow from approaching storm fell wide second peal be noisy with comparatively little visible lightning gabriel saw candle shining in bathsheba bedroom soon shadow moved to fro upon blind then there came third flash manuvres of most extraordinary kind be going on in vast firmamental hollow overhead lightning now be colour of silver gleamed in heaven like mailed army rumble became rattle gabriel from elevated position must see over landscape at least dozen mile in front hedge bush tree be distinct a in line engraving in paddock in same direction be herd of heifer form of be visible at moment in act of galloping about in wildest maddest confusion flinging heel tail high into air head to earth poplar in immediate foreground be like ink stroke on burnished tin then picture vanished leaving darkness so intense that gabriel worked entirely by feeling with hand have stuck ricking rod poignard a be indifferently calleda long iron lance sharp at extremity polished by handlinginto stack to support sheaf blue light appeared in zenith in indescribable manner flickered down near top of rod be fourth of larger flash moment later there be smacksmart clear short gabriel felt position to be anything safe one resolved to descend not drop of rain have fallen a yet wiped weary brow looked again at black form of unprotected stack be life so valuable to after what be prospect that must be so chary of running risk when important urgent labour must not be carried on without such risk resolved to stick to stack however took precaution under staddle be long tethering chain used to prevent escape of errant horse carried up ladder sticking rod through clog at one end allowed other end of chain to trail upon ground spike attached to drove in under shadow of extemporized lightning conductor felt comparatively safe before oak have laid hand upon tool again out leapt fifth flash with spring of serpent shout of fiend be green a emerald reverberation be stunning what be light revealed to in open ground before a looked over ridge of rick be dark apparently female form must be that of only venturesome woman in parishbathsheba form moved on step then must see more be that maam said gabriel to darkness who be there said voice of bathsheba gabriel be on rick thatching oh gabrieland be have come about weather awoke thought of corn be so distressed about itcan save anyhow

head from large patch of turf have eaten bare readjusted bough over coffin drove along through unwholesome night have gradually become rumoured in village that body to be brought buried that day be be left of unfortunate fanny robin who have followed eleventh from casterbridge to melchester thanks to boldwoods reticence oak generosity lover have followed have never be individualized a troy gabriel hoped that whole truth of matter might not be published till at rate girl have be in grave for few day when interposing barrier of earth time sense that event have be somewhat shut into oblivion must deaden sting that revelation invidious remark must have for bathsheba just now by time gabriel reached old manor house residence lay in way to church be quite dark man came from gate said through fog hung between like blown flour be that poorgrass with corpse gabriel recognized voice a of parson corpse be here sir said gabriel have just be to inquire of mr troy if must tell reason of delay be afraid be too late now for funeral to be performed with proper decency have registrar certificate said gabriel expect poorgrass have he at buck head forgot to ask for then that settle matter well put off funeral till to morrow morning body may be brought on to church may be left here at farm fetched by bearer in morning waited more than hour have now gone home gabriel have reason for thinking latter most objectionable plan notwithstanding that fanny have be inmate of farm house for several year in lifetime of bathsheba uncle vision of several unhappy contingency might arise from delay flitted before will be not law went indoors to inquire of mistress what be wish on subject found in unusual mood eye a looked up to be suspicious perplexed a with antecedent thought troy have not yet returned at first bathsheba assented with mien of indifference to proposition that must go on to church at once with burden immediately afterwards following gabriel to gate swerved to extreme of solicitousness on fanny account desired that girl might be brought into house oak argued upon convenience of leaving in waggon just a lay now with flower green leaf about merely wheeling vehicle into coach house till morning to purpose be unkind unchristian said to leave poor thing in coach house night very well then said parson will arrange that funeral will take place early to morrow perhaps mr troy be right in feeling that can not treat dead fellow creature too thoughtfully must remember that though may have erred grievously in leaving home be still sister be to be believed that god uncovenanted mercy be extended towards that be member of flock of christ parson word spread into heavy air with sad yet unperturbed cadence gabriel shed honest tear bathsheba seemed unmoved mr thirdly then left gabriel lighted lantern fetching three other men to assist bore unconscious truant indoors placing coffin on two bench in middle of little sitting room next hall a bathsheba directed one except gabriel oak then left room still indecisively lingered beside body be deeply troubled at wretchedly ironical aspect circumstance be putting on with regard to troy wife at own powerlessness to counteract in spite of careful manuvring day very worst event must in way have happened in connection with burial have happened now oak imagined terrible discovery resulting from afternoon work might cast over bathsheba life shade interposition of many lapsing year might indifferently lighten nothing at might altogether remove suddenly a in last attempt to save bathsheba from at rate immediate anguish looked again a have looked before at chalk writing upon coffin lid scrawl be simple one fanny robin child gabriel took handkerchief carefully rubbed out two latter word then left room went out quietly by front door chapter xiii fanny revenge do want longer maam inquired liddy at later hour same evening standing by door with chamber candlestick in hand addressing bathsheba who sat cheerless alone in large parlour beside first fire of season no more to night liddy ill sit up for master if like maam be not at afraid of fanny if may sit in own room have candle be such childlike nesh young thing that spirit couldnt appear to anybody if tried im quite sure oh go to bed ill sit up for till twelve oclock if have not arrived by time will give up go to bed too be half past ten now oh be why dont sit upstairs maam why dont said bathsheba desultorily isnt worth whiletheres fire here liddy suddenly exclaimed in impulsive excited whisper have heard anything strange said of fanny word have sooner escaped than expression of unutterable regret crossed face burst into tear nonot word said liddy looking at weeping woman with astonishment what be make cry so maam have anything hurt came to bathsheba side with face full of sympathy liddyi dont want more can hardly say why have taken so to cry lately never used to cry good night liddy then left parlour closed door bathsheba be lonely miserable now not lonelier actually than have be before marriage loneliness then be to of present time a solitude of mountain be to solitude of cave within last day two have come disquieting thought about husband past wayward sentiment that evening concerning fanny temporary resting place have be result of strange complication of impulse in bathsheba bosom perhaps must be more accurately described a determined rebellion against prejudice revulsion from lower instinct of uncharitableness must have withheld sympathy from dead woman because in life have preceded bathsheba in attention of man whom bathsheba have by mean ceased from loving though love be sick to death just now with gravity of further misgiving in five ten minute there be tap at door liddy reappeared coming in little way stood hesitating until at length said maryann have just heard something very strange know isnt true will be sure to know right of in day two what be oh nothing connected with maam be about fanny same thing have heard have heard nothing mean that wicked story be got to weatherbury within last hourthat liddy came close to mistress whispered remainder of sentence slowly into ear inclining head a spoke in direction of room where fanny lay bathsheba trembled from head to foot dont believe said excitedly be not written on coffin cover maam good many others dont for must surely have be told more about if have be truedont think so maam might might not bathsheba turned looked into fire liddy might not see face finding that mistress be going to say more liddy glided out closed door softly went to bed bathsheba face a continued looking into fire that evening might have excited solicitousness on account even among who loved least sadness of fanny robin fate did not make bathsheba glorious although be esther to poor vashti fate might be supposed to stand in respect a contrast to other when liddy came into room second time beautiful eye met hers have worn listless weary look when went out after telling story have expressed wretchedness in full activity also sank to apathy after time thought sluggish confused at first acquired more life a minute passed dull misgiving in brow eye suddenly gave way to stillness of concentration bathsheba have ground for conjecturing connection between own history dimly suspected tragedy of fanny end oak boldwood never for moment credited with possessing meeting with lonely woman on previous saturday night have be unwitnessed unspoken of oak may have have best of intention in withholding for a many day a possible detail of what have happened have known that bathsheba perception have already be exercised in matter must have done nothing to lengthen minute of suspense be now undergoing when certainty must terminate must be worst fact suspected after suddenly felt longing desire to speak to one stronger than so get strength to sustain surmised position with dignity carking doubt with stoicism where must find such friend nowhere in house be by far coolest of woman under roof patience suspension of judgement for few hour be what wanted to learn there be nobody to teach might go to gabriel oakbut must not be what way oak have thought of enduring thing boldwood who seemed so much deeper higher stronger in feeling than gabriel have not yet learnt more than herself simple lesson oak showed mastery of by turn look gavethat among multitude of interest by be surrounded affected personal well being be not most absorbing important in eye oak meditatively looked upon horizon of circumstance without special regard to own standpoint in midst be how must wish to be then oak be not racked by incertitude upon inmost matter of bosom a be at moment oak knew that wished to knowshe felt convinced of if be to go to now at once say no more than few word what be truth of story must feel bound in honour to tell must be inexpressible relief further speech must need to be uttered knew so well that eccentricity of behaviour in must alarm flung cloak round went to door opened blade twig be still air be yet thick with moisture though somewhat le dense than during afternoon steady smack of drop upon fallen leaf under bough be almost musical in soothing regularity seemed better to be out of house than within bathsheba closed door walked slowly down lane till came opposite to gabriel cottage where now lived alone having left coggans house through being pinched for room there be light in one window only be downstairs shutter be not closed be blind curtain drawn over window robbery observation being contingency must do much injury to occupant of domicile yes be gabriel who be sitting up be reading from standing place in road must see plainly sitting quite still light curly head upon hand only occasionally looking up to snuff candle stood beside at length looked at clock seemed surprised at lateness of hour closed book arose be going to bed knew if tapped must be done at once ala for resolve felt must not do not for world now must give hint about misery to much le ask plainly for information must suspect guess chafe bear alone like homeless wanderer lingered by bank a if lulled fascinated by atmosphere of content seemed to spread from little dwelling be so sadly lacking in own gabriel appeared in upper room placed light in window bench thenknelt down to pray contrast of picture with rebellious agitated existence at same time be too much for to bear to look upon longer be not for to make truce with trouble by such mean must tread giddy distracting measure to last note a have begun with swollen heart went again up lane entered own door more fevered now by reaction from first feeling oak example have raised in paused in hall looking at door of room wherein fanny lay locked finger threw back head strained hot hand rigidly across forehead saying with hysterical sob must to god must speak tell secret fanny oh hope hope be not true if must only look in upon for one little minute must know few moment passed added slowly will bathsheba in after time must never gauge mood carried through action following murmured resolution on memorable evening of life at end of short though undefined time found in small room quivering with emotion mist before eye excruciating pulsation in brain standing beside uncovered coffin of girl whose conjectured end have so entirely engrossed saying to herself in husky voice a gazed within be best to know worst know now be conscious of having brought about situation by series of action done a by one in extravagant dream of following idea a to method have burst upon in hall with glaring obviousness by gliding to top of stair assuring by listening to heavy breathing of maid that be asleep gliding down again turning handle of door within young girl lay deliberately setting to do what if have anticipated such undertaking at night alone must have horrified when done be not so dreadful a be conclusive proof came with knowing beyond doubt last chapter of fanny story bathsheba head sank upon bosom breath have be bated in suspense curiosity interest be exhaled now in form of whispered wail oh h h said silent room added length to moan tear fell fast beside unconscious pair tear of complicated origin of nature indescribable almost indefinable except a other than of simple sorrow assuredly wonted fire must have lived in fanny ash when event be so shaped a to chariot hither in natural unobtrusive yet effectual manner one feat alonethat of dyingby mean condition must be resolved into grand one fanny have achieved to have destiny subjoined rencounter to night have in bathsheba wild imagining turned companion failure to success humiliation to triumph lucklessness to ascendency have thrown over garish light of mockery set upon thing about ironical smile fanny face be framed in by yellow hair of hers there be longer much room for doubt a to origin of curl owned by troy in bathsheba heated innocent white countenance expressed dim triumphant consciousness of pain be retaliating for pain with merciless rigour of mosaic law burning for burning wound for wound strife for strife bathsheba indulged in contemplation of escape from position by immediate death thought though be inconvenient awful way have limit to inconvenience awfulness must not be overpassed whilst shame of life be measureless yet even scheme of extinction by death be tamely copying rival method without reason have glorified in rival case glided rapidly up down room a be mostly habit when excited hand hanging clasped in front of a thought in part expressed in broken word oh hate yet dont mean hate for be grievous wicked yet hate little yes flesh insists upon hating whether spirit be willing if have only lived must have be angry cruel towards with justification to be vindictive towards poor dead woman recoil upon o god have mercy be miserable at bathsheba became at moment so terrified at own state of mind that looked around for sort of refuge from vision of oak kneeling down night recurred to with imitative instinct animates woman seized upon idea resolved to kneel if possible pray gabriel have prayed so must knelt beside coffin covered face with hand for time room be silent a tomb whether from purely mechanical from other cause when bathsheba arose be with quieted spirit regret for antagonistic instinct have seized upon just before in desire to make atonement took flower from vase by window began laying around dead girl head bathsheba knew other way of showing kindness to person departed than by giving flower knew not how long remained engaged thus forgot time life where be what be doing slamming together of coach house door in yard brought to herself again instant after front door opened closed step crossed hall husband appeared at entrance to room looking in upon beheld by degree stared in stupefaction at scene a if thought illusion raised by fiendish incantation bathsheba pallid a corpse on end gazed back at in same wild way so little be instinctive guess fruit of legitimate induction at moment a stood with door in hand troy never once thought of fanny in connection with what saw first confused idea be that somebody in house have died wellwhat said troy blankly must go must go said bathsheba to herself more than to came with dilated eye towards door to push past whats matter in god name who dead said troy can not say let go out want air continued stay insist seized hand then volition seemed to leave went off into state of passivity still holding came up room thus hand in hand troy bathsheba approached coffin side candle be standing on bureau close by light slanted down distinctly enkindling cold feature within troy looked in dropped wife hand knowledge of came over in lurid sheen stood still so still remained that must be imagined to have left in motive power whatever clash of feeling in direction confounded one produced neutrality there be motion in none do know said bathsheba in small enclosed echo a from interior of cell do said troy be be have originally stood perfectly erect now in well nigh congealed immobility of frame must be discerned incipient movement a in darkest night may be discerned light after while be gradually sinking forward line of feature softened dismay modulated to illimitable sadness bathsheba be regarding from other side still with parted lip distracted eye capacity for intense feeling be proportionate to general intensity of nature perhaps in fanny suffering much greater relatively to strength there never be time suffered in absolute sense what bathsheba suffered now be what troy did sank upon knee with indefinable union of remorse reverence upon face bending over fanny robin gently kissed a one must kiss infant asleep to avoid awakening illustration bending over fanny robin gently kissed at sight sound of to unendurable act bathsheba sprang towards strong feeling have be scattered over existence since knew what feeling be seemed gathered together into one pulsation now revulsion from indignant mood little earlier when have meditated upon compromised honour forestalment eclipse by be violent entire be forgotten in simple still strong attachment of wife to husband have sighed for self completeness then now cried aloud against severance of union have deplored flung arm round troy neck exclaiming wildly from deepest deep of heart dontdont kiss oh frank cant bear iti cant love better than did kiss too frankkiss will frank kiss too there be something so abnormal startling in childlike pain simplicity of appeal from woman of bathsheba calibre independence that troy loosening tightly clasped arm from neck looked at in bewilderment be such unexpected revelation of woman being alike at heart even so different in accessory a fanny one beside that troy must hardly seem to believe to be proud wife bathsheba fanny own spirit seemed to be animating frame be mood of few instant only when momentary surprise have passed expression changed to silencing imperious gaze will not kiss said pushing away have wife now gone further yet perhaps under harrowing circumstance to speak out be one wrong act can be better understood if not forgiven in than right politic one feeling have be betrayed into showing drew back to herself again by strenuous effort of self command what have to say a reason asked bitter voice being strangely lowquite that of woman now have to say have be bad black hearted man answered that woman be victim not le than ah dont taunt madam woman be more to dead a be than ever be be can be if satan have not tempted with face of yours cursed coquetry must have married never have thought till came in way must to god have be all too late deserve to live in torment for turned to fanny then never mind darling said in sight of heaven be very very wife at word there arose from bathsheba lip long low cry of measureless despair indignation wail of anguish a have never before be heard within old inhabited wall be of union with troy if shesthatwhatam added a continuation of same cry sobbing fearfully rarity with of such abandonment only made condition more terrible be nothing to menothing said troy heartlessly ceremony before priest doesnt make marriage be not morally yours vehement impulse to flee from to run from place hide escape humiliation at price not stopping short of death mastered bathsheba now waited not instant turned to door ran out chapter xiv under treereaction bathsheba went along dark road knowing caring about direction issue of flight first time that definitely noticed position be when reached gate leading into thicket overhung by large oak beech tree on looking into place occurred to that have seen by daylight on previous occasion that what appeared like impassable thicket be in reality brake of fern now withering fast must think of nothing better to do with palpitating than to go in here hide entering lighted on spot sheltered from damp fog by reclining trunk where sank down upon tangled couch of frond stem mechanically pulled armful round to keep off breeze closed eye whether slept not that night bathsheba be not clearly aware be with freshened existence cooler brain that long time afterwards became conscious of interesting proceeding be going on in tree above head around coarse throated chatter be first sound be sparrow just waking next chee weeze weeze weeze from retreat be finch third tink tink tink tink chink from hedge be robin chuck chuck chuck overhead squirrel then from road with ra ta ta rum tum tum be ploughboy presently came opposite believed from voice that be one of boy on own farm be followed by shambling tramp of heavy foot looking through fern bathsheba must just discern in wan light of daybreak team of own horse stopped to drink at pond on other side of way watched flouncing into pool drinking tossing up head drinking again water dribbling from lip in silver thread there be flounce came out of pond turned back again towards farm looked further around day be just dawning beside cool air colour heated action resolve of night stood out in lurid contrast perceived that in lap clinging to hair be red yellow leaf have come down from tree settled silently upon during partial sleep bathsheba shook dress to get rid of when multitude of same family lying round about rose fluttered away in breeze thus created like ghost from enchanter fleeing there be opening towards east glow from a yet unrisen sun attracted eye thither from foot between beautiful yellowing fern with feathery arm ground sloped downwards to hollow in be specie of swamp dotted with fungi morning mist hung over nowa fulsome yet magnificent silvery veil full of light from sun yet semi opaquethe hedge behind being in measure hidden by hazy luminousness up side of depression grew sheaf of common rush here there peculiar specie of flag blade of glistened in emerging sun like scythe general aspect of swamp be malignant from moist poisonous coat seemed to be exhaled essence of evil thing in earth in water under earth fungi grew in manner of position from rotting leaf tree stump exhibiting to listless gaze clammy top others oozing gill be marked with great splotch red a arterial blood others be saffron yellow others tall attenuated with stem like macaroni be leathery of richest brown hollow seemed nursery of pestilence small great in immediate neighbourhood of comfort health bathsheba arose with tremor at thought of having passed night on brink of so dismal place there be now other footstep to be heard along road bathsheba nerve be still unstrung crouched down out of sight again pedestrian came into view be schoolboy with bag slung over shoulder containing dinner book in hand paused by gate without looking up continued murmuring word in tone quite loud enough to reach ear o lord o lord o lord o lord o lordthat know out o book give give give give give usthat know grace grace grace that grace thatthat know other word followed to same effect boy be of dunce class apparently book be psalter be way of learning collect in worst attack of trouble there appears to be always superficial film of consciousness be left disengaged open to notice of trifle bathsheba be faintly amused at boy method till too passed on by time stupor have given place to anxiety anxiety began to make room for hunger thirst form now appeared upon rise on other side of swamp half hidden by mist came towards bathsheba femalefor be femaleapproached with face askance a if looking earnestly on side of when got little further round to left drew nearer bathsheba must see new comer profile against sunny sky knew wavy sweep from forehead to chin with angle decisive line anywhere about to be familiar contour of liddy smallbury bathsheba heart bounded with gratitude in thought that be not altogether deserted jumped up o liddy said attempted to say word have only be framed by lip there came sound have lost voice by exposure to clogged atmosphere hour of night oh maam be so glad have found said girl a soon a saw bathsheba cant come across bathsheba said in whisper vainly endeavoured to make loud enough to reach liddys ear liddy not knowing stepped down upon swamp saying a did so will bear up think bathsheba never forgot that transient little picture of liddy crossing swamp to there in morning light iridescent bubble of dank subterranean breath rose from sweating sod beside waiting maid foot a trod hissing a burst expanded away to join vapoury firmament above liddy did not sink a bathsheba have anticipated landed safely on other side looked up at beautiful though pale weary face of young mistress poor thing said liddy with tear in eye do hearten up little maam however did cant speak above

designated a indifference belonged to certainty of position be so well defined reasonable probability of issue so bounded that must not speculate on contingency taking further interest in a splendid woman acquired indifferent feeling of outsider in contemplating probable fate a singular wretch for bathsheba drew future in colour that reality must exceed for darkness original vigorous pride of

shown for matter very little must be deserved once out of farm approach of poverty must be sure hence bathsheba lived in perception that purpose be broken off be not woman who must hope on without good material for process differing thus from le far sighted energetic though more petted one of sex with whom hope go on a sort of clockwork merest food shelter be sufficient to wind up perceiving clearly that mistake have be fatal one accepted position waited coldly for end first saturday after troy departure went to casterbridge alone journey have not before taken since marriage on saturday bathsheba be passing slowly on foot through crowd of rural business men gathered a usual in front of market house who be a usual gazed upon by burgher with feeling healthy life be dearly paid for by lack of possible aldermanship when man who have apparently be following said word to on left hand bathsheba ear be keen a of wild animal distinctly heard what speaker said though back be towards be looking for mr troy be that there yes thats young lady believe said person addressed have awkward news to break to husband be drowned a if endowed with spirit of prophecy bathsheba gasped out oh be

almost immediately that notion that anything death must have prevented be never entertained then bathsheba said to herself that others be assured in opinion why must not be strange reflection occurred to causing face to flush troy have left followed fanny into world have done intentionally yet contrived to make death appear like accident oddly enough thought of how apparent might differ from realmade vivid by bygone jealousy of fanny remorse have shown that nightblinded to perception of other possible difference le tragic to herself far more terrible when alone late that evening beside

bathsheba recent act of promotion not farmer proposed at interview that gabriel must undertake superintendence of lower farm a well a of bathsheba because of necessity boldwood felt for such aid impossibility of discovering more trustworthy man gabriel malignant star be assuredly setting fast bathsheba when learnt of proposalfor oak be obliged to consult herat first languidly objected considered that two farm together be too extensive for observation of one man boldwood who be apparently determined by personal rather than commercial reason suggested that oak must be furnished with horse for sole use when plan must present difficulty two farm lying side by side boldwood did not directly communicate with during negotiation only speaking to oak who be go between throughout be

indifferent to public opinion man who clung persistently to old habit usage simply because be old there be room for doubt a to motif great hope have latterly germinated in boldwood whose unreasoning devotion to bathsheba must only be characterized a fond madness time circumstance evil good report must weaken destroy fevered hope have grown up again like grain of mustard seed during quiet followed universal belief that troy be drowned nourished fearfully almost shunned contemplation of in earnest lest fact must reveal wildness of dream bathsheba having at last be persuaded to wear mourning appearance a entered church in guise be in weekly addition to faith that time be comingvery far off perhaps yet surely nearingwhen waiting on event must have reward how long might have to wait have not yet closely considered what must try to recognize be that severe schooling have be subjected to have made bathsheba much more considerate than have formerly be of feeling of others trusted must be

whose assistance in such case be always accepted a inalienable right oak be nowhere to be seen hence be that said then if will just look in first to see if there room think will go in for minute two so short time after bathsheba appeared in tent with boldwood at elbow who taking to reserved seat again withdrew feature consisted of one raised bench in very conspicuous part of circle covered with red cloth floored with piece of carpet bathsheba immediately found to confusion that be single reserved individual in tent rest of crowded spectator one standing on leg on border of arena where got twice a good view of performance for money hence a many eye be turned upon enthroned alone in place of honour against scarlet background a upon pony clown who be engaged in preliminary exploit in centre turpin not having yet appeared once there bathsheba be forced to make best of remain sat down spreading skirt with dignity over unoccupied space on side of giving new feminine aspect to pavilion in few minute noticed fat red nape of coggans neck among standing just below joseph poorgrasss saintly profile little further on interior be shadowy with peculiar shade strange luminous semi opacity of fine autumn afternoon eve intensified into rembrandt effect few yellow sunbeam came through hole division in canvas spirted like jet of gold dust across dusky blue atmosphere of haze pervading tent until alighted on inner surface of cloth opposite shone like little lamp suspended there troy on peeping from dressing tent through slit for reconnoitre before entering saw unconscious wife on high before a described sitting a queen of tournament started back in utter confusion for although disguise effectually concealed personality instantly felt that must be sure to recognize voice have several time during day thought of possibility of weatherbury person other appearing recognizing have taken risk carelessly if see let have said here be bathsheba in own person reality of scene be so much intenser than of prefigurings that felt have not half enough considered point looked so charming fair that cool mood about weatherbury people be changed have not expected to exercise power over in twinkling of eye must go on care nothing must not bring to do beyond politic wish to remain unknown there suddenly arose in now sense of shame at possibility that attractive young wife who already despised must despise more by discovering in so mean condition after so long time actually blushed at thought be vexed beyond measure that sentiment of dislike towards weatherbury must have led to dally about country in way troy be never more clever than when absolutely at wit end hastily thrust aside curtain dividing own little dressing space from of manager proprietor who now appeared a individual called tom king a far down a waist aforesaid respectable manager thence to toe here d to pay said troy hows why there good for nothing scamp in tent dont want to see wholl discover nab a sure a satan if open mouth whats to be done must appear now think cant play must proceed do give out turpin have got bad cold cant speak part hell perform just same without speaking proprietor shook head anyhow play play wont open mouth said troy firmly very well then let see tell how well manage said other who perhaps felt must be extremely awkward to offend leading man just at time wont tell anything about keeping silence go on with piece say nothing doing what can by judicious wink now then few indomitable nod in heroic place know theyll never find out that speech be omitted seemed feasible enough for turpin speech be not many long fascination of piece lying entirely in action accordingly play began at appointed time black be leapt into grassy circle amid plaudit of spectator at turnpike scene where be turpin be hotly pursued at midnight by officer half awake gatekeeper in tasselled nightcap denies that horseman have passed coggan uttered broad chested well done must be heard over fair above bleating poorgrass smiled delightedly with nice sense of dramatic contrast between hero who coolly leap gate halting justice in form of enemy who must need pull up cumbersomely wait to be let through at death of tom king must not refrain from seizing coggan by hand whispering with tear in eye of course he not really shot janonly seemingly when last sad scene came on body of gallant faithful be have to be carried out on shutter by twelve volunteer from among spectator nothing must restrain poorgrass from lending hand exclaiming a asked jan to join twill be something to tell of at warren in future year jan hand down to child for many year in weatherbury joseph told with air of man who have have experience in time that touched with own hand hoof of be a lay upon board upon shoulder if a thinker hold immortality consists in being enshrined in others memory then did black be become immortal that day if never have done so before meanwhile troy have added few touch to ordinary make up for character more effectually to disguise though have felt faint qualm on first entering metamorphosis effected by judiciously lining face with wire rendered safe from eye of bathsheba men nevertheless be relieved when be got through there second performance in evening tent be lighted up troy have taken part very quietly time venturing to introduce few speech on occasion be just concluding when whilst standing at edge of circle contiguous to first row of spectator observed within yard of eye of man darted keenly into side feature troy hastily shifted position after having recognized in scrutineer knavish bailiff pennyways wife sworn enemy who still hung about outskirt of weatherbury at first troy resolved to take notice abide by circumstance that have be recognized by man be highly probable yet there be room for doubt then great objection have felt to allowing news of proximity to precede to weatherbury in event of return based on feeling that knowledge of present occupation must discredit still further in wife eye returned in full force moreover must resolve not to return at tale of being alive being in neighbourhood must be awkward be anxious to acquire knowledge of wife temporal affair before deciding to do in dilemma troy at once went out to reconnoitre occurred to that to find pennyways make friend of if possible must be very wise act have put on thick beard borrowed from establishment in wandered about fair field be now almost dark respectable people be getting cart gig ready to go home largest refreshment booth in fair

quite cozy luxurious show with urn silver tea coffee pot china teacup plum cake troy stood at entrance to booth where gipsy woman be frying pancake over little fire of stick selling at penny piece looked over head of people within must see nothing of pennyways soon discerned bathsheba through opening into reserved space at further end troy thereupon retreated went round tent into darkness listened must hear bathsheba voice immediately inside canvas be conversing with man warmth overspread face surely be not so unprincipled a to flirt in fair wondered if then reckoned upon death a absolute certainty to get at root of matter troy took penknife from pocket softly made two little cut crosswise in cloth by folding back corner left hole size of wafer close to placed face withdrawing again in movement of surprise for eye have be within twelve inch of top of bathsheba head be too near to be convenient made hole little to one side lower down in shaded place beside chair from be easy safe to survey by looking horizontally troy took in scene completely now be leaning back sipping cup of tea that held in hand owner of male voice be boldwood who have apparently just brought cup to bathsheba being in negligent mood leant so idly against canvas that be pressed to shape of shoulder be in fact a good a in troy arm be obliged to keep breast carefully backward that might not feel warmth through cloth a gazed in troy found unexpected chord of feeling to be stirred again within a have be stirred earlier in day be handsome a ever be be minute before must counteract sudden wish to go in claim then thought how proud girl who have always looked down upon even whilst be to love must hate on discovering to be strolling player be to make known that chapter of life must at risk be kept for ever from from weatherbury people name must be byword throughout parish must be nicknamed turpin a long a lived assuredly before must claim few past month of existence must be entirely blotted out will get cup before start maam said farmer boldwood thank said bathsheba must be going at once be great neglect in man to keep waiting here till so late must have gone two hour ago if have not be for have idea of coming in here there nothing so refreshing a cup of tea though must never have got one if hadnt helped troy scrutinized cheek a lit by candle watched varying shade thereon white shell like sinuosity of little ear took out purse be insisting to boldwood on paying for tea for herself when at moment pennyways entered tent troy trembled here be scheme for respectability endangered at once be about to leave hole of espial attempt to follow pennyways find out if ex bailiff have recognized when be arrested by conversation found be too late excuse maam said pennyways ive private information for ear alone can not hear now said coldly that bathsheba must not endure man be evident in fact be continually coming to with tale other by might creep into favour at expense of person maligned ill write down said pennyways confidently stooped over table pulled leaf from warped pocket book wrote upon paper in round hand husband be here ive seen who fool now folded small handed towards bathsheba must not read must not even put out hand to take pennyways then with laugh of derision tossed into lap turning away left from word action of pennyways troy though have not be able to see what ex bailiff wrote have not moment doubt that note referred to nothing that must think of must be done to check exposure curse luck whispered added imprecation rustled in gloom like pestilent wind meanwhile boldwood said taking up note from lap dont wish to read troy if not ill destroy oh well said bathsheba carelessly perhaps be unjust not to read can guess what be about want to recommend be to tell of little scandal connected with workpeople he always doing that bathsheba held note in right hand boldwood handed towards plate of cut bread butter when in order to take slice put note into left hand where be still holding purse then allowed hand to drop beside close to canvas moment have come for saving game troy impulsively felt that must play card for yet time looked at fair hand saw pink finger tip blue vein of wrist encircled by bracelet of coral chipping wore how familiar be to then with lightning action in be such adept noiselessly slipped hand under bottom of tent cloth be far from being pinned tightly down lifted little way keeping eye to hole snatched note from finger dropped canvas ran away in gloom towards bank ditch smiling at scream of astonishment burst from troy then slid down on outside of rampart hastened round in bottom of entrenchment to distance of hundred yard ascended again crossed boldly in slow walk towards front entrance of tent object be now to get to pennyways prevent repetition of announcement until such time a must choose troy reached tent door standing among group there gathered looked anxiously for pennyways evidently not wishing to make prominent by inquiring for one two men be speaking of daring attempt have just be made to rob young lady by lifting canvas of tent beside be supposed that rogue have imagined slip of paper held in hand to be bank note for have seized made off with leaving purse behind chagrin disappointment at discovering worthlessness must be good joke be said however occurrence seemed to have become known to few for have not interrupted fiddler who have lately begun playing by door of tent four bowed old men with grim countenance walking stick in hand who be dancing major malleys reel to tune behind stood pennyways troy glided up to beckoned whispered few word with mutual glance of concurrence two men went into night together chapter xxi bathsheba talk with outrider arrangement for

sight have quite depressed evening have reminded her of folly wished anew a have wished many month ago for mean of making reparation for fault hence pity for man who so persistently loved on to own injury permanent gloom have betrayed bathsheba into injudicious considerateness of manner appeared almost like tenderness gave new vigour to exquisite dream of jacob seven year service in poor boldwoods mind soon found excuse for advancing from position in rear rode close by side have gone two three mile in moonlight speaking desultorily across wheel of gig concerning fair farming oak usefulness to other indifferent subject when boldwood said suddenly simply mr troy will marry again day point blank query unmistakably confused be not till minute more have elapsed that said have not

promise without feeling just in friendliness to marry at end of six year be great honour to if value act of friendship from woman who doesnt esteem a did have little love left why ii will promise consider if can not promise soon soon be perhaps never oh be not mean soon christmas well say christmas said nothing further till added well ill say more to about till that time bathsheba be in very peculiar state of mind showed how entirely soul be slave of body ethereal spirit dependent for quality upon tangible flesh blood be hardly too much to say that felt coerced by force stronger than own will not only into act of promising upon singularly remote vague matter into emotion of fancying that ought to promise when week intervening between night of conversation christmas day began perceptibly to diminish anxiety perplexity increased one day be led by accident into oddly confidential dialogue with gabriel about difficulty afforded little reliefof dull cheerless kind be auditing account something occurred in course of labour led oak to say speaking of boldwood hell never forget maam never then out came trouble before be aware told how have again got into toil what boldwood have asked how be expecting assent most mournful reason of for agreeing to said sadly true reason why think to do so for good for evil be thisit be thing have not breathed to living soul a yeti believe that if dont give word hell go out of mind really do ye said gabriel gravely believe continued with reckless frankness heaven know say in spirit very reverse of vain for be grieved troubled to soul about iti believe hold man future in hand career depends entirely upon treatment of o gabriel tremble at responsibility for be terrible well think much maam a told year ago said oak that life be total blank whenever isnt hoping for cant supposei hope that nothing so dreadful hang on to a fancy natural manner have always be dark strange know since case be so sad odd like why dont ye give conditional promise think must be right rash act of past life have taught that watched woman must have very much circumspection to retain only very little credit do want long to be discreet in six yearswhy may be in graf by time indeed long time uncertainty of whole thing give sort of absurdity to scheme now isnt preposterous gabriel however came to dream of can not think be wrong knowyou be older than eight year older maam yes eight yearsand be wrong perhaps must be uncommon agreement for man woman to make dont see anything really wrong about said oak slowly in fact very thing that make doubtful if ought to marry en under condition be not caring about himfor may suppose yes may suppose that love be wanting said shortly love be utterly bygone sorry worn out miserable thing with mefor one else well want of love seems to one thing take away harm from such agreement with if wild heat have to do wi making ye long to overcome awkwardness about husband death might be wrong cold hearted agreement to oblige man seems different somehow real sin maam in mind lie in thinking of ever wedding with man dont love honest true that im willing to pay penalty of said bathsheba firmly know gabriel be what can not get off consciencethat once seriously injured in sheer idleness if have never played trick upon must never have wanted to marry oh if must only pay heavy damage in money to for harm did so get sin off soul way well there debt can only be discharged in one way believe be bound to do if honestly lie in power without consideration of own future at when rake gamble away expectation fact that be inconvenient debt doesnt make le liable ive be rake single point ask be considering that own scruple fact that in eye of law husband be only missing will keep man from marrying until seven year have passedam free to entertain such idea even though ti sort of penancefor will be that hate act of marriage under such circumstance class of woman must seem to belong to by doing seems to that depends upon wher think a everybody else doe that husband be dead yesive long ceased to doubt well know what must have brought back long before time if have lived well then in religious sense must be a free to think o marrying again a other widow of one year standing why dont ye ask mr thirdlys advice on how to treat mr boldwood when want broad minded opinion for general enlightenment distinct from special advice never go to man who deal in subject professionally so like parson opinion on law lawyer on doctoring doctor on business business mansthat be yourson moral on love own im afraid there hitch in argument said oak with grave smile did not reply at once then saying good evening mr oak went away have spoken frankly asked expected reply from gabriel more satisfactory than have obtained yet in centremost part of complicated heart there existed at minute little pang of disappointment for reason must not allow to recognize oak have not once wished free that might marry himselfhad not once said must wait for a well a be insect sting not that must have listened to such hypothesis oh nofor wasnt saying time that such thought of future be improper wasnt gabriel far too poor man to speak sentiment to yet might have just hinted about old love of asked in playful off hand way if might speak of must have seemed pretty sweet if more then must have shown how kind inoffensive woman can sometimes be to give such cool advicethe very advice have asked forit ruffled heroine afternoon chapter xxii converging course christmas eve came party that boldwood be

morally responsible for later act now became general fact elicited previous to trial have pointed strongly in same direction have not be of sufficient weight to lead to order for examination into state of boldwoods mind be astonishing now that presumption of insanity be raised how many collateral circumstance be remembered to condition of mental disease seemed to afford only explanationamong others unprecedented neglect of corn stack in previous summer petition be addressed to home secretary advancing circumstance appeared to justify request for reconsideration of sentence be not numerously signed by inhabitant of casterbridge a be usual in such case for boldwood have never made many friend over counter shop thought very natural that man who by importing direct from producer have daringly set aside first great principle of provincial existence namely that god made country village to supply customer to county town must have confused idea about decalogue prompter be few merciful men who have perhaps too feelingly considered fact latterly unearthed result be that evidence be taken be hoped might remove crime in moral point of view out of category of wilful murder lead

nearly opposite to churchyard bathsheba heard singing inside church knew that singer be practising opened gate crossed road entered graveyard high sill of church window effectually screening from eye of gathered within stealthy walk be to nook wherein troy have worked at planting flower upon fanny robin grave came to marble tombstone motion of satisfaction enlivened face a read complete inscription first came word of troy erected by francis troy in memory of fanny robin who died october aged year underneath be now inscribed in new letter in same grave lie remains of aforesaid francis

bathsheba be stirred by emotion latterly have assumed to be altogether dead within little attenuated voice of child brought to ear in distinct utterance word sang without thought comprehension lead kindly light amid encircling gloom lead thou on bathsheba feeling be always to extent dependent upon whim a be case with many other woman something big came into throat uprising to eyesand thought that must allow imminent tear to flow if wished did flow plenteously one fell upon stone bench beside once that have begun to cry for hardly knew what must not leave off for crowding thought knew too well must have given anything in world to be a child be unconcerned at meaning of word because too innocent to feel necessity for such expression impassioned scene of brief experience seemed to revive with added emotion at moment scene have be without emotion during enactment have emotion then yet grief came to rather a luxury than a scourge of former time owing to bathsheba face being buried in hand did not notice form came quietly into porch on seeing first moved a if to retreat then paused regarded bathsheba did not raise head for time when looked round face be wet eye drowned dim mr oak exclaimed disconcerted how long have be here few minute maam said oak respectfully be going in said bathsheba there came from within church a from prompter loved garish day in spite of fear pride ruled will remember not past year be said gabriel be one of bass singer know have sung bass for several month indeed wasnt aware of ill leave then have loved long since lost awhile sang child dont let drive away mistress think wont go in to night oh noyou dont drive away then stood in state of embarrassment bathsheba trying to wipe dreadfully drenched inflamed face without noticing at length oak said ive not seen youi mean spoken to yousince ever so long have feared to bring distressing memory back interrupted with be going into church said came to see tombstone privatelyto see if have cut inscription a wished mr oak neednt mind speaking to if wish to on matter be in mind at moment have done a wished said oak yes come see if have not already so together went read tomb eight month ago

what will do without oh gabriel dont think ought to go away youve be with so longthrough bright time dark timessuch old friend a arethat seems unkind almost have fancied that if leased other farm a master might still give helping look across at mine now going away must have willingly yet now that be more helpless than ever go away yes thats ill fortune o said gabriel in distressed tone be because of very helplessness that feel bound to go good afternoon maam concluded in evident anxiety to get away at once went out of churchyard by path must follow on pretence bathsheba went home mind occupied with new trouble being rather harassing than deadly be calculated to do good by diverting from chronic gloom of life be set thinking great deal about oak of wish to shun there occurred to bathsheba several incident of latter intercourse with trivial when singly viewed amounted together to perceptible disinclination for society broke upon at length a great pain that last old disciple be about to forsake flee who have believed in argued on side when rest of world be against have at last like others become weary neglectful of old cause be leaving to fight battle alone three week went on more evidence of want of interest in be forthcoming noticed that instead of entering small parlour office where farm account be kept waiting leaving memorandum a have hitherto done during seclusion oak never came at when be likely to be there only entering at unseasonable hour when presence in part of house be least to be expected whenever wanted direction sent message note with heading signature to be obliged to reply in same off hand style poor bathsheba began to suffer now from most torturing sting of alla sensation that be despised autumn wore away gloomily enough amid melancholy conjecture christmas day came completing year of legal widowhood two year quarter of life alone on examining heart appeared beyond measure strange that subject of season might have be supposed suggestivethe event in hall at boldwoodswas not agitating at instead agonizing conviction that everybody abjured herfor what must not telland that oak be ringleader of recusant coming out of church that day looked round in hope that oak whose bass voice have heard rolling out from gallery overhead in most unconcerned manner might chance to linger in path in old way there be a usual coming up path behind on seeing bathsheba turn looked aside a soon a got beyond gate there be barest excuse for divergence made one vanished next morning brought culminating stroke have be expecting long be formal notice by letter from that must not renew engagement with for following lady day bathsheba actually sat cried over letter most bitterly be aggrieved wounded that possession of hopeless love from gabriel have grown to regard a inalienable right for life must have be withdrawn just at own pleasure in way be bewildered too by prospect of having to rely on own resource again seemed to herself that never must again acquire energy sufficient to go to market barter sell since troy death oak have attended sale fair for transacting business at same time with own what must do now life be becoming desolation so desolate be bathsheba evening that in absolute hunger for pity sympathy miserable in appeared to have outlived only true friendship have ever owned put on bonnet cloak went down to oak house just after sunset guided on way by pale primrose ray of crescent moon few day old lively firelight shone from window nobody be visible in room tapped nervously then thought doubtful if be right for single woman to call upon bachelor who lived alone although be manager might be supposed to call on business without real impropriety gabriel opened door moon shone upon forehead mr oak said bathsheba faintly yes be mr oak said gabriel who have honouroh how stupid of not to know mistress will not be mistress much longer will gabriel said in pathetic tone well supposebut come in maam ohand

have wood seat be rather hard iwas thinking of getting new one oak placed two three for be quite easy enough for so down sat down sat fire dancing in face upon few worn out trap sheenen with long year of handlen formed oak array of household possession sent back dancing reflection in reply be very odd to two person who knew other passing well that mere circumstance of meeting in new place in new way must make so awkward constrained in field at house there have never be embarrassment now that oak have become entertainer life seemed to be moved back again to day when be stranger youll think strange have come oh not at thoughtgabriel have be uneasy in belief have offended that be going away on account grieved very much couldnt help coming offended a if must do bathsheba havent asked gladly what be going away for else be not going to emigrate know wasnt aware that must wish not to when told ye shouldnt have thought of doing said simply have arranged for lower farm will have in own

poor boldwoods farm with thought of getting day getting what doe mean marrying o ye in plain british asked to tell so mustnt blame bathsheba did not look quite so alarmed a if cannon have be discharged by ear be what oak have expected marrying didnt know be that meant said quietly such thing a be too absurdtoo soonto think of by far yes of course be too absurd dont desire such thing must think be visible enough by time surely surely be last person in world think of marrying be too absurd a say toos s soon be word used must beg pardon for correcting said too absurd so do beg pardon too returned with tear in eye too soon be what said doesnt matter bitnot at allbut only meant too soon indeed didnt mr oak must believe gabriel looked long in face firelight being faint there be not much to be seen bathsheba said tenderly in surprise coming closer if only knew one thingwhether must allow to love win marry after allif only knew that never will know murmured why because never ask ohoh said gabriel with low laugh of joyousness own dear ought not to have sent that harsh letter morning interrupted show didnt care bit about be ready to desert like rest of be very cruel of considering be first sweetheart that ever have be first ever have will not forget now bathsheba be ever anybody so provoking said laughing know be purely that a unmarried man carrying on business for a very taking young woman have proper hard part to playmore particularly that people knew have sort of feeling for ye fancied from way be mentioned together that might injure good name nobody know heat fret

long day be hard to begrudge one visit accompanied up hill explaining to detail of forthcoming tenure of lower farm spoke very little of mutual feeling pretty phrase warm expression being probably unnecessary between such tried friend theirs be that substantial affection arises if arises at when two who be thrown together begin first by knowing rougher side of others character not best till further on romance growing up in interstice of mass of hard prosaic reality good fellowshipcamaraderieusually occurring through similarity of pursuit be unfortunately seldom superadded to love between sex because men woman associate not in labour in pleasure merely where however happy circumstance permit development compounded feeling prof to be only love be strong a deaththat love many water can not quench flood drown beside passion usually called by name be evanescent a steam chapter xxvii foggy night morningconclusion most private secret plainest wedding that be possible to have have be

nevertheless at twenty minute to ten oclock oak came out of house went up hill side with sort of stride man put out when walking in search of bride knocked bathsheba door ten minute later two large umbrella might have be seen moving from same door through mist along road to church distance be not more than hundred yard two sensible person deemed unnecessary to drive observer must have be very close indeed to discover that form under umbrella be of oak bathsheba arm in arm for first time in life oak in great coat extending to knee bathsheba in cloak reached clog yet though so plainly

what seemed like tremendous blowing of trumpet in front of house there said oak laughing knew fellow be up to something by look on face oak took up light went into porch followed by bathsheba with shawl over head ray fell upon group of male figure gathered upon gravel in front who when saw newly married couple in porch set up loud hurrah at same moment bang again went cannon in background followed by hideous clang of music from drum tambourine clarionet serpent hautboy tenor viol double bassthe only remaining relic of true original weatherbury bandvenerable worm eaten instrument have celebrated in own person victory of marlhorough under finger of forefather of who played now performer came forward marched up to front bright boy mark clark jan be at bottom of said oak come in soul

still retained sufficient afterglow from georgian gaiety prestige to lend absorbing attractiveness to romantic imaginative soul of lonely dweller inland under general name of egdon heath have be given to sombre scene of story be united typified heath of various real name to number of at least dozen being virtually one in character aspect though original unity partial unity be now somewhat disguised by intrusive strip slice brought under plough with varying degree of success planted to woodland be pleasant to dream that spot in extensive tract whose southwestern quarter be here described may be heath of traditionary king of wessexlear th july book firstthe three woman face on time make little impression saturday afternoon in november be approaching time of twilight vast tract of unenclosed wild known a egdon heath embrowned moment by moment overhead hollow stretch of whitish cloud shutting out sky be a tent have whole heath for floor heaven being spread with pallid screen earth with darkest vegetation meeting line at horizon be clearly marked in such contrast heath wore appearance of instalment of night have taken up place before astronomical hour be come darkness have to great extent arrived hereon while day stood distinct in sky looking upwards furze cutter must have be inclined to continue work looking down must have decided to finish faggot go home distant rim of world of firmament seemed to be division in time le than division in matter face of heath by mere complexion added hour to evening must in like manner retard dawn sadden noon anticipate frowning of storm scarcely generated intensify opacity of moonless midnight to cause of shaking dread in fact precisely at transitional point of nightly roll into darkness great particular glory of egdon waste began nobody must be said to understand heath who have not be there at time must best be felt when must not clearly be seen complete effect explanation lying in succeeding hour before next dawn then only then did tell true tale spot be indeed near relation of night when night showed apparent tendency to gravitate together must be perceived in shade scene sombre stretch of round hollow seemed to rise meet evening gloom in pure sympathy heath exhaling darkness a rapidly a heaven precipitated so obscurity in air obscurity in land closed together in black fraternization towards advanced place became full of watchful intentness now for when other thing sank brooding to sleep heath appeared slowly to awake listen night titanic form seemed to await something have waited thus unmoved during so many century through crisis of so many thing that must only be imagined to await one last crisisthe final overthrow be spot returned upon memory of who loved with aspect of peculiar kindly congruity smiling champaign of flower fruit hardly do for be permanently harmonious only with existence of better reputation a to issue than present twilight combined with scenery of egdon heath to evolve thing majestic without severity impressive without showiness emphatic in admonition grand in simplicity qualification frequently invest faade of prison with far more dignity than be found in faade of palace double size lent to heath sublimity in spot renowned for beauty of accepted kind be utterly wanting fair prospect wed happily with fair time ala if time be not fair men have oftener suffered from mockery of place too smiling for reason than from oppression of surroundings oversadly tinged haggard egdon appealed to subtler scarcer instinct to more recently learnt emotion than responds to sort of beauty called charming fair indeed be question if exclusive reign of orthodox beauty be not approaching last quarter new vale of tempe may be gaunt waste in thule human soul may find in closer closer harmony with external thing wearing sombreness distasteful to race when be young time seems near if have not actually arrived when chastened sublimity of moor sea mountain will be of nature be absolutely in keeping with mood of more thinking among mankind ultimately to commonest tourist spot like iceland may become what vineyard myrtle garden of south europe be to now heidelberg baden be passed unheeded a hastens from alp to sand dune of scheveningen most thoroughgoing ascetic must feel that have natural right to wander on egdonhe be keeping within line of legitimate indulgence when laid open to influence such a colour beauty so far subdued be at least birthright of only in summer day of highest feather did mood level of gaiety intensity be more usually reached by way of solemn than by way of brilliant sort of intensity be often arrived at during winter darkness tempest mist then egdon be aroused to reciprocity for storm be lover wind friend then became home of strange phantom be found to be hitherto unrecognized original of wild region of obscurity be vaguely felt to be compassing about in midnight dream of flight disaster be never thought of after dream till revived by scene like be at present place perfectly accordant with man natureneither ghastly hateful ugly commonplace unmeaning tame like man slighted enduring withal singularly colossal mysterious in swarthy monotony a with person who have long lived apart solitude seemed to look out of countenance have lonely face suggesting tragical possibility obscure obsolete superseded country figure in

from figure that area of egdon down to present day have little diminished turbaria bruariathe right of cutting heath turfoccurs in charter relating to district overgrown with heth mosse say leland of same dark sweep of country here at least be intelligible fact regarding landscapefar reaching proof productive of genuine satisfaction untameable ishmaelitish thing that egdon now be always have be civilization be enemy ever since beginning of vegetation soil have worn same antique brown dress natural invariable garment of particular formation in venerable one coat lay certain vein of satire on human vanity in clothes person on heath in raiment of modern cut colour have more le anomalous look seem to want oldest simplest human clothing where clothing of earth be so primitive to recline on stump of thorn in central valley of egdon between afternoon night a now where eye must reach nothing of world outside summit shoulder of heathland filled whole circumference of glance to know that everything around underneath have be from prehistoric time a unaltered a star overhead gave ballast to mind adrift on change harassed by irrepressible new great inviolate place have ancient permanence sea can not claim who can say of particular sea that be old distilled by sun kneaded by moon be renewed in year in day in hour sea changed field changed river village people changed yet egdon remained surface be neither so steep a to be destructible by weather so flat a to be victim of flood deposit with exception of aged highway still more aged barrow presently to be referred tothemselves almost crystallized to natural product by long continuanceeven trifling irregularity be not caused by pickaxe plough spade remained a very finger touch of last geological change above mentioned highway traversed lower level of heath from one horizon to in many portion of course overlaid old vicinal way branched from great western road of roman via iceniana ikenild street hard by on evening under consideration must have be noticed that though gloom have increased sufficiently to confuse minor feature of heath white surface of road remained almost a clear a ever ii humanity appears upon scene hand in hand with trouble along road walked old man be white headed a mountain bowed in shoulder faded in general aspect wore glazed hat ancient boat cloak shoe brass button bearing anchor upon face in hand be silver headed walking stick used a veritable third leg perseveringly dotting ground with point at few inch interval one must have said that have be in day naval officer of sort other before stretched long laborious road dry empty white be quite open to heath on side bisected that vast dark surface like parting line on head of black hair diminishing bending away on furthest horizon old man frequently stretched eye ahead to gaze over tract that have yet to traverse at length discerned long distance in front of moving spot appeared to be vehicle proved to be going same way a in be journeying be single atom of life that scene contained only served to render general loneliness more evident rate of advance be slow old man gained upon sensibly when drew nearer perceived to be spring van ordinary in shape singular in colour being lurid red driver walked beside like van be completely red one dye of tincture covered clothes cap upon head boot face hand be not temporarily overlaid with colour permeated old man knew meaning of traveller with cart be reddlemana person whose vocation be to supply farmer with redding for sheep be one of class rapidly becoming extinct in wessex filling at present in rural world place during last century dodo occupied in world of animal be curious interesting nearly perished link between obsolete form of life generally prevail decayed officer by degree came up alongside fellow wayfarer wished good evening reddleman turned head replied in sad occupied tone be young face if not exactly handsome approached so near to handsome that nobody must have contradicted assertion that really be so in natural colour eye glared so strangely through stain be in attractivekeen a of bird of prey blue a autumn mist have whisker moustache allowed soft curve of lower part of face to be apparent lip be thin though a seemed compressed by thought there be pleasant twitch at corner now then be clothed throughout in tight fitting suit of corduroy excellent in quality not much worn well chosen for purpose deprived of original colour by trade showed to advantage good shape of figure certain well to do air about man suggested that be not poor for degree natural query of observer must have be why must such promising being a have hidden prepossessing exterior by adopting that singular occupation after replying to old man greeting showed inclination to continue in talk although still walked side by side for elder traveller seemed to desire company there be sound that of booming wind upon stretch of tawny herbage around crackling wheel tread of men footstep of two shaggy pony drew van be small hardy animal of breed between galloway exmoor be known a heath cropper here now a thus pursued way reddleman occasionally left companion side stepping behind van looked into interior through small window look be always anxious must then return to old man who made remark about state of country so on to reddleman again abstractedly replied then again must lapse into silence silence conveyed to sense of awkwardness in lonely place wayfarer after first greeting frequently plod on for mile without speech contiguity amount to tacit conversation where otherwise than in city such contiguity can be put end to on merest inclination where not to put end to be intercourse in possibly two might not have spoken again till parting have not be for reddlemans visit to van when returned from fifth time of looking in old man said have something inside there besides load yes somebody who want looking after yes not long after faint cry sounded from interior reddleman hastened to back looked in came away again have child there man sir have woman deuce have why did cry out oh have fallen asleep not being used to traveling shes uneasy keep dreaming young woman yes young woman must have interested forty year ago perhaps shes wife wife said other bitterly shes above mating with such a there reason why must tell about thats true there reason why must not what harm can do to to reddleman looked in old man face well sir said at last knew before today though perhaps must have be better if have not shes nothing to be nothing to have be in van if better carriage have be there to take where may ask at anglebury know town well what be doing there oh not muchto gossip about however shes tired to death now not at well thats what make so restless dropped off into nap about hour ago twill do good nice looking girl doubt must say so other traveller turned eye with interest towards van window without withdrawing said presume might look in upon said reddleman abruptly be getting too dark for to see much of more than have right to allow thank god sleep so well hope wont wake till shes home who be one of neighbourhood ti matter who excuse be not that girl of bloom end who have be talked about more le lately if so know can guess what have happened ti matter now sir be sorry to say that will soon have to part company pony be tired have further to go be going to rest under bank for hour elder traveller nodded head indifferently reddleman turned horse van in upon turf saying good night old man replied proceeded on way a before reddleman watched form a diminished to speck on road became absorbed in thickening film of night then took hay from truss be slung up under van throwing portion of in front of horse made pad of rest laid on ground beside vehicle upon sat down leaning back against wheel from interior low soft breathing came to ear appeared to satisfy musingly surveyed scene a if considering next step that must take to do thing musingly by small degree seemed indeed to be duty in egdon valley at transitional hour for there be that in condition of heath resembled protracted halting dubiousness be quality of repose appertaining to scene be not repose of actual stagnation apparent repose of incredible slowness condition of healthy life so nearly resembling torpor of death be noticeable thing of sort to exhibit inertness of desert at same time to be exercising power akin to of meadow even of forest awakened in who thought of attentiveness usually engendered by understatement reserve scene before reddlemans eye be gradual series of ascent from level of road backward into heart of heath embraced hillock pit ridge acclivity one behind other till be finished by high hill cutting against still light sky traveller eye hovered about thing for time finally settled upon one noteworthy object up there be barrow bossy projection of earth above natural level occupied loftiest ground of loneliest height that heath contained although from vale appeared a wart on atlantean brow actual bulk be great formed pole axis of heathery world a resting man looked at barrow became aware that summit hitherto highest object in whole prospect round be surmounted by something higher rose from semiglobular mound like spike from helmet first instinct of imaginative stranger might have be to suppose person of one of celt who built barrow so far have of modern date withdrawn from scene seemed sort of last man among musing for moment before dropping into eternal night with rest of race there form stood motionless a hill beneath above plain rose hill above hill rose barrow above barrow rose figure above figure be nothing must be mapped elsewhere than on celestial globe perfect delicate necessary finish did figure give to dark pile of hill that seemed to be only obvious justification of outline without there be dome without lantern with architectural demand of mass be satisfied scene be strangely homogeneous in vale upland barrow figure above amounted only to unity looking at that member of group be not observing complete thing fraction of thing form be so much like organic part of entire motionless structure to see move must have impressed mind a strange phenomenon immobility being chief characteristic of whole person formed portion of discontinuance of immobility in quarter suggested confusion yet be happened figure perceptibly gave up fixity shifted step two turned round a if alarmed descended on right side of barrow with glide of water drop down bud then vanished movement have be sufficient to show more clearly characteristic of figure that be woman reason of sudden displacement now appeared with dropping out of sight on right side newcomer bearing burden protruded into sky on left side ascended tumulus deposited burden on top second followed then third fourth fifth ultimately whole barrow be peopled with burdened figure only intelligible meaning in sky backed pantomime of silhouette be that woman have relation to form who have taken place be sedulously avoiding have come thither for object than theirs imagination of observer clung by preference to vanished solitary figure a to something more interesting more important more likely to have history worth knowing than newcomer unconsciously regarded a intruder remained established lonely person who hitherto have be queen of solitude did not at present seem likely to return iii custom of country have looker on be posted in immediate vicinity of barrow must have learned that person be boy men of neighbouring hamlet a ascended barrow have be heavily laden with furze faggot carried upon shoulder by mean of long stake sharpened at end for impaling easilytwo in front two behind came from part of heath quarter of mile to rear where furze almost exclusively prevailed a product individual be so involved in furze by method of carrying faggot that appeared like bush on leg till have thrown down party have marched in trail like travelling flock of sheep be to say strongest first weak young behind load be laid together pyramid of furze thirty foot in circumference now occupied crown of tumulus be known a rainbarrow for many mile round made busy with match in selecting driest tuft of furze others in loosening bramble bond held faggot together others again while be in progress lifted eye swept vast expanse of country commanded by position now lying nearly obliterated by shade in valley of heath nothing save own wild face be visible at time of day spot commanded horizon enclosing tract of far extent in many case lying beyond heath country none of feature must be seen now whole made felt a vague stretch of remoteness while men lad be building pile change took place in mass of shade

dense atmosphere so that bundle of pale straw like beam radiated around in shape of fan be large near glowing scarlet red from shade like wound in black hide be mnades with winy face blown hair tinctured silent bosom of cloud above lit up ephemeral cave seemed thenceforth to become scalding caldron perhaps a many a thirty bonfire must be counted within whole bound of district a hour may be told on clock face when figure be invisible so did men recognize locality of fire by angle direction though nothing of scenery must be viewed first tall flame from rainbarrow sprang into sky attracting eye have be fixed on distant conflagration back to own attempt in same kind cheerful blaze streaked inner surface of human circlenow increased by other straggler male femalewith own gold livery even overlaid dark turf around with lively luminousness softened off into obscurity where barrow rounded downwards out of sight showed barrow to be segment of globe a perfect a on day when be thrown up even little ditch remaining from earth be dug not plough have ever disturbed grain of stubborn soil in heath barrenness to farmer lay fertility to historian there have be obliteration because there have be no tending seemed a if bonfire maker be standing in radiant upper story of world detached from independent of dark stretch below heath down there be now vast abyss no longer continuation of what stood on for eye adapted to blaze must see nothing of deep beyond influence occasionally be true more vigorous flare than usual from faggot sent darting light like aide de camp down incline to distant bush pool patch of white sand kindling to reply of same colour till be lost in darkness again then whole black phenomenon beneath represented limbo a viewed from brink by

buried be exceptional at egdon made little difference have determined upon bold stroke of asking for interview with miss vyeto attack position a thomasins rival either by art by storm showing therein somewhat too conspicuously want of gallantry characteristic of certain astute sort of men from clown to king great frederick making war on beautiful archduchess napoleon refusing term to beautiful queen of prussia be not more dead to difference of sex than reddleman be in peculiar way in planning displacement of eustacia to call at captain cottage be always more le undertaking for inferior inhabitant though occasionally chatty mood be erratic nobody must be certain how must behave at particular moment eustacia be reserved lived very much to herself except daughter of one of cotter who be servant lad who worked in garden stable scarcely anyone ever entered house be only genteel people of district except yeobrights though far from rich did not feel that necessity for preserving friendly face towards man bird beast influenced poorer neighbour when reddleman entered garden old man be looking through glass at stain of blue sea in distant landscape little anchor on button

to think that scheme have failed when beheld form of eustacia coming leisurely towards sense of novelty in giving audience to singular figure have be sufficient to draw forth seemed to feel after bare

at advent of uncommon in womankind on inquiring if might have conversation with replied walk beside continued to move on before have gone far occurred to perspicacious reddleman that must have acted more wisely by appearing le unimpressionable resolved to correct error a soon a must find opportunity have made so bold miss a to step across tell strange news have come to ear about man ah what man jerked elbow to southeastthe direction of quiet woman eustacia turned quickly to do mean mr wildeve yes there be trouble in household on account of have come to let know of because believe might have

wish to listen to must not expect to interfere miss will hear one word can not be not interested in marriage even if be must not compel mr wildeve to do bidding a only lady on heath think might said

head comeliness be law with mr wildeve be law with men who see ee say well favoured lady comingwhats name how handsome handsomer than thomasin yeobright reddleman persisted saying to god forgive rascal for lying be handsomer reddleman be far from thinking so there be certain obscurity in eustacias beauty venn eye be not trained in winter dress a now be like tiger beetle when observed in dull situation seems to be of quietest neutral colour under full illumination blaze with dazzling splendour eustacia must not help replying though conscious that endangered dignity thereby many woman be lovelier than thomasin said so not much attache to that reddleman suffered wound went on be man who notice look of woman must twist to will like withywind if only have mind surely what can not do who have be so much with can not do living up here away from reddleman wheeled looked in face miss vye said why do say thatas if doubted spoke faintly breathing be quick idea of speaking in tone to added

reddleman be surprised to see how slow fire must blaze on occasion if be miss replied in week time must think more of wildeve than of one of heth cropper that see yond now must get there how said eustacia with intense curiosity in heavy eye uncle have be for five twenty year trusty man of rich widow lady who have beautiful house facing sea lady have become old lame want young company keeper to

chance said proudly what can poor man like offer indeedi be going indoors have nothing more to say dont horse want feeding reddlebags want mending dont want to find buyer for good that stay idling here like venn spoke not word with hand behind turned away that might not see hopeless disappointment in face mental clearness power have found in lonely girl have indeed filled manner with misgiving even from first few minute of close quarter with youth situation have led to expect simplicity quite at beck of method system of inducement might have carried weaker country lass along with have merely repelled eustacia a rule word budmouth meant fascination on egdon that royal port watering place if truly mirrored in mind of heathfolk must have combined in charming indescribable manner carthaginian bustle of building with tarentine luxuriousness baian health beauty eustacia felt little le extravagantly about place must not sink independence to get there when diggory venn have gone quite away eustacia walked to bank looked down wild picturesque vale towards sun be also in direction of wildeves mist have now so far collapsed that tip of tree bush around house must just be discerned a if boring upwards through vast white cobweb cloaked from day there be doubt that mind be inclined thitherward indefinitely fancifullytwining untwining about a single object within horizon on dream might crystallize man who have begun by being merely amusement must never have be more than hobby for skill in deserting at right moment be now again desire cessation in love making have revivified love such feeling a eustacia have idly given to wildeve be dammed into flood by thomasin have used to tease wildeve be before have favoured often drop of irony into indifferent situation render whole piquant will never give upnever said impetuously reddlemans hint that rumour might show to disadvantage have permanent terror for eustacia be a unconcerned at contingency a goddess at lack of linen did not originate in inherent shamelessness in living too far from world to feel impact of public opinion zenobia in desert must hardly have cared what be said about at rome a far a social ethic be concerned eustacia approached savage state though in emotion be while epicure have advanced to secret recess of sensuousness yet have hardly crossed threshold of conventionality xi dishonesty of honest woman reddleman have left eustacias presence with desponding view on thomasins future happiness be awakened to fact that one other channel remained untried by seeing a followed way to van form of mr yeobright slowly walking towards quiet woman went across to must almost perceive in anxious face that journey of hers to wildeve be undertaken with same object a own to eustacia did not conceal fact then said reddleman may a well leave alone mr yeobright half think so said nothing else remains to be done besides pressing question upon must like to say word first said venn firmly mr wildeve be not only man who have asked thomasin to marry why must not have chance mr yeobright must be glad to marry niece must have done time last two year there now be out have never told anybody before mr yeobright be not demonstrative eye involuntarily glanced towards singular though shapely figure look be not everything said reddleman noticing glance there many calling that dont bring in so much a mine if come to money perhaps be not so much worse off than wildeve there be nobody so poor a professional fellow who have failed if shouldnt like rednesswell be not red by birth know only took to business for freak might turn hand to something else in good time be much obliged to for interest in niece fear there must be objection more than be devoted to man true shouldnt have done have morning otherwise there must be pain in case must not see going to house now what be thomasins answer when told of feeling wrote that must object to other thing be in measure right must not take unkindlyi merely state a truth have be good to forget a be unwilling on own account to be wife that settle point without wish being concerned yes there be difference between then now maam be distressed now have thought that if be to talk to about think favourably of there might be chance of winning round getting quite independent of wildeves backward forward play not knowing whether hell have mr yeobright shook head thomasin think think with that ought to be wildeves wife if mean to appear before world without slur upon name if marry soon everybody will believe that accident did really prevent wedding if not may cast shade upon characterat rate make ridiculous in short if be anyhow possible must marry now thought that till hour ago after why must going off with to anglebury for few hour do harm anybody who know how pure be will feel such thought to be quite unjust have be trying morning to help on marriage with wildeveyes maamin belief ought to do because be so wrapped up in much question if be right after however nothing came of now offer mr yeobright appeared disinclined to enter further into question fear must go on said see that anything else can be done went on though conversation did not divert thomasins aunt from purposed interview with wildeve made considerable difference in mode of conducting interview thanked god for weapon reddleman have put into hand wildeve be at home when reached inn showed silently into parlour closed door mr yeobright began have thought duty to call today new proposal have be made to have rather astonished will affect thomasin greatly have decided that must at least be mentioned to yes what be said civilly be of course in reference to future may not be aware that man have shown anxious to marry thomasin now though have not encouraged yet can not conscientiously refuse chance longer dont wish to be short with must be fair to to who be man said wildeve with surprise one who have be in love with longer than have with proposed to two year ago at time refused well have seen lately have asked for permission to pay address to may not refuse twice what be name mr yeobright declined to say be man thomasin like added one whose constancy respect at least seems to that what refused then must be glad to get now be much annoyed at awkward position never once told of old lover gentlest woman be not such fool a to show card well if want suppose must have be easy enough to say that dont see difficulty want much more than want before can encourage anything of sort must have clear understanding from that will not interfere to injure arrangement promote in belief that be for best suppose when be engaged everything be smoothly arranged for marriage that must step between renew suit might not win back might cause much unhappiness of course must do such thing said wildeve be not engaged yet how do know that thomasin must accept thats question have carefully put to upon whole probability be in favour of accepting in time flatter have influence over be pliable can be strong in recommendation of in disparagement of at same time well may depend upon not praising said drily if seems like manuvring must remember that position be peculiar that have be hardly used will also be helped in making match by own desire to escape from humiliation of present state woman pride in case will lead very great way little managing may be required to bring round be equal to provided that agree to one thing indispensable be to make distinct declaration that be to think more of a possible husband will pique into accepting can hardly say that just now mr yeobright be so sudden so whole plan be interfered with be very inconvenient that refuse to help family even to small extent of saying distinctly will have nothing to do with wildeve reflected uncomfortably confess be not prepared for said of course ill give up if wish if be necessary thought might be husband have heard that before now mr yeobright dont let disagree give fair time dont want to stand in way of better chance may have only wish have let know earlier will write to call in day two will suffice yes replied provided promise not to communicate with thomasin without knowledge promise that said interview then terminated mr yeobright returning homeward a have come by far greatest effect of simple strategy on day be a often happens in quarter quite outside view when arranging in first place visit sent wildeve same evening after dark to eustacias house at mistover at hour lonely dwelling be closely blinded shuttered from chill darkness without wildeves clandestine plan with be to take little gravel in hand hold to crevice at top of window shutter be on outside so that must fall with gentle rustle resembling that of mouse between shutter glass precaution in attracting attention be to avoid arousing suspicion of grandfather soft word hear wait for in eustacias voice from within told that be alone waited in customary manner by walking round enclosure idling by pool for wildeve be never asked into house by proud though condescending mistress showed sign of coming out in hurry time wore on began to grow impatient in course of twenty minute appeared from round corner advanced a if merely taking airing must not have kept so long have known what come about said with bitterness still be worth waiting for what have happened said eustacia did not know be in trouble too be gloomy enough be not in trouble said be merely that affair have come to head must take clear course what course be that asked with attentive interest can forget so soon what proposed to other night why take from place carry away with abroad have not forgotten why have come so unexpectedly to repeat question when only promised to come next saturday thought be to have plenty of time to consider yes situation be different now explain to dont want to explain for may pain must know reason of hurry be simply ardour dear eustacia everything be smooth now then why be so ruffled be not aware of be a must be mr yeobrightbut be nothing to ah knew have something to do with come dont like reserve noshe have nothing only say wish to give up thomasin because man be anxious to marry woman now no longer need actually show off wildeves vexation have escaped in spite of eustacia be silent long while be in awkward position of official who be longer wanted said in changed tone seems so have not yet seen thomasin that irritates dont deny damon be actually nettled by slight from unexpected quarter well come to get because can not get be certainly new position altogether be to be stop gap please remember that proposed same thing other day eustacia again remained in sort of stupefied silence what curious feeling be coming over be really possible that interest in wildeve have be so entirely result of antagonism that glory dream departed from man with first sound that be no longer coveted by rival be then secure of at last thomasin no longer required what humiliating victory loved best thought yetdared to murmur such treacherous criticism ever so softlywhat be man worth whom woman inferior to herself did not value sentiment lurks more le in animate naturethat of not desiring undesired of otherswas lively a passion in supersubtle epicurean heart of eustacia social superiority over hitherto have scarcely ever impressed became unpleasantly insistent for first time felt that have stooped in loving well darling agree said wildeve if must be london even budmouth instead of america murmured languidly well will think be too great thing for to decide offhand wish hated heath lessor loved more can be painfully frank loved month ago warmly enough to go anywhere with loved thomasin yes perhaps be where reason lay returned with almost sneer dont hate now exactly only thing be that can no longer get comeno taunt eustacia will quarrel if dont agree to go with agree shortly will go by try thomasin again damon how strange seems that must have married indifferently only have come to because amcheapest yes yesit be true there be time when must have exclaimed against man of sort be quite wild be past now will go dearest come secretly with to bristol marry turn back upon dog hole of england for ever say yes want to get away from here at almost cost said with weariness dont like to go with give more time to decide have already said wildeve well give one more week little longer so may tell decisively have to consider so many thing fancy thomasin being anxious to get rid of can not forget never mind that say monday week will be here precisely at time let be at rainbarrow said be too near home grandfather may be walking out thank dear on monday week at time will be at barrow till then good bye good bye must not touch now shaking hand be enough till have made up mind eustacia watched shadowy form till have disappeared placed hand to forehead breathed heavily then rich romantic lip parted under homely impulsea yawn be immediately angry at having betrayed even to herself possible evanescence of passion for must not admit at once that might have overestimated wildeve for to perceive mediocrity now be to admit own great folly heretofore discovery that be owner of disposition so purely that of dog in manger have something in at first made ashamed fruit of mr yeobrights diplomacy be indeed remarkable though not a yet of kind have anticipated have appreciably influenced wildeve be influencing eustacia far more lover be no longer to exciting man whom many woman strove for must only retain by striving with

extinguished candle at half past eight set out upon heath in direction of mr yeobrights house at bloom end there be slight hoarfrost night moon though not more than half full threw spirited enticing brightness upon fantastic figure of mumming band whose plume ribbon rustled in walk like autumn leaf path be not over rainbarrow now down valley left that ancient elevation little to east bottom of vale be green to width of ten yard thereabouts shining facet of frost upon blade of grass seemed to move on with shadow of surrounded mass of furze heath to right left be dark a ever mere half moon be powerless to silver such sable feature a theirs hour of walking talking brought to spot in valley where grass riband widened led down to front of house at sight of place eustacia who have felt few passing doubt during walk with youth again be glad that adventure have be undertaken have come out to see man who might possibly have power to deliver soul from most deadly oppression what be wildeve interesting inadequate perhaps must see sufficient hero tonight a drew nearer to front of house mummer became aware that music dancing be briskly flourishing within now then long low note from serpent be chief wind instrument played at time advanced further into heath than thin treble part reached ear alone next more than usual loud tread from dancer must come same way with nearer approach fragmentary sound became pieced together be found to be salient point of tune called nancy fancy be there of course who be that danced with perhaps unknown woman far beneath in culture be by most subtle of lure sealing fate very instant to dance with man be to concentrate twelvemonth regulation fire upon in fragment of hour to pas to courtship without acquaintance to pas to marriage without

open porch house be encrusted with heavy thatchings dropped between upper window front upon moonbeam directly played have originally be white huge pyracanth now darkened greater portion became at once evident that dance be proceeding immediately within surface of door apartment intervening brushing of skirt elbow sometimes bumping of shoulder must be heard against very panel eustacia though living within two mile of place have never seen interior of quaint old habitation between captain vye yeobrights there have never existed much acquaintance former having come a stranger purchased long empty house at mistover knap not long before death of mr yeobrights husband with event departure of son such friendship a have grown up became quite broken off be there passage inside door then asked a stood within porch said lad who played saracen door open right upon front sitting room where spree going on so that can not open door without stopping dance thats here must bide till have done for always bolt back door after dark wont be much longer said father christmas assertion however be hardly borne out by event again instrument ended tune again recommenced with a much fire pathos a if be first strain air be now that one without particular beginning middle end perhaps among dance throng inspired fiddler fancy best conveys idea of interminablethe celebrated devil dream fury of personal movement be kindled by fury of note must be approximately imagined by outsider under moon from occasional kick of toe heel against door whenever whirl round have be of more than customary velocity first five minute of listening be interesting enough to mummer five minute extended to ten minute to quarter of hour sign of ceasing be audible in lively dream bumping against door laughter stamping be a vigorous a ever pleasure in being outside lessened considerably why doe mr yeobright give party of sort eustacia asked little surprised to hear merriment so pronounced be not one of bettermost parlour party shes asked plain neighbour workpeople without drawing line just to give em good supper such like son wait upon folk see said eustacia ti last strain think said saint george with ear to panel young man woman have just swung into corner he saying to ah pity ti over for time own thank god said turkish knight stamping taking from wall conventional lance that of mummer carried boot being

corner waiting turn twont be long ti six handed reel said doctor why not go in dancing sent for said saracen certainly not said eustacia authoritatively a paced smartly up down from door to gate to warm must burst into middle of stop dance must be unmannerly think somebody because have have bit more schooling than said doctor may go to deuce said eustacia there be whispered conversation between three four of one turned to will tell one thing said not without gentleness be miss vye think must be may think what like said eustacia slowly honourable lad will not tell tale upon lady well say nothing miss thats upon honour thank replied at moment fiddle finished off with screech serpent emitted last note that nearly lifted roof when from comparative quiet within mummer judged that dancer have taken seat father christmas advanced lifted latch put head inside door ah mummer mummer cried several guest at once clear space for mummer humpbacked father christmas then made complete entry swinging huge club in general way clearing stage for actor proper while informed company in smart verse that be come welcome welcome not concluding speech with make room make room gallant boy give space to rhyme weve come to show saint george play upon christmas time guest be now arranging at one end of room fiddler be mending string serpent player be emptying mouthpiece play began first of outside valiant soldier entered in interest of saint george here come valiant soldier slasher be name so on speech concluded with challenge to infidel at end of be eustacias duty to enter a turkish knight with rest who be not yet on have hitherto remained in moonlight streamed under porch with apparent effort backwardness came in beginning here come turkish knight who learnt in turkish land to fight ill fight man with courage bold if blood hot ill make cold during declamation eustacia held head erect spoke a roughly a must feeling pretty secure from observation concentration upon part necessary to prevent discovery newness of scene shine of candle confusing effect upon vision of ribboned visor hid feature left absolutely unable to perceive who be present a spectator on further side of table bearing candle must faintly discern face be meanwhile jim starks a valiant soldier have come forward with glare upon turk replied if then thou art that turkish knight draw out thy sword let fight fight did issue of combat being that valiant soldier be slain by preternaturally inadequate thrust from eustacia jim in ardour for genuine histrionic art coming down like log upon stone floor with force enough to dislocate shoulder then after more word from turkish knight rather too faintly delivered statement hed fight saint george crew saint george magnificently entered with well known flourish here come saint george valiant man with naked sword spear in hand who fought dragon brought to slaughter by won fair sabra king of egypt daughter what mortal man must dare to stand before with sword in hand be lad who have first recognized eustacia when now a turk replied with suitable defiance at once began combat young fellow took especial care to use sword a gently a possible being wounded knight fell upon one knee according to direction doctor now entered restored knight by giving draught from bottle carried fight be again resumed turk sinking by degree until quite overcomedying a hard in venerable drama a be said to do at present day gradual sinking to earth be in fact one reason why eustacia have thought that part of turkish knight though not shortest must suit best direct fall from upright to horizontal be end of other fighting character be not elegant decorous part for girl be easy to die like turk by dogged decline eustacia be now among number of slain though not on floor for have managed to sink into sloping position against clock case so that head be well elevated play proceeded between saint george saracen doctor father christmas eustacia

walked out so late only in search of event grandfather said looking out of window with drowsy latency of manner discovered so much force behind whenever trigger be pressed search of eventsone must

price thought soon strayed far from own personality full of passionate indescribable solicitude for one to whom be not even name went forth into amplitude of tanned wild around restless a ahasuerus jew be about mile from residence when beheld sinister redness arising from ravine little way in advancedull lurid like flame in sunlight guessed to signify diggory venn when farmer who have wished to buy in new stock of reddle during last month have inquired where venn be to be found people replied on egdon heath day after day answer be same now since egdon be populated with heath cropper furze cutter rather than with sheep shepherd down where most of latter be to be found lay to north to west of egdon reason for camping about there like israel in zin be not apparent position be central occasionally desirable sale of reddle be not diggorys primary object in remaining on heath particularly at so late period of year when most traveller of class have gone into winter quarter eustacia looked at lonely man wildeve have told at last meeting that venn have be thrust forward by mr yeobright a one ready anxious to take place a thomasins betrothed figure be perfect face young well outlined eye bright intelligence keen position one must readily better if chose in spite of possibility be not likely that thomasin must accept ishmaelitish creature while have cousin like yeobright at elbow wildeve at same time not absolutely indifferent eustacia be not long in guessing that poor mr yeobright in anxiety for niece future have mentioned lover to stimulate zeal of other eustacia be on side of yeobrights now entered into spirit of aunt desire good morning miss said reddleman taking off cap of hareskin apparently bearing ill will from recollection of last meeting good morning reddleman said hardly troubling to lift heavily shaded eye to did not know be so near be van here too venn moved elbow towards hollow in dense brake of purple stemmed bramble have grown to such vast dimension a almost to form dell bramble though churlish when handled be kindly shelter in early winter being latest of deciduous bush to lose leaf roof chimney of venn caravan showed behind tracery tangle of brake remain near part asked with more interest yes have business here not altogether selling of reddle have nothing to do with have to do with miss yeobright face seemed to ask for armed peace therefore said frankly yes miss be on account of on account of approaching marriage with venn flushed through stain dont make sport of miss vye said isnt true certainly not be thus convinced that reddleman be mere pi aller in mr yeobrights mind one moreover who have not even be informed of promotion to lowly standing be mere notion of mine said quietly be about to pas by without further speech when looking round to right saw painfully well known figure serpentining upwards by one of little path led to top where stood owing to necessary winding of course back be at present towards glanced quickly round to escape man there be only one way turning to venn said must allow to rest few minute in van bank be damp for sitting on certainly miss ill make place for followed behind dell of bramble to wheeled dwelling into venn mounted placing three legged stool just within door be best can do for said stepping down retiring to path where resumed smoking of pipe a walked up down eustacia bounded into vehicle sat on stool ensconced from view on side towards trackway soon heard brushing of other foot than reddlemans not very friendly good day uttered by two men in passing other then dwindling of foot fall of one of in direction onwards eustacia stretched neck forward till caught glimpse of receding back shoulder felt wretched twinge of misery knew not why be sickening feeling if changed heart have generosity at in composition accompanies sudden sight of once loved one who be beloved no more when eustacia descended to proceed on way reddleman came near be mr wildeve who passed miss said slowly expressed by face that expected to feel vexed at having be sitting unseen yes saw coming up hill replied eustacia why must tell that be bold question considering reddlemans knowledge of past love undemonstrative manner have power to repress opinion of treated a remote from be glad to hear that can ask said reddleman bluntly now think of agrees with what saw last night be that eustacia wished to leave wished to know mr wildeve stayed at rainbarrow long time waiting for lady who didnt come waited too seems yes always do be glad to see disappointed will be there again tonight to be again disappointed truth be reddleman that lady so far from wishing to stand in way of thomasins marriage with mr wildeve must be very glad to promote venn felt much astonishment at avowal though did not show clearly that exhibition may greet remark be one remove from expectation be usually withheld in complicated case of two remove upwards indeed miss replied how do know that mr wildeve will come to rainbarrow again tonight asked heard say to that must he in regular temper eustacia looked for moment what felt murmured lifting deep dark eye anxiously to wish knew what to do dont want to be uncivil to dont wish to see again have few little thing to return to if choose to send em by miss note to tell that wish to say no more to ill take for quite privately must be most straightforward way of letting know mind very well said eustacia come towards house will bring out to went on a path be infinitely small parting in shaggy lock of heath reddleman followed exactly in trail saw from distance that captain be on bank sweeping horizon with telescope bidding venn to wait where stood entered house alone in ten minute returned with parcel note said in placing in hand why be so ready to take for can ask that suppose think to serve thomasin in way by be a anxious a ever to help on marriage venn be little moved must sooner have married myself said in low voice what feel be that if can not be happy without will do duty in helping to get a man ought eustacia looked curiously at singular man who spoke thus what strange sort of love to be entirely free from quality of selfishness be frequently chief constituent of passion sometimes only one reddlemans disinterestedness be so well deserving of respect that overshot respect by being barely comprehended almost thought absurd then be of one mind at last said yes replied venn gloomily if must tell miss why take such interest in must be easier be so sudden strange eustacia appeared at loss can not tell that reddleman said coldly venn said more pocketed letter bowing to eustacia went away rainbarrow have again become blended with night when wildeve ascended long acclivity at base on reaching top shape grew up from earth immediately behind be that of eustacias emissary slapped wildeve on shoulder feverish young inn keeper ex engineer started like satan at touch of ithuriels spear meeting be always at eight oclock at place said venn here arewe three three said wildeve looking quickly round yes be held up letter parcel wildeve took wonderingly dont quite see what mean said how do come here there must be mistake will be cleared from mind when have read letter lantern for one reddleman struck light kindled inch of tallow candle have brought sheltered with cap who be said wildeve discerning by candle light obscure rubicundity of person in companion be reddleman saw on hill morningwhy be man who please read letter if have come from other one shouldnt have be surprised murmured wildeve a opened letter read face grew serious to mr wildeve after thought have decided once for must hold further communication more consider matter more be convinced that there must be end to acquaintance have be uniformly faithful to throughout two year might now have ground for accusing of heartlessness if calmly consider what bore during period of desertion how passively put up with courtship of without once interfering will think own have right to consult own feeling when come back to again that be not what be towards may perhaps be fault in be one can scarcely reproach for when remember how left for thomasin little article gave in early part of friendship be returned by bearer of letter must rightly have be sent back when first heard of engagement to eustacia by time wildeve reached name blankness with have read first half of letter intensified to mortification be made great fool of one way said pettishly do know what be in letter reddleman hummed tune cant answer asked wildeve warmly ru um tum tum sang reddleman wildeve stood looking on ground beside venn foot till allowed eye to travel upwards over diggorys form a illuminated by candle to head face have have well suppose deserve considering how have played with said at last a much to a to venn of odd thing ever knew oddest be that must so run counter to own interest a to bring to interest certainly twas interest not to do anything must send courting thomasin again now have accepted youor something like mr yeobright say be to marry tisnt true then good lord heard of before didnt believe when did say so wildeve began humming a reddleman have done dont believe now cried venn ru um tum tum sang wildeve o lordhow can imitate said venn contemptuously ill have out ill go straight to diggory withdrew with emphatic step wildeves eye passing over form in withering derision a if be no more than heath cropper when reddlemans figure must no longer be seen wildeve descended plunged into rayless hollow of vale to lose two womenhe who have be well beloved of bothwas too ironical issue to be endured must only decently save by thomasin once became husband eustacias repentance thought must set in for long bitter term be wonder that wildeve ignorant of new man at back of scene must have supposed eustacia to be playing part to believe that letter be not result of momentary pique to infer that really gave up to thomasin must have required previous knowledge of transfiguration by man influence who be to know that have grown generous in greediness of new passion that in coveting one cousin be dealing liberally with in eagerness to appropriate gave way full of resolve to marry in haste wring heart of proud girl wildeve went way meanwhile diggory venn have returned to van where stood looking thoughtfully into stove new vista be opened up to however promising mr yeobrights view of might be a candidate for niece hand one condition be indispensable to favour of thomasin be renunciation of present wild mode of life in saw little difficulty must not afford to wait till next day before seeing thomasin detailing plan speedily plunged into toilet operation pulled suit of cloth clothes from box in about twenty minute stood before van lantern a reddleman in nothing face vermilion shade of be not to be removed in day closing door fastening with padlock venn set off towards bloom end have reached white paling laid hand upon gate when door of house opened quickly closed again female form have glided in at same time man who have seemingly be standing with woman in porch came forward from house till be face to face with venn be wildeve again man alive youve be quick at said diggory sarcastically slow a will find said wildeve lowering voice may a well go back again now ive claimed got good night reddleman thereupon wildeve walked away venn heart sank within though have not risen unduly high stood leaning over paling in indecisive mood for nearly quarter of hour then went up garden path knocked asked for mr yeobright instead of requesting to enter came to porch discourse be carried on between in low measured tone for space of ten minute more at end of time mr yeobright went in venn sadly retraced step into heath when have again regained van lit lantern with apathetic face at once began to pull off best clothes till in course of few minute reappeared a confirmed irretrievable reddleman that have seemed before viii firmness be discovered in gentle heart on evening interior of bloom end though cosy comfortable have be rather silent clym yeobright be not at home since christmas party have gone on few day visit to friend about ten mile off shadowy form seen by venn to part from wildeve in porch quickly withdraw into house be thomasins on entering threw down cloak have be carelessly wrapped round came forward to light where mr yeobright sat at work table drawn up within settle so part of projected into chimney corner dont like going out after dark alone tamsin said aunt quietly without looking up from work have only be just outside door well inquired mr yeobright struck by change in tone of thomasins voice observing thomasins cheek be flushed to pitch far beyond have reached

be one did not appear in landscape be man hour chosen for ceremony by thomasin wildeve have be so timed a to enable to escape awkwardness of meeting cousin clym who be returning same morning to own to partial truth of what have heard must be distressing a long a humiliating position resulting from event be unimproved be only after second successful journey to altar that must lift up head prove failure of first attempt pure accident have not be gone from bloom end more than hour when yeobright came by mead from other direction entered house have early breakfast said to mother after greeting

at least to take send money to at inn must be impolite since wildeve must pretty surely be present must discover transaction if a aunt suspected treated le kindly than deserved to be treated might

lived intensified reciprocal thought yet might have said that have disadvantage of consuming mutual affection at fearfully prodigal rate yeobright did not fear for own part recollection of eustacias old speech about evanescence of love now apparently forgotten by sometimes caused to ask question recoiled at thought that quality of finiteness be not foreign to eden when three four week have be passed thus yeobright resumed reading in earnest to make up for lost time studied indefatigably for wished to enter new profession with least possible delay now eustacias dream have always be once married to clym must have power of inducing to return to paris have carefully withheld promise to do so must be proof against coaxing argument have calculated to such degree on probability of success that have represented paris not budmouth to grandfather a in likelihood future home hope be bound up in dream in quiet day since marriage when yeobright have be poring over lip eye line of face have mused mused on subject even while in act of returning gaze now sight of book indicating future be antagonistic to dream struck with positively painful jar be hoping for time when a mistress of pretty establishment however small near parisian boulevard must be passing day on skirt at least of gay world catching stray waft from town pleasure be so well fitted to enjoy yet yeobright be a firm in contrary intention a if tendency of marriage be rather to develop fantasy of young philanthropy than to sweep away anxiety reached high pitch there be something in clyms undeviating manner made hesitate before sounding on subject at point in experience however incident helped occurred one evening about six week after union arose entirely out of unconscious misapplication of venn of fifty guinea intended for yeobright day two after receipt of money thomasin have sent note to aunt to thank have be surprised at largeness of amount a sum have ever be mentioned set down to late uncle generosity have be strictly charged by aunt to say nothing to husband of gift wildeve a be natural enough have not brought to mention to wife single particular of midnight scene in heath christian terror in like manner have tied tongue on share took in proceeding hoping that by mean other money have gone to proper destination simply asserted a much without giving detail therefore when week two have passed away mr yeobright began to wonder why never heard from son of receipt of present to add gloom to perplexity came possibility resentment might be cause of silence must hardly believe a much why did not write questioned christian confusion in answer must at once have led to believe that something be wrong have not one half of story be corroborated by thomasins note mr yeobright be in state of uncertainty when be informed one morning that son wife be visiting grandfather at mistover determined to walk up hill see eustacia ascertain from daughter in law lip whether family guinea be to mr yeobright what family jewel be to wealthier dowager have miscarried not when christian learnt where be going concern reached height at moment of departure must prevaricate no longer confessing to gambling told truth a far a knew itthat guinea have be won by wildeve what be going to keep mr yeobright cried hope trust not moaned christian he good man perhaps will do right thing said ought to have gied mr clyms share to eustacia thats perhaps what hell do to mr yeobright a soon a must calmly reflect there be much likelihood in for must hardly believe that wildeve must really appropriate money belonging to son intermediate course of giving to eustacia be sort of thing to please wildeves fancy filled mother with anger none le that wildeve must have got command of guinea after must rearrange disposal of placing clyms share in clyms wife hand because have be own sweetheart might be so still be a irritating pain a mr yeobright have ever borne instantly dismissed wretched christian from employ for conduct in affair feeling quite helpless unable to do without told afterwards that might stay little longer if chose then hastened off to eustacia moved by much le promising emotion towards daughter in law than have felt hour earlier when planning journey at time be to inquire in friendly spirit if there have be accidental loss now be to ask plainly if wildeve have privately given money have be intended a sacred gift to clym started at two oclock meeting with eustacia be hastened by appearance of young lady beside pool bank bordered grandfather premise where stood surveying scene perhaps thinking of romantic enactment have witnessed in past day when mr yeobright approached eustacia surveyed with calm stare of stranger mother in law be first to speak be coming to see said indeed said eustacia with surprise for mr yeobright much to girl mortification have refused to be present at wedding did not at expect be coming on business only said visitor more coldly than at first will excuse asking thishave received gift from thomasins husband gift mean money whati well meant privatelythough be not going to put in way money from mr wildeve nonever madam what do mean by eustacia fired up too quickly for own consciousness of old attachment between herself wildeve led to jump to conclusion that mr yeobright also knew of might have come to accuse of receiving dishonourable present from now simply ask question said mr yeobright have be ought to have better opinion of mei feared be against from first exclaimed eustacia be simply for clym replied mr yeobright with too much emphasis in earnestness be instinct of everyone to look after own how can imply that required guarding against cried eustacia passionate tear in eye have not injured by marrying what sin have done that must think so ill of have right to speak against to when have never wronged only did what be fair under circumstance said mr yeobright more softly must rather not have gone into question at present compel be not ashamed to tell honest truth be firmly convinced that ought not to marry youtherefore tried to dissuade by mean in power be done now have idea of complaining more be ready to welcome ah yes be very well to see thing in business point of view murmured eustacia with smothered fire of feeling why must think there be anything between mr wildeve have spirit a well a be indignant so must woman be be condescension in to be clyms wife not manuvre let remind therefore will not be treated a schemer whom becomes necessary to bear with because have crept into family oh said mr yeobright vainly endeavouring to control anger have never heard anything to show that son lineage be not a good a vyesperhaps better be amusing to hear talk of condescension be condescension nevertheless said eustacia vehemently if have known then what know now must be living in wild heath month after marriage ii must have thought twice before agreeing must be better not to say that might not sound truthful be not aware that deception be used on parti know there be notwhatever might have be case on other side be too exasperating answered younger woman huskily face crimsoning eye darting light how can dare to speak to like insist upon repeating to that have known that life must from marriage up to time have be a be must have said dont complain have never uttered sound of such thing to be true hope therefore in future will be silent on eagerness if injure now injure injure do think be evil disposed person injured before marriage have now suspected of secretly favouring man for money must not help what thought have never spoken of outside house spoke of within to clym must not do worse did duty ill do mine part of will possibly be to set against mother be always so why must not bear a others have borne before understand said eustacia breathless with emotion think capable of bad thing who can be worse than wife who encourages lover poison husband mind against relative yet be now character given to will not come drag out of hand mr yeobright gave back heat for heat dont rage at madam ill becomes beauty be not worth injury may do on account assure be only poor old woman who have lost son if have treated honourably must have have still eustacia said while scalding tear trickled from eye have brought to folly have caused division can never be healed have done nothing audacity from young woman be more than can bear be asked for have suspected have made speak of husband in way must not have done will let know have spoken thus will cause misery between

excited mother then withdrew eustacia panting stood looking into pool ii be set upon by adversity sings song result of unpropitious interview be that eustacia instead of passing afternoon with grandfather hastily returned home to clym where arrived three hour earlier than have be expected came indoors with face flushed eye still showing trace of recent excitement yeobright looked up astonished have never seen in way approaching to state before passed by must have gone upstairs unnoticed clym be so concerned that immediately followed what be matter eustacia said be standing on hearthrug in bedroom looking upon floor hand clasped in front of bonnet yet unremoved for moment did not answer then replied in low voice have seen mother will never see again weight fell like stone upon clym same morning when eustacia have arranged to go see grandfather clym have expressed wish that must drive down to bloom end inquire for mother in law adopt other mean might think fit to bring

dressed with scrupulous care to onlooker beauty must have made feeling almost seem reasonable gloomy corner into accident a much a indiscretion have brought woman might have led even moderate partisan to feel that have cogent reason for asking supreme power by what right being of such exquisite finish have be placed in circumstance calculated to make of charm curse rather than blessing be five in afternoon when came out from house ready for walk there be material enough in picture for twenty new conquest rebellious sadness be rather too apparent when sat indoors without bonnet be cloaked softened by outdoor attire always have sort of nebulousness about devoid of harsh edge anywhere so that face looked from environment a from cloud with noticeable line of demarcation between flesh clothes heat of day have scarcely declined a yet went along sunny hill at leisurely pace there being ample time for idle expedition tall fern buried in leafage whenever path lay through now formed miniature forest though not one stem of must remain to bud next year site chosen for village festivity be one of lawnlike oasis be occasionally yet not often met with on plateau of heath district brake of furze fern terminated abruptly round margin grass be unbroken green cattletrack skirted spot without however emerging from screen of fern path eustacia followed in order to reconnoitre group before joining lusty note of east egdon band have directed unerringly now beheld musician sitting in blue wagon with red wheel scrubbed a bright a new arched with stick to bough flower be tied in front of be grand central dance of fifteen twenty couple flanked by minor dance of inferior individual whose gyration be not always in strict keeping with tune young men wore blue white rosette with flush on face footed to girl who with excitement exercise blushed deeper than pink of numerous ribbon fair one with long curl fair one with short curl fair one with lovelocks fair one with braid flew round round beholder might well have wondered how such prepossessing set of young woman of like size age disposition must have be collected together where there be only one two village to choose from in background be one happy man dancing by with closed eye totally oblivious of rest fire be burning under pollard thorn few pace off over three kettle hung in row hard by be table where elderly dame prepared tea eustacia looked among in vain for cattle dealer wife who have suggested that must come have promised to obtain courteous welcome for unexpected absence of only local resident whom eustacia knew considerably damaged scheme for afternoon of reckless gaiety joining in became matter of difficulty notwithstanding be to advance cheerful dame must come forward with cup of tea make much of a stranger of superior grace knowledge to having watched company through figure of two dance decided to walk little further to cottage where might get refreshment then return homeward in shady time of evening did by time that retraced step towards scene of gipsying be necessary to repass on way to alderworth sun be going down air be now so still that must hear band afar off seemed to be playing with more spirit if be possible than when have come away on reaching hill sun have quite disappeared made little difference to eustacia to reveller for round yellow moon be rising before though ray have not yet outmastered from west dance be going on just same stranger have arrived formed ring around figure so that eustacia must stand among without chance of being recognized whole village full of sensuous emotion scattered abroad year long surged here in focus for hour forty heart of waving couple be beating a have not done since twelve month before have come together in similar jollity for time paganism be revived in heart pride of life be in adored none other than how many of impassioned temporary embrace be destined to become perpetual be possibly wonder of of who indulged in a well a of eustacia who looked on began to envy pirouetters to hunger for hope happiness fascination of dance seemed to engender within desperately fond of dancing one of eustacias expectation of paris have be opportunity might afford of indulgence in favourite pastime unhappily that expectation be now extinct within for ever whilst abstractedly watched spinning fluctuating in increasing moonlight suddenly heard name whispered by voice over shoulder turning in surprise beheld at elbow one whose presence instantly caused to flush to temple be wildeve till moment have not met eye since morning of marriage when have be loitering in church have startled by lifting veil coming forward to sign register a witness yet why sight of must have instigated that sudden rush of blood must not tell before must speak whispered do like dancing a much a ever think do replied in low voice will dance with must be great change for will not seem strange what strangeness can there be in relation dancing together ahyes relation perhaps none still if dont like to be seen pull down veil though there be not much risk of being known by light lot of stranger be here did a suggested act be tacit acknowledgment that accepted offer wildeve gave arm took down on outside of ring to bottom of dance entered in two minute more be involved in figure began working way upwards to top till have advanced halfway thither eustacia wished more than once that have not yielded to request from middle to top felt that since have come out to seek pleasure be only doing natural thing to obtain fairly launched into ceaseless glide whirl new position a top couple opened up to eustacias pulse began to move too quickly for long rumination of kind through length of five twenty couple threaded giddy way new vitality entered form pale ray of evening lent fascination to experience there be certain degree tone of light tends to disturb equilibrium of sens to promote dangerously tenderer mood added to movement drive emotion to rankness reason becoming sleepy unperceiving in inverse proportion light fell now upon two from disc of moon dancing girl felt symptom eustacia most of grass under foot became trodden away hard beaten surface of sod when viewed aslant towards moonlight shone like polished table air became quite still flag above wagon held musician clung to pole player appeared only in outline against sky except when circular mouth of trombone ophicleide french horn gleamed out like huge eye from shade of figure pretty dress of maid lost subtler day colour showed more le of misty white eustacia floated round round on wildeves arm face rapt statuesque soul have passed away from forgotten feature be left empty quiescent a always be when feeling go beyond register how near be to wildeve be terrible to think of must feel breathing of course must feel hers how badly have treated yet here be treading one measure enchantment of dance surprised clear line of difference divided like tangible fence experience within maze of motion from experience without beginning to dance have be like change of atmosphere outside have be steeped in arctic frigidity by comparison with tropical sensation here have entered dance from troubled hour of late life a one might enter brilliant chamber after night walk in wood wildeve by must have be merely agitation wildeve added to dance moonlight secrecy began to be delight whether personality supplied greater part of sweetly compounded feeling whether dance scene weighed more therein be nice point upon eustacia be entirely in cloud people began to say who be invidious inquiry be made have eustacia mingled with other girl in ordinary daily walk case must have be different here be not inconvenienced by excessive inspection for be wrought to brightest grace by occasion like planet mercury surrounded by lustre of sunset permanent brilliancy passed without much notice in temporary glory of situation a for wildeve feeling be easy to guess obstacle be ripening sun to love be at moment in delirium of exquisite misery to clasp a for five minute what be man through rest of year be kind of thing of men must appreciate have long since begun to sigh again for eustacia indeed may be asserted that signing marriage register with thomasin be natural signal to heart to return to first quarter that extra complication of eustacias marriage be one addition required to make return compulsory thus for different reason what be to rest exhilarating movement be to two riding upon whirlwind dance have come like irresistible attack upon sense of social order there be in mind to drive back into old path be now doubly irregular through three dance in succession spun way then fatigued with incessant motion eustacia turned to quit circle in have already remained too long wildeve led to grassy mound few yard distant where sat down partner standing beside from time that addressed at beginning of dance till now have not exchanged word dance walking have tired said tenderly not greatly be strange that must have met here of place after missing other so long have missed because tried to miss suppose yes began that proceedingby breaking promise be scarcely worth while to talk of now have formed other tie since thenyou no le than be sorry to hear that husband be ill be not illonly incapacitated yesthat be what mean sincerely sympathize with in trouble fate have treated cruelly be silent awhile have heard that have chosen to work a furze cutter said in low mournful voice have be mentioned to answered wildeve hesitatingly hardly believed be true what do think of a furze cutter wife think same a ever of eustacia nothing of sort can degrade ennoble occupation of husband wish must feel be there chance of mr yeobright getting better think so doubt be quite surprised to hear that have taken cottage thought in common with other people that must have taken off to home in paris immediately after have married what gay bright future have before thought will suppose return there with if sight get strong again observing that did not reply regarded more closely be almost weeping image of future never to be enjoyed revived sense of bitter disappointment picture of neighbour suspended ridicule be raised by wildeves word have be too much for proud eustacias equanimity wildeve must hardly control own too forward feeling when saw silent perturbation affected not to notice soon recovered calmness intend to walk home by asked o yes said eustacia what must hurt on heath who have nothing by diverging little can make way home same a yours will be glad to keep company a far a throope corner seeing that eustacia sat on in hesitation added perhaps think unwise to be seen in same road with after event of last summer indeed think such thing said haughtily will accept whose company choose for may be said by miserable inhabitant of egdon then let walk onif be ready nearest way be towards holly bush with dark shadow that see down there eustacia arose walked beside in direction signified brushing way over damping heath fern followed by strain of merrymaker who still kept up dance moon have now waxed bright silvery heath be proof against such illumination there be to be observed striking scene of dark rayless tract of country under atmosphere charged from zenith to extremity with whitest light to eye above two face must have appeared amid expanse like two pearl on table of ebony on account irregularity of path be not visible wildeve occasionally stumbled whilst eustacia found necessary to perform graceful feat of balancing whenever small tuft of heather root of furze protruded through grass of narrow track entangled foot at juncture in progress hand be invariably stretched forward to steady holding firmly until smooth ground be again reached when hand be again withdrawn to respectful distance performed journey for most part in silence drew near to throope corner few hundred yard from short path branched away to eustacias house by degree discerned coming towards pair of human figure apparently of male sex when came little nearer eustacia broke silence by saying one of men be husband promised to come to meet other be greatest enemy said wildeve look like diggory venn be man be awkward meeting said such be fortune know too much about unless must know more so prove to that what now know count for nothing well let beyou must deliver up to will think twice before direct to do here be man who have not forgotten item in meeting at rainbarrowhe be in company with husband of seeing together here will believe that meeting dancing at gipsy party be by chance very well whispered gloomily leave before come up wildeve bade tender farewell plunged across fern furze eustacia slowly walking on in two three minute met husband companion journey end here for tonight reddleman said yeobright a soon a perceived turn back with lady good night good night mr yeobright said venn hope to see better soon moonlight shone directly upon venn face a spoke revealed line to eustacia be looking suspiciously at venn keen eye have discerned what yeobrights feeble vision have nota man in act of withdrawing from eustacias sidewas within limit of probable if eustacia have be able to follow reddleman must soon have found striking confirmation of thought sooner have clym given arm led off scene than reddleman turned back from beaten track towards east egdon whither have be strolling merely to accompany clym in walk diggorys van being again in neighbourhood stretching out long leg crossed pathless portion of heath somewhat in direction wildeve have taken only man accustomed to nocturnal ramble must at hour have descended shaggy slope with venn velocity without falling headlong into pit snapping off leg by jamming foot into rabbit burrow venn went on without much inconvenience to course of scamper be towards quiet woman inn place reached in about hour be well aware that person who have be near throope corner when started must have got down here before lonely inn be not yet closed though scarcely individual be there business done being chiefly with traveller who passed inn on long journey have now gone on way venn went to public room called for mug of ale inquired of maid in indifferent tone if mr wildeve be at home thomasin sat in inner room heard venn voice when customer be present seldom showed owing to inherent dislike for business perceiving that one else be there tonight came out be not at home yet diggory said pleasantly expected sooner have be to east egdon to buy horse did wear light wideawake yes then saw at throope corner leading one home said venn drily beauty with white face mane a black a night will soon be here doubt rising looking for moment at pure sweet face of thomasin over shadow of sadness have passed since time when have last seen ventured to add mr wildeve seems to be often away at time o yes cried thomasin in what be intended to be tone of gaiety husband will play truant know wish must tell of secret plan must help to keep home at will in evening will consider if know of one replied venn in same light tone meant lightness then bowed in manner of own invention moved to go thomasin offered hand without sigh though with food for many reddleman went out when wildeve returned quarter of hour later thomasin said simply in abashed manner usual with now where be horse damon o have not bought after man asks too much somebody saw at throope corner leading homea beauty with white face mane a black a night ah said wildeve fixing eye upon who told that venn reddleman expression of wildeves face became curiously condensed be mistakeit must have be someone else said slowly testily for perceived that venn countermove have begun again iv rough coercion be employed word of thomasin seemed so little meant so much remained in ear of diggory venn help to keep home in evening on occasion venn have arrived on egdon heath only to cross to other sidehe have further connection with interest of yeobright family have business of own to attend to yet suddenly began to feel drifting into old track of manuvring on thomasins account sat in van considered from thomasins word manner have plainly gathered that wildeve neglected for whom must neglect if not for eustacia yet be scarcely credible that thing have come to head a to indicate eustacia systematically encouraged venn resolved to reconnoitre somewhat carefully lonely road led along vale from wildeves dwelling to clyms house at alderworth at time a have be seen wildeve be quite innocent of predetermined act of intrigue except at dance on green have not once met eustacia since marriage that spirit of intrigue be in have be shown by recent romantic habit of hisa habit of going out after dark strolling towards alderworth there looking at moon star looking at eustacias house walking back at leisure accordingly when watching on night after festival reddleman saw ascend by little path lean over front gate of clyms garden sigh turn to go back again be plain that wildeves intrigue be rather ideal than real venn retreated before down hill to place where path be merely deep groove between heather here mysteriously bent over ground for few minute retired when wildeve came on to spot ankle be caught by something fell headlong a soon a have recovered power of respiration sat up listened there be not sound in gloom beyond spiritless stir of summer wind feeling about for obstacle have flung down discovered that two tuft of heath have be tied together across path forming loop to traveller be certain overthrow wildeve pulled off string bound went on with tolerable quickness on reaching home found cord to be of reddish colour be just what have expected although weakness be not specially akin to physical fear specie of coup de jarnac from one knew too well troubled mind of wildeve movement be unaltered thereby night two later again went along vale to alderworth taking precaution of keeping out of path sense that be watched that craft be employed to circumvent errant taste added piquancy to journey so entirely sentimental so long a danger be of fearful sort imagined that venn mr yeobright be in league felt that there be certain legitimacy in combating coalition heath tonight appeared to be totally deserted wildeve after looking over eustacias garden gate for little time with cigar in mouth be tempted by fascination that emotional smuggling have for nature to advance towards window be not quite closed blind being only partly drawn down must see into room eustacia be sitting there alone wildeve contemplated for minute then retreating into heath beat fern lightly whereupon moth flew out alarmed securing one returned to window holding moth to chink opened hand moth made towards candle upon eustacias table hovered round two three time flew into flame eustacia started up have be well known signal in old time when wildeve have used to come secretly wooing to mistover at once knew that wildeve be outside before must consider what to do husband came in from upstairs eustacias face burnt crimson at unexpected collision of incident filled with animation that too frequently lacked have very high colour dearest said yeobright when came close enough to see appearance must be worse if be always so be warm said eustacia think will go into air for few minute will go with o be only going to gate arose before have time to get out of room loud rapping began upon front door ill goill go said eustacia in unusually quick tone for glanced eagerly towards window whence moth have flown nothing appeared there have better not at time of evening said clym stepped before into passage eustacia waited somnolent manner covering inner heat agitation listened clym opened door word be uttered outside presently closed came back saying nobody be there wonder what must have meant be left to wonder during rest of evening for explanation offered eustacia said nothing additional fact that knew of only adding more mystery to performance meanwhile little drama have be acted outside saved eustacia from possibility of compromising that evening at least whilst wildeve have be preparing moth signal person have come behind up to gate man who carried gun in hand looked on for moment at others operation by window walked up to house knocked at door then vanished round corner over hedge damn said wildeve have be watching again a signal have be rendered futile by uproarious rapping wildeve withdrew passed out at gate walked quickly down path without thinking of anything except getting away unnoticed halfway down hill path ran near knot of stunted holly in general darkness of scene stood a pupil in black eye when wildeve reached point report startled ear few spent gunshot fell among leaf around there be doubt that be cause of gun discharge rushed into clump of holly beating bush furiously with stick nobody be there attack be more serious matter than last be time before wildeve recovered equanimity new most unpleasant system of menace have begun intent appeared to be to do grievous bodily harm wildeve have looked upon venn first attempt a specie of horseplay reddleman have indulged in for want of knowing better now boundary line be passed divide annoying from perilous have wildeve known how thoroughly in earnest venn have become might have be still more alarmed reddleman have be almost exasperated by sight of wildeve outside clyms house be prepared to go to length short of absolutely shooting to terrify young innkeeper out of recalcitrant impulse doubtful legitimacy of such rough coercion did not disturb mind of venn trouble few such mind in such case sometimes be not to be regretted from impeachment of strafford to farmer lynchs short way with scamp of virginia there have be many triumph of justice be mockery of law about mile below clyms secluded dwelling lay hamlet where lived one of two constable who preserved peace in parish of alderworth wildeve went straight to constable cottage almost first thing that saw on opening door be constable truncheon hanging to nail a if to assure that here be mean to purpose on inquiry however of constable wife learnt that constable be not at home wildeve said must wait minute ticked on constable did not arrive wildeve cooled down from state of high indignation to restless dissatisfaction with scene constable wife whole set of circumstance arose left house altogether experience of evening have have cooling not to say chilling effect on misdirected tenderness wildeve be in mood to ramble again to alderworth after in hope of stray glance from eustacia thus far reddleman have be tolerably successful in rude contrivance for keeping down wildeves inclination to rove in evening have nipped in bud possible meeting between eustacia old lover very night have not anticipated that tendency of action must be to divert wildeves movement rather than to stop gambling with guinea have not conduced to make welcome guest to clym to call upon wife relative be natural be determined to see eustacia be necessary to choose le untoward hour than ten oclock at night since be unsafe to go in evening said ill go by day meanwhile venn have left heath gone to call upon mr yeobright with whom have be on friendly term since have learnt what providential countermove have made towards restitution of family guinea wondered at lateness of call have objection to see gave full account of clyms affliction of state in be living then referring to thomasin touched gently upon apparent sadness of day now maam depend upon said couldnt do better thing for of em than to make at home in house even if there must be little rebuff at first son disobeyed in marrying therefore have interest in household trouble be of own making mr yeobright tried to speak severely account of son state have moved her more than cared to show visit must make wildeve walk straighter than be inclined to do might prevent unhappiness down heath what do mean saw something tonight out there didnt like at wish son house mr wildeves be hundred mile apart instead of four five then there be understanding between clyms wife when made fool of thomasin well hope there understanding now hope will probably be very vain o clym o thomasin there harm done yet in fact ive persuaded wildeve to mind own business how o not by talkingby plan of mine called silent system hope youll succeed will if help by calling making friend with son youll have chance then of using eye well since have come to said mr yeobright sadly will own to reddleman that thought of going must be much happier if be reconciled marriage be unalterable life may be cut short must wish to die in peace be only son since son be made of such stuff be not sorry have other a for thomasin never expected much from have not disappointed forgave long ago forgive now ill go at very time of reddlemans

female tone clym doctor must be heard rushing forward from back part of shed to where mr yeobright lay oh what be whispered eustacia twas thomasin who spoke said wildeve then have fetched wonder if have better go inyet might do harm for long time there be utter silence among group within be broken at last by clym saying in agonized voice o doctor what doe mean doctor did not reply at once ultimately said be sinking fast heart be previously affected physical exhaustion have dealt finishing blow then there be weeping of woman then waiting then hushed exclamation then strange gasping sound then painful stillness be over said doctor further back in hut cotter whispered mr yeobright be dead almost at same moment two watcher observed form of small old fashioned child entering at open

intrude upon themi will go straight home damon good bye can not speak to more now parted company when eustacia have reached next hill looked back melancholy procession be wending way by light of lantern from hut towards bloom end wildeve be nowhere to be seen book fifththe discovery wherefore be light given to be in misery one evening about three week after funeral of mr yeobright when silver face of moon sent bundle of beam directly upon floor of clyms house at alderworth woman came forth from within reclined over garden gate a if to refresh awhile pale lunar touch make beauty of hag lent divinity to face already beautiful have not long be there when man came up road with hesitation said to how be tonight maam if please be better though still very unwell humphrey replied eustacia be light headed maam be quite sensible now do rave about mother just same poor fellow continued humphrey just a much though not quite so wildly said in low voice be very unfortunate maam that boy johnny must ever have told mother dying word about being broken hearted cast off by son twas enough to upset man alive eustacia made reply beyond of slight catch in breath a of one who fain must speak must not humphrey declining invitation to come in went away eustacia turned entered house ascended to front bedroom where shaded light be burning in bed lay clym pale haggard wide awake tossing to one side to other eye lit by hot light a if fire in pupil be burning up substance be eustacia said a sat down yes clym have be down to gate moon be shining beautifully there be not leaf stirring shining be whats moon to man like let shinelet anything be so that never see day eustacia dont know where to lookmy thought go through like sword o if man want to make immortal by painting picture of wretchedness let come here why do say so can not help feeling did best to kill clym yes be so be useless to excuse conduct to be too hideousi made advance must not bring to forgive now be dead if have only shown willing to make up with sooner have be friend then have died wouldnt be so hard to bear never went near house so never came near mine didnt know how welcome must have beenthats what trouble did not know be going to house that very night for be too insensible to understand if have only come to see longed that must be not to be there escaped from eustacia one of shivering sigh used to shake like pestilent blast have not yet told yeobright be too deeply absorbed in ramblings incidental to remorseful state to notice during illness have be continually talking thus despair have be added to original grief by unfortunate disclosure of boy who have received last word of mr yeobrightwords too bitterly uttered in hour of misapprehension then distress have overwhelmed longed for death a field labourer longs for shade be pitiful sight of man standing in very focus of sorrow continually bewailed tardy journey to mother house because be error must never be rectified insisted that must have be horribly perverted by fiend not to have thought before that be duty to go to since did not come to must ask eustacia to agree with in self condemnation when seared inwardly by secret dared not tell declared that must not give opinion must say thats because didnt know mother nature be always ready to forgive if asked to do so seemed to to be a obstinate child that made unyielding yet not unyieldingshe be proud reserved more yes can understand why held out against so long be waiting for dare say said hundred time in sorrow what return make for sacrifice have made for never went to when set out to visit be too late to think of be nearly intolerable sometimes condition have be one of utter remorse unsoftened by single tear of pure sorrow then writhed a lay fevered far more by thought than by physical ill if must only get one assurance that did not die in belief be resentful said one day when in mood must be better to think of than hope of heaven can not do give up too much to wearying despair said eustacia other men mother have died that doesnt make loss of mine yet be le loss than circumstance of loss sinned against on account there be light for sinned against think did not committed guilt may whole burden be upon head think might consider twice before say that eustacia replied single men have doubt right to curse a much a please men with wife involve two in doom pray down be in too sorry state to understand what be refining on said wretched man day night shout at have helped to kill in loathing may own be unjust to poor wife forgive for eustacia for scarcely know what do be always anxious to avoid sight of husband in such state a have become a dreadful to a trial scene be to juda iscariot brought before eye spectre of worn out woman knocking at door must not open shrank from contemplating yet be better for yeobright when spoke openly of sharp regret for in silence endured infinitely more must sometimes remain so long in tense brooding mood consuming by gnawing of thought that be imperatively necessary to make talk aloud grief might in degree expend in effort eustacia have not be long indoors after look at moonlight when soft footstep came up to house thomasin be announced by woman downstairs ah thomasin thank for coming tonight said clym when entered room here be see such wretched spectacle be that shrink from being seen by single friend

loneliness who must have be to stayed away like cur if there be justice in god let kill now have nearly blinded be not enough if must only strike with more pain must believe in forever hush hush o pray clym dont dont say implored thomasin affrighted into sob tear while eustacia at other side of room though pale face remained calm writhed in chair clym went on without heeding cousin be not worth receiving further proof even of heaven reprobation do think thomasin knew methat did not die in horrid mistaken notion about not forgiving cant tell how acquired if must only assure of do think so eustacia do speak to think can assure that knew better at last said thomasin pallid eustacia said nothing why didnt come to house must have taken in showed how loved in spite of never came didnt go to died on heath like animal kicked out nobody to help till be too late if must have seen thomasin a saw hera poor dying woman lying in dark upon bare ground moaning nobody near believing be utterly deserted by world must have moved to anguish must have moved brute poor woman mother wonder said to child have seen broken hearted woman what state must have be brought to to say that who can have done be too dreadful to think of wish must be punished more heavily than be how long be what called out of sens week think then became calm yes for four day now have left off being calm try to be

have always be open to hera welcome here have always awaited that never came to see have better not talk more now clym said eustacia faintly from other part of room for scene be growing intolerable to let talk to instead for little time will be here thomasin said soothingly consider what one sided way have of looking at matter clym when said that to little boy have not found taken into arm might have be uttered in moment of bitterness be rather like aunt to say thing in haste sometimes used to speak so to though did not come be convinced that thought of coming to see do suppose man mother must live two three month without one forgiving thought forgave why must not have forgiven laboured to win round did nothing who be going to teach people higher secret of happiness did not know how to keep out of gross misery most untaught be wise enough to avoid how did get here tonight thomasin said eustacia damon set down at end of lane have driven into east egdon on business will come pick up

sense of made o purpose for maam thank said hastily wish to put out now will soon burn down said charley rather disappointed be not pity to knock out dont know musingly answered stood in silence broken only by crackling of flame till charley perceiving that did not want to talk to moved reluctantly away eustacia remained within bank looking at fire intending to go indoors yet lingering still

must ask whether have given quite time enoughif have not come little too suddenly upon on sombre morning now that first flush of anger have paled be disinclined to ascribe to more than indiscreet friendship with wildeve for there have not appeared in manner sign of dishonour once admitted absolutely dark interpretation of act towards mother be no longer forced upon on evening of fifth november thought of eustacia be intense echo from past time when have exchanged tender word day long came like diffused murmur of seashore left mile behind surely said might have brought to communicate with before now confess honestly what wildeve be to instead of remaining at home night determined to go see thomasin husband if found opportunity must allude to cause of separation between eustacia keeping

be angry observed that eye be brimming with tear well said there be nothing new in of course dont mean to be rough towards so need not cry now dont let speak of subject more more be said thomasin being glad enough of reason for not mentioning clyms visit to that evening story vii night of sixth of november having resolved on flight eustacia at time seemed anxious that something must happen to thwart own intention only event must really change position be appearance of clym glory have encircled a lover be departed now yet good simple quality of must occasionally return to memory stir momentary throb of hope that must again present before calmly considered be not likely that severance a now existed must ever close upshe must have to live on a painful object isolated out of place

inside cottage have seen recognized in momentary irradiation be susan occupied in preparing posset for little boy who often ailing be now seriously unwell susan dropped spoon shook fist at vanished figure then proceeded with work in musing absent way at eight oclock hour at eustacia have promised to signal wildeve if ever signalled at looked around premise to learn if coast be clear went to furze rick pulled thence long stemmed bough of fuel carried to corner of bank glancing behind to see if shutter be closed struck light kindled furze when be thoroughly ablaze eustacia took by stem waved in air above head till have burned out be gratified if gratification be possible to mood by seeing similar light in vicinity of wildeves residence minute two later having agreed to keep watch at hour night in case must require assistance promptness proved how strictly have held to word four hour after present time be at midnight be to be ready to drive to budmouth a prearranged eustacia returned to house supper having be got over retired early sat in bedroom waiting for time to go by night being dark threatening captain vye have not strolled out to gossip in cottage to call at inn a

baby upstairs to clyms bed then came down to sitting room again where made larger fire began drying fire soon flared up chimney giving room appearance of comfort be doubled by contrast with drumming of storm without snapped at windowpane breathed into chimney strange low utterance seemed to be prologue to tragedy least part of thomasin be in house for heart being at ease about little girl upstairs be mentally following clym on journey having indulged in imaginary peregrination for considerable interval became impressed with sense of intolerable slowness of time sat on moment then came when must scarcely sit longer be like satire on patience to remember that clym must hardly have reached inn a yet at last went to baby bedside child be sleeping soundly imagination of possibly disastrous event at home predominance within of unseen over seen agitated beyond endurance must not refrain from going down opening door rain still continued candlelight falling upon nearest drop making glistening dart of a descended across throng of invisible one behind to plunge into medium be to plunge into water slightly diluted with air difficulty of returning to house at moment made more desirous of doing soanything be better than suspense have come here well enough said why shouldnt go back again be mistake for to be away hastily fetched infant wrapped up cloaked a before shoveling ash over fire to prevent accident went into open air pausing first to put door key in old place behind shutter resolutely turned face to confronting pile of firmamental darkness beyond paling stepped into midst thomasins imagination being so actively engaged elsewhere night weather have for terror beyond of actual discomfort difficulty be soon ascending bloom end valley traversing undulation on side of hill noise of wind over heath be shrill a if whistled for joy at finding night so congenial a sometimes path led to hollow between thicket of tall dripping bracken dead though not yet prostrate enclosed like pool when be more than usually tall lifted baby to top of head that might be out of reach of drenching frond on higher ground where wind be brisk sustained rain flew in level flight without sensible descent so that be beyond power to imagine remoteness of point at left bosom of cloud here self defence be impossible individual drop stuck into like arrow into saint sebastian be enabled to avoid puddle by nebulous paleness signified presence though beside anything le dark than heath must have appeared a blackness yet in spite of thomasin be not sorry that have started to

reasonable at time be in view windy wet place in person might experience much discomfort lose path without care possibly catch cold if path be well known difficulty at such time of keeping therein be not altogether great from familiar feel to foot once lost be irrecoverable owing to baby who somewhat impeded thomasins view forward distracted mind did at last lose track mishap occurred when be descending open slope about two third home instead of attempting by wandering hither thither hopeless task of finding such mere thread went straight on trusting for guidance to general knowledge of contour be scarcely surpassed by clyms by of heath cropper at length thomasin reached hollow began to discern through rain faint blotted radiance presently assumed oblong form of open door knew that house stood hereabouts be soon aware of nature of door by height above ground why be diggory venn van surely said certain secluded spot near rainbarrow be knew often venn chosen centre when staying in neighbourhood guessed at once that have stumbled upon mysterious retreat question arose in mind whether not must ask to guide into path in anxiety to reach home decided that must appeal to notwithstanding strangeness of appearing before eye at place season when in pursuance of resolve thomasin reached van looked in found to be untenanted though there be doubt that be reddlemans fire be burning in stove lantern hung from nail round doorway floor be merely sprinkled with rain not saturated told that door have not long be opened while stood uncertainly looking in thomasin heard footstep advancing from darkness behind turning beheld well known form in corduroy lurid from head to foot lantern beam falling upon through intervening gauze of raindrop thought went down slope said without noticing face how do come back here again diggory said thomasin faintly who be said venn still unperceiving why be cry so just now o diggory dont know said of course dont wrapped up like what do mean have not be cry here have not be here before venn then came nearer till must see illuminated side of form mr wildeve exclaimed starting what time for to meet baby too what dreadful thing can have brought out on night a must not immediately answer without asking permission hopped into van took by arm drew up after what be continued when stood within have lost way coming from bloom end be in great hurry to get home please show a quickly a can be so silly of not to know egdon better can not think how came to lose path show quickly diggory please yes of course will go with ee came to before mr wildeve only came minute thats strange be lying down here asleep about five minute ago with door shut to keep out weather when brushing of woman clothes over heath bush just outside woke up for dont sleep heavy at same time heard sobbing cry from same woman opened door held out lantern just a far a light must reach saw woman turned head when light sheened on then hurried on downhill hung up lantern be curious enough to pull on thing dog few step must see nothing of more be where have be when came up when saw thought be same one perhaps be one of heathfolk going home couldnt be ti too late noise of gown over heth be of whistling sort that nothing silk will make wasnt then dress be not silk see be anywhere in line between mistover inn well yes not far out ah wonder if be diggory must go at once jumped down from van before be aware when venn unhooked lantern leaped down after ill take baby maam said must be tired out by weight thomasin hesitated moment then delivered baby into venn hand dont squeeze diggory said hurt little arm keep cloak close over like so that rain may not drop in face will said venn earnestly a if must hurt anything belonging to only meant accidentally said thomasin baby be dry enough be pretty wet said reddleman when in closing door of cart to padlock noticed on floor ring of water drop where cloak have hung from thomasin followed a wound right left to avoid larger bush stopping occasionally covering lantern while looked over shoulder to gain idea of position of rainbarrow above be necessary to keep directly behind back to preserve proper course be sure rain doe not fall upon baby quite sure may ask how old be said thomasin reproachfully anybody can see better than in moment be nearly two month old how far be now to inn little over quarter of mile will walk little faster be afraid must not keep up be very anxious to get there ah there be light from window ti not from window thats gig lamp to best of belief o said thomasin in despair wish have be there soonergive baby diggoryyou can go back now must go way said venn there be quag between light will walk into up to neck unless take round light be at inn there be quag in front of light be below inn two three hundred yard never mind said thomasin hurriedly go towards light not towards inn yes answered venn swerving round in obedience after pause wish must tell what great trouble be think have proved that can be trusted there be thing can not becannot be told to then heart rose into throat must say no more ix sight sound draw wanderer together having seen eustacias signal from hill at eight oclock wildeve immediately prepared to assist in flight a hoped accompany be somewhat perturbed manner of informing thomasin that be going on journey be in sufficient to rouse suspicion when have gone to bed collected few article must require went upstairs to money chest whence took tolerably bountiful sum in note have be advanced to on property be so soon to have in possession to defray expense incidental to removal then went to stable coach house to assure that horse gig harness be in fit condition for long drive nearly hour be spent thus on returning to house wildeve have thought of thomasin being anywhere in bed have told stable lad not to stay up leading boy to understand that departure must be at three four in morning for though exceptional hour be le strange than midnight time actually agreed on packet from budmouth sailing between one two at last be quiet have nothing to do to wait by effort must shake off oppression of spirit have experienced ever since last meeting with eustacia hoped there be that in situation money must cure have persuaded that to act not ungenerously towards gentle wife by settling on half of property with chivalrous devotion towards greater woman by sharing fate be possible though meant to adhere to eustacias instruction to letter to deposit where wished to leave must that be will spell that have cast over intensified heart be beating fast in anticipated futility of such command in face of mutual wish that must throw in lot together must not allow to dwell long upon conjecture maxim hope at twenty minute to twelve again went softly to stable harnessed horse lit lamp whence taking horse by head led with covered car out of yard to spot by roadside quarter of mile below inn here wildeve waited slightly sheltered from driving rain by high bank have be cast up at place along surface of road where lit by lamp loosened gravel small stone scudded clicked together before wind leaving in heap plunged into heath boomed across bush into darkness only one sound rose above din of weather be roaring of ten hatch weir to southward from river in mead formed boundary of heath in direction lingered on in perfect stillness till began to fancy that midnight hour must have struck very strong doubt have arisen in mind if eustacia must venture down hill in such weather yet knowing nature felt that might poor thing ti like ill luck murmured at length turned to lamp looked at watch to surprise be nearly quarter past midnight now wished that have driven up circuitous road to mistover plan not adopted because of enormous length of route in proportion to of pedestrian path down open hillside consequent increase of labour for horse at moment footstep approached light of lamp being in different direction comer be not visible step paused then came on again eustacia said wildeve person came forward light fell upon form of clym glistening with wet whom wildeve immediately recognized wildeve who stood behind lamp be not at once recognized by yeobright stopped a if in doubt whether waiting vehicle must have anything to do with flight of wife not sight of yeobright at once banished wildeves sober feeling who saw again a deadly rival from whom eustacia be to be kept at hazard hence wildeve did not speak in hope that clym must pas by without particular inquiry while hung thus in hesitation dull sound became audible above storm wind origin be unmistakableit be fall of body into stream in adjoining mead apparently at point near weir started good god can be said clym why must be said wildeve in alarm forgetting that have hitherto screened ahthats traitor be cried yeobright why must be because last week must have put end to life if have be able ought to have be watched take one of lamp come with yeobright seized one on side hastened on wildeve did not wait to unfasten other followed at once along meadow track to weir little in rear of clym shadwater weir have at foot large circular pool fifty foot in diameter into water flowed through ten huge hatch raised lowered by winch cog in ordinary manner side of pool be of masonry to prevent water from washing away bank force of stream in winter be sometimes such a to undermine retaining wall precipitate into hole clym reached hatch framework of be shaken to foundation by velocity of current nothing froth of wave must be discerned in pool below got upon plank bridge over race holding to rail that wind might not blow off crossed to other side of river there leant over wall lowered lamp only to behold vortex formed at curl of returning current wildeve meanwhile have arrived on former side light from yeobrights lamp shed flecked agitated radiance across weir pool revealing to ex engineer tumbling course of current from hatch above across gashed puckered mirror dark body be slowly borne by one of backward current o darling exclaimed wildeve in agonized voice without showing sufficient presence of mind even to throw off greatcoat leaped into boiling caldron yeobright must now also discern floating body though indistinctly imagining from wildeves plunge that there be life to be saved be about to leap after bethinking of wiser plan placed lamp against post to make stand upright running round to lower part of pool where there be wall sprang in boldly waded upwards towards deeper portion here be taken off leg in swimming be carried round into centre of basin where perceived wildeve struggling while hasty action be in progress here venn thomasin have be toiling through lower corner of heath in direction of light have not be near enough to river to hear plunge saw removal of carriage lamp watched motion into mead a soon a reached car horse venn guessed that something new be amiss hastened to follow in course of moving light venn walked faster than thomasin came to weir alone lamp placed against post by clym still shone across water reddleman observed something floating motionless being encumbered with infant ran back to meet thomasin take baby please mr wildeve said hastily run home with call stable lad make send down to men who may be living near somebody have fallen into weir thomasin took child ran when came to covered car horse though fresh from stable be standing perfectly still a if conscious of misfortune saw for first time whose be nearly fainted must have be unable to proceed step that necessity of preserving little girl from harm nerved to amazing self control in agony of suspense entered house put baby in place of safety woke lad female domestic ran out to give alarm at nearest cottage diggory having returned to brink of pool observed that small upper hatch float be withdrawn found one of lying upon grass taking under one arm with lantern in hand entered at bottom of pool a clym have done a soon a began to be in deep water flung across hatch thus supported be able to keep afloat a long a chose holding lantern aloft with disengaged hand propelled by foot steered round round pool ascending time by one of back stream descending in middle of current at first must see nothing then amidst glistening of whirlpool white clot of foam distinguished woman bonnet floating alone search be now under left wall when something came to surface almost close beside be not a have expected woman man reddleman put ring of lantern between teeth seized floating man by collar holding on to hatch with remaining arm struck out into strongest race by unconscious man hatch be carried down stream a soon a venn found foot dragging over pebble of willower part below secured footing waded towards brink there where water stood at about height of waist flung away hatch attempted to drag man be matter of great difficulty found a reason that leg of unfortunate stranger be tightly embraced by arm of man who have hitherto be entirely beneath surface at moment heart bounded to hear footstep running towards two men roused by thomasin appeared at brink above ran to where venn be helped in lifting out apparently drowned person separating laying out upon grass venn turned light upon face one who have be uppermost be yeobright who have be completely submerged be wildeve now must search hole again said venn woman be in there somewhere get pole one of men went to footbridge tore off handrail reddleman two others then entered water together from below a before with united force probed pool forward to where sloped down to central depth venn be not mistaken in supposing that person who have sunk for last time must be washed down to point for when have examined to about halfway across something impeded thrust pull forward said venn raked in with pole till be close to foot venn vanished under stream came up with armful of wet drapery enclosing woman cold form be remained of desperate eustacia when reached bank there stood thomasin in stress of grief bending over two unconscious one who already lay there horse cart be brought to nearest point in road be work of few minute only to place three in vehicle venn led on horse supporting thomasin upon arm two men followed till reached inn woman who have be shaken out of sleep by thomasin have hastily dressed lighted fire other servant being left to snore on in peace at back of house insensible form of eustacia clym wildeve be then brought in laid on carpet with foot to fire when such restorative process a must be thought of be adopted at once stableman being in meantime sent for doctor there seemed to be not whiff of life in of body then thomasin whose stupor of grief have be thrust off awhile by frantic action applied bottle of hartshorn to clyms nostril having tried in vain upon other two sighed clyms alive exclaimed soon breathed distinctly again again did attempt to revive husband by same mean wildeve gave sign there be too much reason to think that eustacia be for ever beyond reach of stimulating perfume exertion did not relax till doctor arrived when one by one senseless three be taken upstairs put into warm bed venn soon felt relieved from further attendance went to door scarcely able yet to realize strange catastrophe have befallen family in took so great interest thomasin surely must be broken down by sudden overwhelming nature of event firm sensible mr yeobright lived now to support gentle girl through ordeal unimpassioned spectator might think of loss of such husband a wildeve there must be doubt that for moment be distracted horrified by blow a for not being privileged to go to comfort saw reason for waiting longer in house where remained only a stranger returned across heath to van fire be not yet out everything remained a have left venn now bethought of clothes be saturated with water to weight of lead changed spread before fire lay down to sleep be more than must do to rest here while excited by vivid imagination of turmoil be in at house have quitted blaming for coming away dressed in suit locked up door again hastened across to inn rain be still falling heavily when entered kitchen bright fire be shining from hearth two woman be bustling about one of whom be olly dowden well how be going on now said venn in whisper mr yeobright be better mr yeobright mr wildeve be dead cold doctor say be quite gone before be out of water ah thought a much when hauled em up mr wildeve be a well a can be expected doctor

while thought of who be upstairs two be corps one have barely escaped jaw of death be sick widow last occasion on have lingered by fireplace be when raffle be in progress when wildeve be alive well thomasin active smiling in next room yeobright eustacia just made husband wife mr yeobright living at bloom end have seemed at time that then position of affair be good for at least twenty year to come yet of circle be only one whose situation have not materially changed while ruminated footstep descended stair be nurse who brought in hand rolled mass of wet paper woman be so engrossed with occupation that hardly saw venn took from cupboard piece of twine strained across fireplace tying end of piece to firedog previously pulled forward for purpose unrolling wet paper began pinning one by one to string in manner of clothes on line what be said venn poor master banknote answered be found in pocket when undressed then be not coming back again for time said venn that will never know said venn be loth to depart for on earth interested lay under roof a nobody in house have more sleep that night except two who slept for ever there be reason why must not remain so retired into niche of fireplace where have used to sit there continued watching steam from double row of banknote a waved backwards forward in draught of chimney till flaccidity be changed to dry crispness throughout then woman came unpinned folding together carried handful upstairs presently doctor appeared from above with look of man who must do more pulling on glove went out of house trotting of horse soon dying away upon road at four oclock there be gentle knock at door be from charley who have be sent by captain vye to inquire if anything have be heard of eustacia girl who admitted looked in face a if did not know what answer to return showed in to where venn be seated saying to reddleman will tell please venn told charleys only utterance be feeble indistinct sound stood quite still then burst out spasmodically will see once more dare say may see said diggory gravely hadnt better run tell captain vye yes yes only do hope will see just once again will said low voice behind starting round beheld by dim light thin pallid almost spectral form wrapped in blanket looking like lazarus coming from tomb be yeobright venn charley spoke clym continued will see there will be time enough to tell captain when get daylight must like to see toowould not diggory look very beautiful now venn assented by rising to foot with charley followed clym to foot of staircase where took off boot charley did same followed yeobright upstairs to landing where there be candle burning yeobright took in hand with led way into adjoining room here went to bedside folded back sheet stood silently looking upon eustacia who a lay there still in death eclipsed living phase pallor did not include quality of complexion seemed more than whiteness be almost light expression of finely carved mouth be pleasant a if sense of dignity have just compelled to leave off speaking eternal rigidity have seized upon in momentary transition between fervour resignation black hair be looser now than of have ever seen before surrounded brow like forest stateliness of look have be almost too marked for dweller in country domicile have at last found artistically happy background nobody spoke till at length clym covered turned aside now come here said went to recess in same room there on smaller bed lay figurewildeve le repose be visible in face than in eustacias same luminous youthfulness overspread least sympathetic observer must have felt at sight of now that be born for higher destiny than only sign upon of recent struggle for life be in fingertip be worn sacrificed in dying endeavour to obtain hold on face of weir wall yeobrights manner have be so quiet have uttered so few syllable since reappearance that venn imagined resigned be only when have left room stood upon landing that true state of mind be apparent here said with wild smile inclining head towards chamber in eustacia lay be second woman have killed year be great cause of mother death be chief cause of hers how said venn spoke cruel word to left house did not invite back till be too late be who ought to have drowned must have be charity to living have river overwhelmed borne up can not die who ought to have lived lie dead

going crazy round stick under very nose will have objection at venn soon after went away in evening yeobright strolled a far a fairway cottage be lovely may sunset birch tree grew on margin of vast egdon wilderness have put on new leaf delicate a butterfly wing diaphanous a amber beside fairway dwelling be open space recessed from road here be now collected young people from within radius of couple of mile pole lay with one end supported on trestle woman be engaged in wreathing from top downwards with wild flower instinct of merry england lingered on here with exceptional vitality symbolic custom tradition have attached to season of year be yet reality on egdon indeed impulse of such outlandish hamlet be pagan stillin spot homage to nature self adoration frantic gaiety fragment of teutonic rite to divinity whose name be forgotten seem in way other to have survived medival doctrine yeobright did not interrupt preparation went home again next morning when thomasin withdrew curtain of bedroom window there stood maypole in middle of green top cutting into sky have sprung up in night rather early morning like jack bean stalk opened casement to get better view of garland posy adorned sweet perfume of flower have already spread into surrounding air being free from taint conducted to lip full measure of fragrance received from spire of blossom in midst at top of pole be crossed hoop decked with small flower beneath came milk white zone of maybloom then zone of bluebell then of cowslip then of lilac then of ragged robin daffodil so on till lowest stage be reached thomasin noticed be delighted that may revel be to be so near when afternoon came people began to gather on green yeobright be interested enough to look out upon from open window of room soon after thomasin walked out from door immediately below turned eye up to cousin face be dressed more gaily than yeobright have ever seen dressed since time of wildeves death eighteen month before since day of marriage even have not exhibited to such advantage how pretty look today thomasin said be because of maypole not altogether then blushed dropped eye did not specially observe though manner seemed to to be rather peculiar considering that be only addressing must be possible that have put on summer clothes to please recalled conduct towards throughout last few week when have often be working together in garden just a have formerly done when be boy girl under mother eye what if interest in be not so entirely that of relative a have formerly be to yeobright possibility of sort be serious matter almost felt troubled at thought of pulse of loverlike feeling have not be stilled during eustacias lifetime have gone into grave with passion for have occurred too far on in manhood to leave fuel enough on hand for fire of sort a may happen with more boyish love even supposing capable of loving again that love must be plant of slow laboured growth in end only small sickly like autumn hatched bird be so distressed by new complexity when enthusiastic brass band arrived struck up did about five oclock with apparently wind enough among member to blow down house withdrew from room by back door went down garden through gate in hedge away out of sight must not bear to remain in presence of enjoyment today though have tried hard nothing be seen of for four hour when came back by same path be dusk dew be coating green thing boisterous music have ceased entering premise a did from behind must not see if may party have gone till have passed through thomasins division of house to front door thomasin be standing within porch alone looked at reproachfully went away just when began clym said yes felt must not join in went out with of course did not appeared to be dressed on purpose yes must not go out alone so many people be there one be there now yeobright strained eye across dark green patch beyond paling near black form of maypole discerned shadowy figure sauntering idly up down who be said mr venn said thomasin might have asked to come in think tamsie have be very kind to first last will now said acting on impulse went through wicket to where venn stood under maypole be mr venn think inquired venn started a if have not seen herartful man that wasand said yes will come in be afraid have seen dancing evening have very best of girl for partner be that wont come in because wish to stand here think over past hour of enjoyment well thats partly said mr venn with ostentatious sentiment main reason why be biding here like be want to wait till moon rise to see how pretty maypole look in moonlight to look for glove be dropped by one of maiden thomasin be speechless with surprise that man who have to walk four five mile to home must wait here for such reason pointed to only one conclusionthe man must be amazingly interested in glove owner be dancing with diggory asked in voice revealed that have made considerably more interesting to by disclosure no sighed will not come in then not tonight thank maam will lend lantern to look for young person glove mr venn o be not necessary mr wildeve thank moon will rise in few minute thomasin went back to porch be coming in said clym who have be waiting where have left must rather not tonight said then passed by into house whereupon clym too retired to own room when clym be gone thomasin crept upstairs in dark just listening by cot to assure that child be asleep went to window gently lifted corner of white curtain looked out venn be still there watched growth of faint radiance appearing in sky by eastern hill till presently edge of moon burst upwards flooded valley with light diggorys form be now distinct on green be moving about in bowed attitude evidently scanning grass for precious missing article walking in zigzag right left till must have passed over foot of ground how very ridiculous thomasin murmured to herself in tone be intended to be satirical to think that man must be so silly a to go mooning about like for girl glove respectable dairyman too man of money a be now what pity at last venn appeared to find whereupon stood up raised to lip then placing in breastpocketthe nearest receptacle to man heart permitted by modern raimenthe ascended valley in mathematically direct line towards distant home in meadow ii thomasin walk in green place by roman road clym saw little of thomasin for several day after when met be more silent than usual at length asked what be thinking of so intently be thoroughly perplexed said candidly can not for life think who be that diggory venn be so much in love with none of girl at maypole be good enough for yet must have be there clym tried to imagine venn choice for moment ceasing to be interested in question went on again with gardening clearing up of mystery be granted for time one afternoon thomasin be upstairs getting ready for walk when have occasion to come to landing call rachel rachel be girl about thirteen who carried baby out for airing came upstairs at call have seen one of last new glove about house rachel inquired thomasin be fellow to one rachel did not reply why dont answer said mistress think be lost maam lost who lost have never worn once rachel appeared a one dreadfully troubled at last began to cry please maam on day of maypole have none to wear seed yours on table thought must borrow em did not mean to hurt em at one of got lost somebody gave money to buy pair for have not be able to go anywhere to get em who somebody mr venn did know be glove yes told thomasin be so surprised by explanation that quite forgot to lecture girl who glided silently away thomasin did not move further than to turn eye upon grass plat where maypole have stood remained thinking then said to herself that must not go out afternoon must work hard at baby unfinished lovely plaid frock cut on cross in newest fashion how managed to work hard yet do more than have done at end of two hour must have be mystery to anyone not aware that recent incident be of kind likely to divert industry from manual to mental channel next day went way a usual continued custom of walking in heath with other companion than little eustacia now of age when be matter of doubt with such character whether be intended to walk through world on hand on foot so that get into painful complication by trying be very pleasant to thomasin when have carried child to lonely place to give little private practice on green turf shepherd thyme formed soft mat to fall headlong upon when equilibrium be lost once when engaged in system of training stooping to remove bit of stick fern stalk other such fragment from child path that journey might not be brought to untimely end by insuperable barrier quarter of inch high be alarmed by discovering that man on horseback be almost close beside soft natural carpet having muffled horse tread rider who be venn waved hat in air bowed gallantly diggory give glove said thomasin whose manner be under circumstance to plunge into midst of subject engrossed venn immediately dismounted put hand in breastpocket handed glove thank be very good of to take care of be very good of to say so o be quite glad to find have everybody get so indifferent that be surprised to know thought of if have remembered what be once wouldnt have be surprised ah said quickly men of character be mostly so independent what be character asked dont exactly know said thomasin simply except be to cover up feeling under practical manner only to show when be alone ah how do know said venn strategically because said stopping to put little girl who have managed to get upside down right end up again because do mustnt judge by folk in general said venn still dont know much what feeling be nowadays have got so mixed up with business of one sort tother that soft sentiment be gone off in vapour like yes be given up body soul to making of money money be dream o diggory how wicked said thomasin reproachfully looking at in exact balance between taking word seriously judging a said to tease yes ti rather rum course said venn in bland tone of one comfortably resigned to sin must no longer overcome who used to be so nice well thats argument rather like because what man have once be may be again thomasin blushed except that be rather harder now venn continued why asked because be richer than be at time o nonot much have made nearly over to baby a be duty to do except just enough to live on be rather glad of said venn softly regarding from corner of eye for make easier for to be friendly thomasin blushed again when few more word have be said of not unpleasing kind venn mounted horse rode on conversation have passed in hollow of heath near old roman road place much frequented by thomasin might have be observed that did not in future walk way le often from having met venn there now whether not venn abstained from riding thither because have met thomasin in same place might easily have be guessed from proceeding about two month later in same year iii serious discourse of clym with cousin throughout period yeobright have more le pondered on duty to cousin thomasin must not help feeling that must be pitiful waste of sweet material if tender natured thing must be doomed from early stage of life onwards to dribble away winsome quality on lonely gorse fern felt a economist merely not a lover passion for eustacia have be sort of conserve of whole life have nothing more of supreme quality left to bestow so far obvious thing be not to entertain idea of marriage with thomasin even to oblige be not year ago there have be in mother mind great fancy about thomasin have not positively amounted to desire have always be favourite dream that must be man wife in good time if happiness of be endangered thereby be fancy in question so what course save one be there now left for son who reverenced mother memory a yeobright did be unfortunate fact that particular whim of parent might have be dispersed by hour conversation during life becomes sublimated by death into fiat most absolute with such result to conscientious child a parent have lived must have be first to decry have only yeobrights own future be involved must have proposed to thomasin with ready heart have nothing to lose by carrying out dead mother hope dreaded to contemplate thomasin wedded to mere corpse of lover that now felt to be have three activity alive in one be almost daily walk to little graveyard wherein mother lay just a frequent visit by night to more distant enclosure numbered eustacia among dead third be self preparation for vocation alone seemed likely to satisfy cravingsthat of itinerant preacher of eleventh commandment be difficult to believe that thomasin must be cheered by husband with such tendency a yet resolved to ask let decide for herself be even with pleasant sense of doing duty that went downstairs to one evening for purpose when sun be printing on valley same long shadow of housetop that have seen lying there time out of number while mother lived thomasin be not in room found in front garden have long be wanting thomasin began to say something about matter concern future be going to say now remarked quickly colouring a met gaze do stop minute clym let speak first for oddly enough have be wanting to say something to by mean say on tamsie suppose nobody can overhear went on casting eye around lowering voice well first will promise thisthat wont be angry call anything harsh if disagree with what propose yeobright promised continued what want be advice for be relationi mean sort of guardian to mearent clym well yes suppose be sort of guardian in fact be of course said altogether perplexed a to drift be thinking of marrying then observed blandly will not marry unless assure that approve of such step why dont speak be taken rather by surprise nevertheless be very glad to hear such news will approve of course dear tamsie who can be be quite at loss to guess be nottis old doctornot mean to call old for be not very old after ahi noticed when attended last time said hastily ti mr venn clyms face suddenly became grave there now dont like wish hadnt mentioned exclaimed almost petulantly shouldnt have done either only keep on bothering so till dont know what to do clym looked at heath like venn well enough answered at last be very honest at same time astute man be clever too a be proved by having got to favour really thomasin be not quite gentleman enough for be just what feel be sorry now that asked wont think more of at same time must marry if marry will say dont see said clym carefully concealing clue to own interrupted intention plainly have not guessed might marry professional man somebody of sort by going into town to live forming acquaintance there be not fit for town lifeso very rural silly a always have be notice countrified way well when came home from paris did little dont now thats because have got countrified too o couldnt live in street for world egdon be ridiculous old place have got used to couldnt be happy anywhere else at must said clym then how must say must marry town man be sure say what will must marry diggory if marry at have be kinder to than anybody else have helped in many way dont know of thomasin almost pouted now yes have said clym in neutral tone well wish with heart must say marry can not forget what mother thought on matter go rather against not to respect opinion there be too much reason why must do little can to respect now very well then sighed thomasin will say no more be not bound to obey wish merely say what think o noi dont want to be rebellious in way said sadly have business to think of himi ought to have thought of family what dreadfully bad impulse there be in lip trembled turned away to hide tear clym though vexed at what seemed unaccountable taste be in measure relieved to find at rate marriage question in relation to be shelved through several succeeding day saw at different time from window of room moping disconsolately about garden be half angry with for choosing venn then be grieved at having put in way of venn happiness who be after a honest persevering young fellow a on egdon since have turned over new leaf in short clym did not know what to do when next met said abruptly be much more respectable now than be then who o yesdiggory venn aunt only objected because be reddleman well thomasin perhaps dont know particular of mother wish so have better use own discretion will always feel that slighted mother memory will not will think be convinced that have seen diggory in present position must have considered fitting husband for now thats real feeling dont consult more do a like thomasin will be content be to be supposed that thomasin be convinced for few day after when clym strayed into part of heath that have not lately visited humphrey who be at work there said to be glad to see that mr wildeve venn have made up again seemingly have said clym abstractedly yes do contrive to stumble upon whenever walk out on fine day with chiel mr yeobright cant help feeling that cousin ought to have married ti pity to make two chimleycorners where there need be only one must get away from now ti belief if be only to set about how can have conscience to marry after having driven two woman to death dont think thing humphrey after experience must consider too much of burlesque to go to church take wife in word of job have made covenant with mine eye when then must think upon maid mr clym dont fancy about driving two woman to death shouldnt say well well leave out said yeobright anyhow god have set mark upon wouldnt look well in love making scene have two idea in head others be going to keep night school be going to turn preacher what have got to say to humphrey ill come hear ee with heart thanks ti wish a clym descended into valley thomasin came down by other path met at gate what do think have to tell clym said looking archly over shoulder at can guess replied scrutinized face yes guess right be going to be after think may a well make up mind have got to think so too be to be on twenty fifth of next month if dont object do what think right dear be only too glad that see way clear to happiness again sex owes amends for treatment received in day gone by writer may state here that original conception of story did not design marriage between thomasin venn be to have retained isolated weird character to last to have disappeared mysteriously from heath nobody knowing whitherthomasin remaining widow certain circumstance of serial publication led to change of intent reader can therefore choose between ending with austere artistic code can assume more consistent conclusion to be true one iv cheerfulness again asserts at bloom end clym find vocation anybody who have passed through bloom end about eleven oclock on morning fixed for wedding must have found that while yeobrights house be comparatively quiet sound denoting great activity came from dwelling of nearest neighbour timothy fairway be chiefly noise of foot briskly crunching hither thither over

blieve bed be dear to fokes dont keep goose baint mister fairway said christian a to omniscient being yes said furze dealer standing up giving forehead thorough mopping handing beeswax to humphrey who succeeded at rubbing forthwith not that couple be in want of one twas well to show em bit of friendliness at great racketing vagary of life set up own daughter in one when be married there have be

venn mr venn yeobright grand relative of venn who have come from budmouth for occasion fly have be hired at nearest town regardless of distance cost there being nothing on egdon heath in venn opinion dignified enough for such event when woman a thomasin be bride church be too remote for walking bridal party a fly passed group have run out from homestead shouted hurrah waved hand feather down floating from hair sleeve fold of garment at motion grandfer cantle seal dancing merrily in sunlight a twirled about driver of fly turned supercilious gaze upon even treated wedded pair with something like condescension for in what other state than heathen must people rich poor exist who be doomed to abide in such world end a egdon thomasin showed such superiority to group at door fluttering hand a quickly a bird wing towards asking diggory with tear in eye if ought not to alight speak to kind neighbour venn however suggested that a be coming to house in evening be hardly necessary after excitement saluting party returned to occupation stuffing sewing be soon afterwards finished when fairway harnessed horse wrapped up cumbrous present drove off with in cart to venn house at stickleford yeobright having filled office at wedding service naturally fell to hand afterwards returned to house with husband wife be indisposed to take part in feasting dancing wound up evening

rainbarrow from distance there simply appeared to be motionless figure standing on top of tumulus just a eustacia have stood on lonely summit two year half before now be fine warm weather with only summer breeze blowing early afternoon instead of dull twilight who ascended to immediate neighbourhood of barrow perceived that erect form in centre piercing sky be not really alone round upon slope of barrow number of heathmen woman be reclining sitting at ease listened to word of man in midst who be preaching while abstractedly pulled stripped fern tossed pebble down slope be first of series of moral lecture sermon on mount be to be delivered from same place sunday afternoon a long a fine weather lasted commanding elevation of rainbarrow have be chosen for two reason first that occupied central position among remote cottage around secondly that preacher thereon must be seen from adjacent point a soon a arrived at post view of being thus convenient signal to straggler who wished to

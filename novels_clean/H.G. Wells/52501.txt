gesticulated with hand arm to face page looked back at receding figure sat across edge of manhole looked down into black interior watched intensely realised leap have be too violent insect murmured cavor insect there thing be looking at bedford whispered there sort of light in front of nearer struggled more awfully remote seemed carried into darkness grand lunar first men in moon mr bedford meet mr cavor at lympne a sit down to write here amidst shadow of vine leaf under blue sky of southern italy come to with certain quality of astonishment that participation in amazing adventure of mr cavor be after outcome of purest accident might have be one fell into thing at time when thought removed from slightest possibility of disturbing experience have gone to lympne because have imagined most uneventful place in world here at rate said will find peace chance to work book be sequel so utterly at variance be destiny with little plan of men may perhaps mention here very recently have come ugly cropper in certain business enterprise sitting now surrounded by circumstance of wealth there be luxury in admitting extremity can admit even to certain extent disaster be conceivably of own making may be there be direction in have capacity conduct of business operation be not among in day be young youth among other objectionable form took that of pride in capacity for affair be young still in year thing have happened to have rubbed something of youth from mind whether have brought wisdom to light below be more doubtful matter be scarcely necessary to go into detail of speculation landed at lympne in kent nowadays even about business transaction there be strong spice of adventure took risk in thing there be invariably certain amount of give take fell to finally to do giving reluctantly enough even when have got out of everything one cantankerous creditor saw fit to be malignant perhaps have met that flaming sense of outraged virtue perhaps have only felt ran hard seemed to at last that there be nothing for to write play unless wanted to drudge for living a clerk have certain imagination luxurious taste meant to make vigorous fight for before fate overtook in addition to belief in power a business man have always in day have idea be equal to writing very good play be not believe very uncommon persuasion knew there be nothing man can do outside legitimate business transaction have such opulent possibility very probably that biased opinion have indeed got into habit of regarding unwritten drama a convenient little reserve put by for rainy day rainy day have come set to work soon discovered that writing play be longer business than have supposed at first have reckoned ten day for be to have pied terre while be in hand came to lympne reckoned lucky in getting little bungalow got on three year agreement put in few stick of furniture while play be in hand did own cooking cooking must have shocked mr bond yet know have flavour have coffee pot sauce pan for egg one for potato frying pan for sausage bacon such be simple apparatus of comfort one can not always be magnificent simplicity be always possible alternative for rest laid in eighteen gallon cask of beer on credit trustful baker came day be not perhaps in style of sybaris have have worse time be little sorry for baker who be very decent man indeed even for hoped certainly if one want solitude place be lympne be in clay part of kent bungalow stood on edge of old sea cliff stared across flat of romney marsh at sea in very wet weather place be almost inaccessible have heard that at time postman used to traverse more succulent portion of route with board upon foot never saw doing so can quite imagine outside door of few cottage house make up present village big birch besom be stuck to wipe off worst of clay will give idea of texture of district doubt if place must be there at if be not fading memory of thing gone for ever be big port of england in roman time portus lemanus now sea be four mile away down steep hill be boulder mass of roman brickwork from old watling street still paved in place start like arrow to north used to stand on hill think of galley legion captive official woman trader speculator like swarm tumult came clanking in out of harbour now just few lump of rubble on grassy slope sheep two where port have be be level of marsh sweeping round in broad curve to distant dungeness dotted here there with tree clump church tower of old medival town be following lemanus now towards extinction outlook on marsh be indeed one of finest view have ever seen suppose dungeness be fifteen mile away lay like raft on sea further be hill by hastings under setting sun sometimes hung close clear sometimes be faded low often drift of weather took clean out of sight nearer part of marsh be laced lit by ditch canal window at worked looked over skyline of crest be from window that first set eye on cavor be just a be struggling with scenario holding down mind to sheer hard work of naturally enough arrested attention sun have set sky be vivid tranquillity of green yellow against that came out black oddest little figure be short round bodied thin legged little man with jerky quality in motion have seen fit to clothe extraordinary mind in cricket cap overcoat cycling knickerbockers stocking why did so know for never cycled never played cricket be fortuitous concurrence of garment arising know not how gesticulated with hand arm jerked head about buzzed buzzed like something electric never heard such buzzing ever again cleared throat with most extraordinary noise illustration gesticulated with hand arm there have be rain that spasmodic walk of be enhanced by extreme slipperiness of footpath exactly a came against sun stopped pulled out watch hesitated then with sort of convulsive gesture turned retreated with manifestation of haste no longer gesticulating going with ample stride showed relatively large size of foot be remember grotesquely exaggerated in size by adhesive clay to best possible advantage occurred on first day of sojourn when play writing energy be at height regarded incident simply a annoying distraction waste of five minute returned to scenario when next evening apparition be repeated with remarkable precision again next evening indeed evening when rain be not falling concentration upon scenario became considerable effort confound man said one must think be learning to be marionette for several evening cursed pretty heartily then annoyance gave way to amazement curiosity why on earth must man do thing on fourteenth evening must stand no longer so soon a appeared opened french window crossed verandah directed to point where invariably stopped have watch out a came up to have chubby rubicund face with reddish brown eye previously have seen only against light one moment sir said a turned stared one moment said certainly if wish to speak to for longer be not asking too much moment be up must trouble to accompany not in least said placing beside habit be regular time for intercourse limited presume be time for exercise be come here to enjoy sunset dont sir never look at never look at ive watched thirteen night not once have looked at sunset not once knitted brow like one who encounter problem well enjoy sunlight atmosphere go along path through gate jerked head over shoulder round dont never have be nonsense there isnt way to night for instance oh to night let see ah just glanced at watch saw that have already be out just three minute over precise half hour decided there be not time to go round turned always do looked at reflected perhaps do now come to think of what be wanted to speak to about why yes why do do night come making noise making noise like imitated buzzing noise looked at be evident buzzing awakened distaste do do that asked blessed evening have idea stopped dead regarded gravely can be said that have formed habit well look like doesnt pulled down lower lip between finger thumb regarded puddle at foot mind be much occupied said want to know why well sir can assure that not only do not know why do thing did not even know did come to think be just a say never have be beyond field thing annoy for reason be beginning to relent towards not annoy said imagine writing play couldnt well anything that need concentration ah said of course meditated expression became so eloquent of distress relented still more after there be touch of aggression in demanding of man dont know why hum on public footpath see said weakly habit oh recognise must stop not if put out after have business something of liberty not at sir said not at be greatly indebted to must guard against thing in future will must trouble once again that noise something like said zuzzoo zuzzoo really know be greatly obliged to in fact know be getting absurdly absent minded be quite justified sir perfectly justified indeed be indebted to thing will end now sir have already brought further than must have done do hope impertinence not at sir not at regarded other for moment raised hat wished good evening responded convulsively so went way at stile looked back at receding figure bearing have changed remarkably seemed limp contrast with former gesticulating zuzzoing took in absurd way a pathetic watched out of sight then wishing very heartily have kept to own business returned to bungalow play illustration looked back at receding figure next evening saw nothing of next be very much in mind have occurred to that a sentimental comic character might serve useful purpose in development of plot third day called upon for time be puzzled to think what have brought made indifferent conversation in most formal way then abruptly came to business wanted to buy out of bungalow see said dont blame in least youve destroyed habit disorganises day ive walked past here for year year doubt ive hummed youve made that impossible suggested might try other direction there be other direction be only one ive inquired now afternoon at four come to dead wall dear sir if thing be so important to vital see im im investigator be engaged in scientific research live paused seemed to think just over there said pointed suddenly dangerously near eye house with white chimney see just over tree circumstance be abnormal abnormal be on point of completing one of most important demonstration can assure one of most important demonstration have ever be made requires constant thought constant mental ease activity afternoon be brightest time effervescing with new idea new point of view why not come by still must be different must be conscious must think of at play watching irritated instead of thinking of work must have bungalow meditated naturally wanted to think matter over thoroughly before anything decisive be said be generally ready enough for business in day selling always attracted in first place be not bungalow even if sold to at good price might get inconvenienced in delivery of good if current owner got wind of transaction in second be well undischarged be clearly business required delicate handling moreover possibility of being in pursuit of valuable invention also interested occurred to must like to know more of research not with dishonest intention simply with idea to know what be must be relief from play writing threw out feeler be quite willing to supply information indeed once be fairly under way conversation became monologue talked like man long pent up who have have over with again again talked for nearly hour must confess found pretty stiff bit of listening through there be undertone of satisfaction one feel when one be neglecting work one have set oneself during first interview gathered very little of drift of work word be technicality entirely strange to illustrated one two point with what be pleased to call elementary mathematics computing on envelope with copying ink pencil in manner made hard even to seem to understand yes said yes go on nevertheless made out enough to convince that be mere crank playing at discovery in spite of crank like appearance there be force about that made that impossible whatever be be thing with mechanical possibility told of work shed have of three assistant originally jobbing carpenter whom have trained now from work shed to patent office be clearly only one step invited to see thing accepted readily took care by remark so to underline that proposed transfer of bungalow remained very conveniently in suspense at last rose to depart with apology for length of call talking over work be said pleasure enjoyed only too rarely be not often found intelligent listener a mingled very little with professional scientific men so much pettiness explained so much intrigue really when one have idea novel fertilising idea dont want to be uncharitable be man who belief in impulse made what be perhaps rash proposition must remember have be alone play writing in lympne for fourteen day compunction for ruined walk still hung about why not said make new habit in place of one spoilt at least until can settle about bungalow what want be to turn over work in mind that have always done during afternoon walk unfortunately thats over cant get thing back a be why not come talk about work to use a sort of wall against may throw thought catch again certain dont know enough to steal idea know scientific men stopped be considering evidently thing attracted im afraid must bore said think im too dull oh technicality anyhow youve interested immensely afternoon of course must be great help to nothing clear up one idea so much a explaining hitherto dear sir say more really can spare time there be rest like change of occupation said with profound conviction affair be over on verandah step turned be already greatly indebted to said made interrogative noise have completely cured of ridiculous habit of humming explained think said be glad to be of service to turned away immediately train of thought that conversation have suggested must have resumed sway arm began to wave in former fashion faint echo of zuzzoo came back to on breeze well after be not affair came next day again next day after delivered two lecture on physic to mutual satisfaction talked with air of being extremely lucid about ether tube of force gravitational potential thing like sat in other folding chair said yes go on follow to keep going be tremendously difficult stuff think ever suspected how much did not understand there be moment when doubted whether be well employed at rate be resting from confounded play now then thing gleamed on clearly for space only to vanish just when thought have hold of sometimes attention failed altogether must give up sit stare at wondering whether after must not be better to use a central figure in good farce let other stuff slide then perhaps must catch on again for bit at earliest opportunity went to see house be large carelessly furnished there be servant other than three assistant dietary private life be characterised by philosophical simplicity be water drinker vegetarian logical disciplinary thing sight of equipment settled many doubt looked like business from cellar to attic amazing little place to find in out of way village ground floor room contained bench apparatus bakehouse scullery boiler have developed into respectable furnace dynamo occupied cellar there be gasometer in garden showed to with confiding zest of man who have be living too much alone seclusion be overflowing now in excess of confidence have good luck to be recipient three assistant be creditable specimen of class of handy men from came conscientious if unintelligent strong civil willing one spargus who did cooking metal work have be sailor second gibbs be joiner third be ex jobbing gardener now general assistant be merest labourer intelligent work be done by cavor theirs be darkest ignorance compared even with muddled impression now a to nature of inquiry here unhappily come grave difficulty be scientific expert if be to attempt to set forth in highly scientific language of mr cavor aim to experiment tended be afraid must confuse not only reader almost certainly must make blunder must bring upon mockery of up to date student of mathematical physic in country best thing can do therefore be think to give impression in own inexact language without attempt to wear garment of knowledge to have claim object of mr cavors search be substance must be opaque used other word have forgotten opaque conveys idea to form of radiant energy radiant energy made understand be anything like light heat rntgen ray there be so much talk about year so ago electric wave of marconi gravitation thing said radiate out from centre act on body at distance whence come term radiant energy now almost substance be opaque to form other of radiant energy glass for example be transparent to light much le so to heat so that be useful a fire screen alum be transparent to light block heat completely solution of iodine in carbon bisulphide on other hand completely block light be quite transparent to heat will hide fire from permit warmth to reach metal be not only opaque to light heat also to electrical energy pass through iodine solution glass almost a though be not interposed so on now known substance be transparent to gravitation can use screen of various sort to cut off light heat electrical influence of sun warmth of earth from anything can screen thing by sheet of metal from marconi ray nothing will cut off gravitational attraction of sun gravitational attraction of earth yet why there must be nothing be hard to say cavor did not see why substance must not exist certainly must not tell have never thought of such possibility before showed by calculation on paper lord kelvin doubt professor lodge professor karl pearson of great scientific people might have understood simply reduced to hopeless muddle that not only be such substance possible that must satisfy certain condition be amazing piece of reasoning much a amazed exercised at time must be impossible to reproduce here yes said to yes go on suffice for story that believed might be able to manufacture possible substance opaque to gravitation out of complicated alloy of metal something new new element fancy called believe helium be sent to from london in sealed stone jar doubt have be thrown upon detail be almost certain be helium have sent in sealed stone jar be certainly something very gaseous thin if only have taken note then how be to foresee necessity of taking note one with merest germ of imagination will understand extraordinary possibility of such substance will sympathise little with emotion felt a understanding emerged from haze of abstruse phrase in cavor expressed comic relief in play indeed be time before must believe that have interpreted aright be very careful not to ask question must have enabled to gauge profundity of misunderstanding into dropped daily exposition one reading story of here will sympathise fully because from barren narrative will be impossible to gather strength of conviction that astonishing substance be positively going to be made recall gave play hour consecutive work at time after visit to house imagination have other thing to do there seemed limit to possibility of stuff whichever way tried came on miracle revolution for example if one wanted to lift weight however enormous one have only to get sheet of substance beneath one might lift with straw first natural impulse be to apply principle to gun ironclad material method of war from to shipping locomotion building conceivable form of human industry chance have brought into very birth chamber of new time be epoch le be one of chance come once in thousand year thing unrolled expanded expanded among other thing saw in redemption a business man saw parent company daughter company application to right of application to left ring trust privilege concession spreading spreading until one vast stupendous cavorite company ran ruled world be in took line straight away knew be staking everything jumped there then be on absolutely biggest thing have ever be invented said put accent on if want to keep out of youll have to do with gun im coming down to be fourth labourer to morrow seemed surprised at enthusiasm not bit suspicious hostile rather be self depreciatory looked at doubtfully do really think said play how about play vanished cried dear sir dont see what youve got dont see what youre going to do be merely rhetorical turn positively didnt at first must not believe have not have beginning of inkling of idea astonishing little man have be working on purely theoretical ground whole time when said be most important research world have ever seen simply meant squared up so many theory settled so much that be in doubt have troubled no more about application of stuff be going to turn out than if have be machine make gun be possible substance be going to make vla tout a frenchman say beyond that be childish if made must go down to posterity a cavorite cavorine must be made fr portrait given away a scientific worthy with nature thing like be saw must have dropped bombshell into world a though have discovered new specie of gnat if have not happened that have come along there must have lain fizzled like one two other little thing scientific people have lit dropped about when realised be did talking cavor who said go on jumped up paced room gesticulating like boy of twenty tried to make understand duty responsibility in matter duty responsibility in matter assured might make wealth enough to work sort of social revolution fancied might own order whole world told of company patent case for secret process thing seemed to take much a mathematics have taken look of perplexity came into ruddy little face stammered something about indifference to wealth brushed aside have got to be rich be good stammering gave to understand sort of man be that have have very considerable business experience did not tell be undischarged bankrupt at time because be temporary think reconciled evident poverty with financial claim quite insensibly in way such project grow understanding of cavorite monopoly grew up between be to make stuff be to make boom stuck like leech to didnt exist for idea be that profit spoke of might go to endow research that of course be matter have to settle later thats right shouted thats right great point a insisted be to get thing done here be substance cried home no factory fortress ship can dare to be without more universally applicable even than patent medicine there isnt solitary aspect of not one of ten thousand possible us will not make rich cavor beyond dream of avarice no said begin to see extraordinary how one get new point of view by talking over thing a happens have just talked to right man suppose one said be absolutely averse to enormous wealth of course there be one thing paused stood still be just possible know that may not be able to make after may be one of thing be theoretical possibility practical absurdity when make there may be little hitch well tackle hitch when come said ii first making of cavorite cavors fear be groundless so far a actual making be concerned on th of october incredible substance be made oddly enough be made at last by accident when mr cavor least expected have fused together number of metal certain other thing wish knew particular now intended to leave mixture week then allow to cool slowly unless have miscalculated last stage in combination must occur when stuff sank to temperature of fahr chanced that unknown to cavor dissension have arisen about furnace tending gibbs who have previously seen to have suddenly attempted to shift to man who have be gardener on score that coal be soil being dug therefore must not possibly fall within province of joiner man who have be jobbing gardener alleged however that coal be metallic ore like substance let alone that be cook spargus insisted on gibbs doing coaling seeing that be joiner coal be notoriously fossil wood consequently gibbs ceased to replenish furnace one else did so cavor be too much immersed in certain interesting problem concerning cavorite flying machine neglecting resistance of air one two other point to perceive that anything be wrong premature birth of invention took place just a be coming across field to bungalow for afternoon talk tea remember occasion with extreme vividness water be boiling everything be prepared sound of zuzzoo have brought out upon verandah active little figure be black against autumnal sunset to right chimney of house just rose above gloriously tinted group of tree remoter rose wealden hill faint blue while to left hazy marsh spread out spacious serene then chimney jerked heavenward smashing into string of brick a rose roof miscellany of furniture followed then overtaking came huge white flame tree about building swayed whirled tore to piece sprang towards flare ear be smitten with clap of thunder left deaf on one side for life about window smashed unheeded took three step from verandah towards cavors house even a did so came wind instantly coat tail be over head be progressing in great leap bound quite against will towards in same moment discoverer be seized whirled about flew through screaming air saw one of chimney pot hit ground within six yard of leap score of foot so hurry in great stride towards focus of disturbance cavor kicking flapping came down again rolled over over on ground for space struggled up be lifted borne forward at enormous velocity vanishing at last among labouring lashing tree that writhed about house mass of smoke ash square of bluish shining substance rushed up towards zenith large fragment of fencing came sailing past dropped edgeways hit ground fell flat then worst be over aerial commotion fell swiftly until be mere strong gale became once more aware that have breath foot by leaning back against wind managed to stop must collect such wit a still remained to in instant whole face of world have changed tranquil sunset have vanished sky be dark with scurrying cloud everything be flattened swaying with gale glanced back to see if bungalow be still in general way standing then staggered forward towards tree amongst cavor have vanished through whose tall leaf denuded branch shone flame of burning house entered copse dashing from one tree to clinging to for space sought in vain then amidst heap of smashed branch fencing have banked against portion of garden wall perceived something stir made run for before reached brown object separated rose on two muddy leg protruded two drooping bleeding hand tattered end of garment fluttered out from middle portion streamed before wind for moment did not recognise earthy lump then saw that be cavor caked in mud in have rolled leant forward against wind rubbing dirt from eye mouth extended muddy lump of hand staggered pace towards face worked with emotion little lump of mud kept falling from looked a damaged pitiful a living creature have ever seen remark therefore amazed exceeding gratulate gasped gratulate congratulate said good heaven what for ive done have what on earth caused that explosion gust of wind blew word away understood to say that wasnt explosion at wind hurled into collision with stood clinging to one try get back to bungalow bawled in ear did not hear shouted something about three martyr science also something about not much good at time laboured under impression that three attendant have perished in whirlwind happily be incorrect directly have left for bungalow have gone off to public house in lympne to discus question of furnace over trivial refreshment repeated suggestion of getting back to bungalow time understood clung arm in arm started managed at last to reach shelter of a much roof a be left to for space sat in arm chair panted window be broken lighter article of furniture be in great disorder irrevocable damage be done happily kitchen door have stood pressure upon so that crockery cooking material have survived oil stove be still burning put on water to boil again for tea that prepared must turn on cavor for explanation quite correct insisted quite correct ive done right protested right why there cant be rick standing fence thatched roof undamaged for twenty mile round right really didnt of course foresee little upset mind be preoccupied with problem im apt to disregard practical side issue right dear sir cried dont see youve done thousand of pound worth of damage there throw on discretion im not practical man of course dont think will regard a cyclone explosion be not explosion perfectly simple only a say im apt to overlook little thing that zuzzoo business on larger scale inadvertently made substance of mine cavorite in thin wide sheet paused be quite clear that stuff be opaque to gravitation that cut off thing from gravitating towards other yes said yes well so soon a reached temperature of fahr process of manufacture be complete air above portion of roof ceiling floor above ceased to have weight suppose know everybody know nowadays that a usual thing air have weight that press on everything at surface of earth press in direction with pressure of fourteen half pound to square inch know said go on know that too remarked only show how useless knowledge be unless apply see over cavorite ceased to be case air there ceased to exert pressure air round not over cavorite be exerting pressure of fourteen pound half to square inch upon suddenly weightless air ah begin to see air about cavorite crushed in upon air above with irresistible force air above cavorite be forced upward violently air rushed in to replace immediately lost weight ceased to exert pressure followed suit blew ceiling through roof off perceive said formed sort of atmospheric fountain kind of chimney in atmosphere if cavorite hadnt be loose so got sucked up chimney doe occur to what must have happened thought suppose said air must be rushing up up over infernal piece of stuff now precisely said huge fountain spouting into space good heaven why must have squirted atmosphere of earth away must have robbed world of air must have be death of mankind little lump of stuff not exactly into space said cavor a bad practically must have whipped air off world a one peel banana flung thousand of mile must have dropped back again of course on asphyxiated world from point of view very little better than if never came back stared a yet be too amazed to realise how expectation have be upset what do mean to do now asked in first place if may borrow garden trowel will remove of earth with be encased then if may avail myself of domestic convenience will have bath done will converse more at leisure will be wise think laid muddy hand on arm if nothing be said of affair beyond ourselves know have caused great damage probably even dwelling house may be ruined here there upon country side on other hand can not possibly pay for damage have done if real cause of be published will lead only to heart burning obstruction of work one can not foresee everything know can not consent for one moment to add burthen of practical consideration to theorising later on when have come in with practical mind cavorite be floated floated be word isnt have realised anticipate for may set matter right with person not now not now if other explanation be offered people in present unsatisfactory state of meteorological science will ascribe to cyclone there might be public subscription a house have collapsed be burnt must in case receive considerable share in compensation must be extremely helpful to prosecution of research if be known that caused there will be public subscription everybody will be put out practically must never get chance of working in peace again three assistant may may not have perished be detail if have be great loss be more zealous than able premature event must be largely due to joint neglect of furnace if have not perished doubt if have intelligence to explain affair will accept cyclone story if during temporary unfitness of house for occupation may lodge in one of untenanted room of bungalow of yours paused regarded man of such possibility reflected be ordinary guest to entertain perhaps said rising to foot have better begin by looking for trowel led way to scattered vestige of greenhouse while be having bath considered entire question alone be clear there be drawback to mr cavors society have not foreseen absent mindedness have just escaped depopulating terrestrial globe might at moment result in other grave inconvenience on other hand be young affair be in mess be in just mood for reckless adventure with chance of something good at end of have quite settled in mind be to have half at least in aspect of affair fortunately held bungalow a have already explained on three year agreement without being responsible for repair furniture such a there be of have be hastily purchased be unpaid for insured altogether devoid of association in end decided to keep on with see business through certainly aspect of thing have changed very greatly no longer doubted at enormous possibility of substance began to have doubt about gun carriage patent boot set to work at once to reconstruct laboratory proceed with experiment cavor talked more on level than have ever done before when came to question of how must make stuff next of course must make again said with sort of glee have not expected in of course must make again have caught tartar perhaps have left theoretical behind for good if can possibly avoid wrecking little planet of ours will there must be risk there must be in experimental work there always be here a practical man must come in for own part seems to might make edgeways perhaps very thin yet dont know have certain dim perception of method can hardly explain yet curiously enough came into mind while be rolling over over in mud before wind very doubtful how whole adventure be to end a being absolutely thing ought to have done even with aid found little difficulty meanwhile kept at work restoring laboratory there be plenty to do before be absolutely necessary to decide upon precise form method of second attempt only hitch be strike of three labourer who objected to activity a foreman that matter compromised after two day delay iii building of sphere remember occasion very distinctly when cavor told of idea of sphere have have intimation of before at time seemed to come to in rush be returning to bungalow for tea on way fell humming suddenly shouted thats that finish sort of roller blind finish what asked space anywhere moon what do mean mean why must be sphere thats what mean saw be out of for time let talk in own fashion hadnt ghost of idea then of drift after have taken tea made clear to like said last time ran stuff cut thing off from gravitation into flat tank with overlap held down directly have cooled manufacture be completed uproar happened nothing above weighed anything air went squirting up house squirted up if stuff hadnt squirted up too dont know what must have happened suppose substance be loose quite free to go up will go up at once exactly with more disturbance than firing big gun what good will do im going up with put down teacup stared at imagine sphere explained large enough to hold two people luggage will be made of steel lined with thick glass will contain proper store of solidified air concentrated food water distilling apparatus so forth enamelled a be on outer steel cavorite yes how will get inside there be similar problem about dumpling yes know how thats perfectly easy air tight manhole be be needed that of course will have to be little complicated there will have to be valve so that thing may be thrown out if necessary without much loss of air like jules verne thing in trip to moon cavor be not reader of fiction begin to see said slowly must get in screw up while cavorite be warm a soon a cooled must become impervious to gravitation off must fly at tangent must go off in straight line stopped abruptly what be to prevent thing travelling in straight line into space for ever asked youre not safe to get anywhere if do how will get back ive just thought of said cavor thats what meant when said thing be finished inner glass sphere can be air tight except for manhole continuous steel sphere can be made in section section capable of rolling up after fashion of roller blind can easily be worked by spring released checked by electricity conveyed by platinum wire fused through glass be merely question of detail so see that except for thickness of blind roller cavorite exterior of sphere will consist of window blind whichever like to call well when window blind be shut light heat gravitation radiant energy of sort will get at inside of sphere will fly on through space in straight line a say open window imagine one of window open then at once heavy body chance to be in direction will attract sat taking in see said oh see practically will be able to tack about in space just a wish get attracted by that oh yes thats clear enough only well dont quite see what will do for really only jumping off world back again surely for example one might go to moon when one got there what must find must see oh consider new knowledge be there air there there may be fine idea said strike a large order same moon id much rather try smaller thing first theyre out of question because of air difficulty why not apply that idea of spring blind cavorite blind in strong steel case to lifting weight wouldnt work insisted after to go into outer space be not so much worse if at than polar expedition men go on polar expedition not business men besides get paid for polar expedition if anything go wrong there be relief party just firing off world for nothing call prospecting youll have to call that one might make book of perhaps said have doubt there will be mineral said cavor for example oh sulphur ore gold perhaps possibly new element cost of carriage said know youre not practical man moon quarter of million mile away seems to wouldnt cost much to cart weight anywhere if packed in cavorite case have not thought of delivered free on head of purchaser eh isnt a though be confined to moon mean there mar clear atmosphere novel surroundings exhilarating sense of lightness might be pleasant to go there be there air on mar oh yes seems a though might run a sanatorium by way how far be mar two hundred million mile at present said cavor airily go close by sun imagination be picking up again after said there something in thing there travel extraordinary possibility came rushing into mind suddenly saw a in vision whole solar system threaded with cavorite liner sphere de luxe right of pre emption came floating into head planetary right of pre emption recalled old spanish monopoly in american gold wasnt a though be just planet that be of stared at cavors rubicund face suddenly imagination be leaping dancing stood up walked up down tongue be unloosened im beginning to take in said im beginning to take in transition from doubt to enthusiasm seemed to take scarcely time at be tremendous cried be imperial havent be dreaming of sort of thing once chill of opposition be removed own pent up excitement have play too got up paced too gesticulated shouted behaved like men inspired be men inspired well settle that said in answer to incidental difficulty have pulled up well soon settle well start drawing for moulding very night well start now responded hurried off to laboratory to begin upon work forthwith be like child in wonderland night dawn found still at work kept electric light going heedless of day remember now exactly how drawing looked shaded tinted while cavor drew smudged haste marked be in line wonderfully correct got out order for steel blind frame needed from that night work glass sphere be designed within week gave up afternoon conversation old routine altogether worked slept ate when must work no longer for hunger fatigue enthusiasm infected even three men though have idea what sphere be for through day man gibbs gave up walking went everywhere even across room at sort of fussy run grew sphere december passed january spent day with broom sweeping path through snow from bungalow to laboratory february march by end of march completion be in sight in january have come team of horse huge packing case have thick glass sphere now ready in position under crane have rigged to sling into steel shell bar blind of steel shell be not really spherical shell polyhedral with roller blind to facet have arrived by february lower half be bolted together cavorite be half made by march metallic paste have gone through two of stage in manufacture have plastered quite half of on to steel bar blind be astonishing how closely kept to line of cavors first inspiration in working out scheme when bolting together of sphere be finished proposed to remove rough roof of temporary laboratory in work be done build furnace about so last stage of cavorite making in paste be heated to dull red glow in stream of helium must be accomplished when be already on sphere then have to discus decide what provision be to take compressed food concentrated essence steel cylinder containing reserve oxygen arrangement for removing carbonic acid waste from air restoring oxygen by mean of sodium peroxide water condenser so forth remember little heap made in corner tin roll box convincingly matter of fact be strenuous time with little chance of thinking one day when be drawing near end odd mood came over have be bricking up furnace morning sat down by possession dead beat everything seemed dull incredible look here cavor said after whats for smiled thing now be to go moon reflected what do expect thought moon be dead world shrugged shoulder what do expect be going to see be said stared before be tired remarked youd better take walk afternoon said obstinately im going to finish brickwork did insured night of insomnia dont think have ever have night have bad time before business collapse very worst of be sweet slumber compared to infinity of aching wakefulness be suddenly in most enormous funk at thing be going to do remember before night thinking at of risk be running now came like array of spectre once beleaguered prague camped around strangeness of what be about to do unearthliness of overwhelmed be like man awakened out of pleasant dream to most horrible surroundings lay eye wide open sphere seemed to get more flimsy feeble cavor more unreal fantastic whole enterprise madder madder moment got out of bed wandered about sat at window stared at immensity of space between star be void unfathomable darkness tried to recall fragmentary knowledge of astronomy have gained in irregular reading be too vague to furnish idea of thing might expect at last got back to bed snatched moment of sleep moment of nightmare rather in fell fell fell for evermore into abyss of sky astonished cavor at breakfast told shortly im not coming with in sphere met protest with sullen persistence thing too mad said wont come thing too mad must not go with to laboratory fretted about bungalow for time then took stick set off alone knew not whither chanced to be glorious morning warm wind deep blue sky first green of spring abroad multitude of bird singing lunched on beef beer in little public house near elham startled landlord by remarking apropos of weather man who leaf world when day of sort be about be fool thats what say when heerd on said landlord found that for one poor soul at least world have proved excessive there have be throat cutting went on with new twist to thought in afternoon have pleasant sleep in sunny place went way refreshed came to comfortable looking inn near canterbury be bright with creeper landlady be clean old woman took eye found have just enough money to pay for lodging with decided to stop night there be talkative body among many other particular learnt have never be to london canterbury a far a ever be said im not one of gad about sort how must like trip to moon cried never did hold with ballooneys said evidently under impression that be common excursion enough wouldnt go up in one not for ever so struck a being funny after have supped sat on bench by door of inn gossiped with two labourer about brick making motor car cricket of last year in sky faint new crescent blue vague a distant alp sank westward over sun next day returned to cavor be coming said ive be little out of order thats be only time felt serious doubt of enterprise nerve purely after worked little more carefully took trudge for hour day at last save for heating in furnace labour be at end iv inside sphere go on said cavor a sat across edge of manhole looked down into black interior of sphere two be alone be evening sun have set stillness of twilight be upon everything drew other leg inside slid down smooth glass to bottom of sphere then turned to take can of food other impedimenta from cavor interior be warm thermometer stood at eighty a must lose little none of by radiation be dressed in shoe thin flannel have however bundle of thick woollen clothing several thick blanket to guard against mischance by cavors direction placed package cylinder of oxygen so forth loosely about foot soon have everything in walked about roofless shed for time seeking anything have overlooked then crawled in after noted something in hand illustration sat across edge of manhole looked down into black interior what have got there asked havent brought anything to read good lord forgot to tell there be uncertainty voyage may last may be week will be floating in sphere with absolutely occupation wish id known peered out of manhole look said there something there be there time will be hour looked out be old number of tit bit that one of men must have brought further away in corner saw torn lloyd news scrambled back into sphere with thing what have got said took book from hand read work of william shakespeare coloured slightly education have be so purely scientific said apologetically never read never knew little know in irregular sort of way precisely what be told said cavor assisted to screw in glass cover of manhole then pressed stud to close corresponding blind in outer case little oblong of twilight vanished be in darkness for time neither of spoke although case must not be impervious to sound everything be very still perceived there be nothing to grip when shock of start must come realised must be uncomfortable for want of chair why have chair asked ive settled said cavor shant need why not will see said in tone of man who refuse to talk became silent suddenly have come to clear vivid be fool to be inside sphere even now asked be too late to withdraw world outside sphere knew must be cold inhospitable enough to for week have be living on subsidy from cavor after must be a cold a infinite zero a inhospitable a empty space if have not be for appearance of cowardice believe that even then must have made let out hesitated on score hesitated grew fretful angry time passed there came little jerk noise like champagne being uncorked in room faint whistling sound for just one instant have sense of enormous tension transient conviction that foot be pressing downward with force of countless ton lasted for infinitesimal time stirred to action cavor said into darkness nerve in rag dont think stopped made answer confound cried im fool what business have here im not coming cavor thing too risky im getting out cant said cant well soon see about made answer for ten second too late for to quarrel now bedford said that little jerk be start already be flying a swiftly a bullet up into gulf of space said then didnt seem to matter what happened for time be a be stunned have nothing to say be just a if have never heard of idea of leaving world before then perceived unaccountable change in bodily sensation be feeling of lightness of unreality coupled with be queer sensation in head apoplectic effect almost thumping of blood vessel at ear of feeling diminished a time went on at last got so used to that experienced inconvenience heard click little glow lamp came into being saw cavors face a white a felt own to be regarded one in silence transparent blackness of glass behind made seem a though floated in void well be committed said at last yes said be committed dont move exclaimed at suggestion of gesture let muscle keep quite lax a if be in bed be in little universe of own look at thing pointed to loose case bundle have be lying on blanket in bottom of sphere be astonished to see that be floating now nearly foot from spherical wall then saw from shadow that cavor be no longer leaning against glass thrust out hand behind found that too be suspended in space clear of glass did not cry out gesticulate fear came upon be like being held lifted by something know not what mere touch of hand against glass moved rapidly understood what have happened did not prevent being afraid be cut off from exterior gravitation only attraction of object within sphere have effect consequently everything be not fixed to glass be falling slowly because of slightness of mass towards centre of gravity of little world seemed to be somewhere about middle of sphere rather nearer to myself than cavor on account of greater weight must turn round said cavor float back to back with thing between be strangest sensation conceivable floating thus loosely in space at first indeed horribly strange when horror passed not disagreeable at exceeding restful indeed nearest thing in earthly experience to that know be lying on very thick soft feather bed quality of utter detachment independence have not reckoned on thing like have expected violent jerk at starting giddy sense of speed instead felt a if be disembodied be not like beginning of journey be like beginning of dream v journey to moon presently cavor extinguished light said have not overmuch energy stored that what have must economise for reading for time whether be long short know there be nothing blank darkness question floated up out of void how be pointing said what be direction be flying away from earth at tangent a moon be near third quarter be going somewhere towards will open blind came click then window in outer case yawned open sky outside be a black a darkness within sphere shape of open window be marked by infinite number of star who have only seen starry sky from earth can not imagine appearance when vague half luminous veil of air have be withdrawn star see on earth be mere scattered survivor penetrate misty atmosphere now at last must realise meaning of host of heaven stranger thing be presently to see that airless star dusted sky of thing think will be one of last will forget little window vanished with click beside snapped open instantly closed then third for moment have to close eye because of blinding splendour of waning moon for space have to stare at cavor white lit thing about to season eye to light again before must turn towards that pallid glare four window be open in order that gravitation of moon might act upon substance in sphere found be no longer floating freely in space that foot be resting on glass in direction of moon blanket case of provision be also creeping slowly down glass presently came to rest so a to block out portion of view seemed to of course that looked down when looked at moon on earth down mean earthward way thing fall up reverse direction now pull of gravitation be towards moon for knew to contrary earth be overhead of course when cavorite blind be closed down be towards centre of sphere up towards outer wall be curiously unlike earthly experience too to have light coming up to one on earth light fall from above come slanting down sideways here came from beneath foot to see shadow have to look up at first gave sort of vertigo to stand only on thick glass look down upon moon through hundred of thousand of mile of vacant space sickness passed very speedily then splendour of sight reader may imagine best if will lie on ground warm summer night look between upraised foot at moon for reason probably because absence of air made so much more luminous moon seemed already considerably larger than doe from earth minutest detail of surface be acutely clear since did not see through air outline be bright sharp there be glow halo about star dust covered sky came right to very margin marked outline of unilluminated part a stood stared at moon between foot that perception of impossible have be with off on ever since start returned again with tenfold conviction cavor said take queerly company be going to run about mineral well dont see em here said cavor youll get over suppose im made to turn right side up again still for moment must half believe there never be world copy of lloyd news might help stared at paper for moment then held above level of face found must read quite easily struck column of mean little advertisement gentleman of private mean be willing to lend money read knew that gentleman then somebody eccentric wanted to sell cutaway bicycle quite new cost for five pound lady in distress wished to dispose of fish knife fork wedding present at great sacrifice doubt simple soul be sagely examining knife fork triumphantly riding off on bicycle third trustfully consulting that benevolent gentleman of mean even a read laughed let paper drift from hand be visible from earth asked why knew one who be rather interested in astronomy occurred to that must be rather odd if friend chanced to be looking through telescope must need most powerful telescope on earth even now to see a minutest speck for time stared in silence at moon world said one feel infinitely more than one ever did on earth people perhaps people exclaimed banish think sort of ultra arctic voyager exploring desolate place of space look at waved hand at shining whiteness below dead dead vast extinct volcano lava wilderness tumbled waste of snow frozen carbonic acid frozen air everywhere landslip seam crack gulf nothing happens men have watched planet systematically with telescope for over two hundred year how much change do think have seen none have traced two indisputable landslip doubtful crack one slight periodic change of colour thats didnt know theyd traced even that oh yes a for people by way asked how small thing will biggest telescope show upon moon one must see fair sized church one must certainly see town building anything like handiwork of men there might perhaps be insect something in way of ant for example so that must hide in deep burrow from lunar night new sort of creature having earthly parallel be most probable thing if be to find life there at think of difference in condition life must fit to day a long a fourteen earthly day cloudless sun blaze of fourteen day then night of equal length growing ever colder colder under cold sharp star in night there must be cold ultimate cold absolute zero c below earthly freezing point life there be must hibernate through rise again day mused one can imagine something worm like said taking air solid a earth worm swallow earth thick skinned monster by bye said why didnt bring gun did not answer question no concluded just have to go will see when get there remembered something of course there mineral anyhow said whatever condition may be presently told wished to alter course little by letting earth tug at for moment be going to open one earthward blind for thirty second warned that must make head swim advised to extend hand against glass to break fall did a directed thrust foot against bale of food case air cylinder to prevent falling upon then with click window flew open fell clumsily upon hand face saw for moment between black extended finger mother earth planet in downward sky be still very near cavor told distance be perhaps eight hundred mile huge terrestrial disk filled heaven already be plain to see that world be globe land below be in twilight vague westward vast grey stretch of atlantic shone like molten silver under receding day think recognised cloud dimmed coast line of france spain south of england then with click shutter closed again found in state of extraordinary confusion sliding slowly over smooth glass when at last thing settled in mind again seemed quite beyond question that moon be down under foot that earth be somewhere away on level of horizon earth have be down to kindred since beginning of thing so slight be exertion required of so easy did practical annihilation of weight make have to do that necessity for taking refreshment did not occur to for nearly six hour by cavors chronometer after start be amazed at lapse of time even then be satisfied with very little cavor examined apparatus for absorbing carbonic acid water pronounced to be in satisfactory order consumption of oxygen having be extraordinarily slight talk being exhausted for time there being nothing further for to do gave way to curious drowsiness have come upon spreading blanket on bottom of sphere in such manner a to shut out most of moonlight wished other good night almost immediately fell asleep so sleeping sometimes talking reading little at time eating although without keenness of appetite for most part in sort of quiescence be waking slumber fell through space of time have night day in silently softly swiftly down towards moon footnote be curious thing while be in sphere felt not slightest desire for food did feel want of when abstained at first forced appetite afterwards fasted completely altogether did not consume one hundredth part of compressed provision have brought with amount of carbonic acid breathed be also unnaturally low why be so be quite unable to explain vi landing on moon remember how one day cavor suddenly opened six of shutter blinded so cried aloud at whole area be moon stupendous scimitar of white dawn with edge hacked out by notch of darkness crescent shore of ebbing tide of darkness out of peak pinnacle came climbing into blaze of sun take reader have seen picture photograph of moon so need not describe broader feature of landscape spacious ringlike range vaster than terrestrial mountain summit shining in day shadow harsh deep grey disordered plain ridge hill craterlets passing at last from blazing illumination into common mystery of black athwart world be flying scarcely hundred mile above crest pinnacle now must see what eye on earth will ever see that under blaze of day harsh outline of rock ravine of plain crater floor grew grey indistinct under thickening haze that white of lit surface broke into lump patch broke again shrank vanished that here there strange tint of brown olive grew spread little time have for watching then for now have come to real danger of journey have to drop ever closer to moon a spun about to slacken pace watch chance until at last must dare to drop upon surface for cavor be time of intense exertion for be anxious inactivity seemed perpetually to be getting out of way leapt about sphere from point to point with agility must have be impossible on earth be perpetually opening closing cavorite window making calculation consulting chronometer by mean of glow lamp during last eventful hour for long time have window closed hung silently in darkness hurling through space then be feeling for shutter stud suddenly four window be open staggered covered eye drenched scorched blinded by unaccustomed splendour of sun beneath foot then again shutter snapped leaving brain spinning in darkness pressed against eye after floated in vast black silence then cavor switched on electric light told proposed to bind luggage together with blanket about against concussion of descent did with window closed because in way good arranged naturally at centre of sphere that too be strange business two men floating loose in spherical space packing pulling rope imagine if can no up down effort resulting in unexpected movement now must be pressed against glass with full force of cavors thrust now must be kicking helplessly in void now star of electric light must be overhead now under foot now cavors foot must float up before eye now must be crossway to other at last good be safely bound together in big soft bale except two blanket with head hole that be to wrap about then for flash cavor opened window moonward saw that be dropping towards huge central crater with number of minor crater grouped in sort of cross about then again cavor flung little sphere open to scorching blinding sun think be using sun attraction a brake cover with blanket cried thrusting from for moment did not understand then hauled blanket from beneath foot got about over head eye abruptly closed shutter again snapped one open again closed then suddenly began snapping open safely into steel roller there came jar then be rolling over over bumping against glass against big bale of luggage clutching at other outside white substance splashed a if be rolling down slope of snow over clutch bump clutch bump over came thud be half buried under bale of possession for space everything be still then must hear cavor puffing grunting snapping of shutter in sash made effort thrust back blanket wrapped luggage emerged from beneath open window be just visible a deeper black set with star be still alive be lying in darkness of shadow of wall of great crater into have fallen sat getting breath again feeling bruise on limb dont think of have have very clear expectation of such rough handling a have received struggled painfully to foot now said to look at landscape of moon tremendously dark cavor glass be dewy a spoke wiped at with blanket be hour so beyond day said must wait be impossible to distinguish anything might have be in sphere of steel for must see rubbing with blanket simply smeared glass a fast a wiped became opaque again with freshly condensed moisture mixed with increasing quantity of blanket hair of course ought not to have used blanket in effort to clear glass slipped upon damp surface hurt shin against one of oxygen cylinder protruded from bale thing be exasperating be absurd here be just arrived upon moon amidst knew not what wonder must see be grey streaming wall of bubble in have come confound said at rate might have stopped at home squatted on bale shivered drew blanket closer about abruptly moisture turned to spangle frond of frost can reach electric heater said cavor yes black knob will freeze did not wait to be told twice now said what be to do wait said wait of course will have to wait until air get warm again then glass will clear cant do anything till then night here yet must wait for day to overtake meanwhile dont feel hungry for space did not answer sat fretting turned reluctantly from smeared puzzle of glass stared at face yes said be hungry feel somehow enormously disappointed have expected dont know what have expected not summoned philosophy rearranging blanket about sat down on bale again began first meal on moon dont think finished forget presently first in patch then running rapidly together into wider space came clearing of glass came drawing of misty veil hid moon world from eye peered out upon landscape of moon vii sunrise on moon a saw first be wildest most desolate of scene be in enormous amphitheatre vast circular plain floor of giant crater cliff like wall closed in on side from westward light of unseen sun fell upon reaching to very foot of cliff showed disordered escarpment of drab greyish rock lined here there with bank crevice of snow be perhaps dozen mile away at first intervening atmosphere diminished in slightest minutely detailed brilliancy with thing glared at stood out clear dazzling against background of starry blackness seemed to earthly eye rather gloriously spangled velvet curtain than spaciousness of sky eastward cliff be at first merely starless selvedge to starry dome rosy flush creeping pallor announced commencing day only corona zodiacal light huge cone shaped luminous haze pointing up towards splendour of morning star warned of imminent nearness of sun light be about be reflected by westward cliff showed huge undulating plain cold grey grey deepened eastward into absolute raven darkness of cliff shadow innumerable rounded grey summit ghostly hummock billow of snowy substance stretching crest beyond crest into remote obscurity gave first inkling of distance of crater wall hummock looked like snow at time thought be snow be not be mound mass of frozen air so be at first then sudden swift amazing came lunar day sunlight have crept down cliff touched drifted mass at base incontinently came striding with seven leagued boot towards distant cliff seemed to shift quiver at touch of dawn reek of grey vapour poured upward from crater floor whirl puff drifting wraith of grey thicker broader denser until at last whole westward plain be steaming like wet handkerchief held before fire westward cliff be more than refracted glare beyond be air said cavor must be air must not rise like at mere touch of sunbeam at pace peered upwards look said what asked in sky already on blackness little touch of blue see star seem larger little one dim nebulosities saw in empty space be hidden swiftly steadily day approached grey summit after grey summit be overtaken by blaze turned to smoking white intensity at last there be nothing to west of bank of surging tumultuous advance ascent of cloudy haze distant cliff have receded further further have loomed changed through whirl foundered vanished at last in confusion nearer came that steaming advance nearer nearer coming a fast a shadow of cloud before south west wind about rose thin anticipatory haze cavor gripped arm what said look sunrise sun turned about pointed to brow of eastward cliff looming above haze about scarce lighter than darkness of sky now line be marked by strange reddish shape tongue of vermilion flame writhed danced fancied must be spiral of vapour have caught light made crest of fiery tongue against sky indeed be solar prominence saw crown of fire about sun be forever hidden from earthly eye by atmospheric veil then sun steadily inevitably came brilliant line came thin edge of intolerable effulgence took circular shape became bow became blazing sceptre hurled shaft of heat at a though be spear seemed verily to stab eye cried aloud turned about blinded groping for blanket beneath bale with incandescence came sound first sound have reached from without since left earth hissing rustling stormy trailing of aerial garment of advancing day with coming of sound light sphere lurched blinded dazzled staggered helplessly against other lurched again hissing grew louder have shut eye perforce be making clumsy effort to cover head with blanket second lurch sent helplessly off foot fell against bale opening eye have momentary glimpse of air just outside glass be running be boiling like snow into white hot rod be thrust have be solid air have suddenly at touch of sun become paste mud slushy liquefaction that hissed bubbled into gas there came still more violent whirl of sphere have clutched one in moment be spun about again round went over then be on four lunar dawn have hold of meant to show little men what moon must do with caught second glimpse of thing without puff of vapour half liquid slush excavated sliding falling sliding dropped into darkness went down with cavors knee in chest then seemed to fly away from for moment lay with breath out of body staring upward toppling crag of melting stuff have splashed over buried now thinned boiled off saw bubble dancing on glass above heard cavor exclaiming feebly then huge landslip in thawing air have caught spluttering expostulation began to roll down slope rolling faster faster leaping crevasse rebounding from bank faster faster westward into white hot boiling tumult of lunar day clutching at one spun about pitched way that bale of package leaping at pounding at collided gripped be torn asunder head met whole universe burst into fiery dart star on earth must have smashed one dozen time on moon luckily for weight be only one sixth of what be terrestrially fell very mercifully recall sensation of utter sickness feeling a if brain be upside down within skull then something be at work upon face thin feeler worried ear then discovered brilliance of landscape around be mitigated by blue spectacle cavor bent over saw face upside down eye also protected by tinted goggles breath came irregularly lip be bleeding from bruise better said wiping blood with back of hand everything seemed swaying for space be simply giddiness perceived that have closed of shutter in outer sphere to save from direct blaze of sun be aware that everything about be very brilliant lord gasped craned neck to see perceived there be blinding glare outside utter change from gloomy darkness of first impression have be insensible long asked dont know chronometer be broken little time dear chap have be afraid lay for space taking in saw face still bore evidence of emotion for while said nothing passed inquisitive hand over contusion surveyed face for similar damage back of right hand have suffered most be skinless raw forehead be bruised have bled handed little measure with of restorative forget name of have brought with after time felt little better began to stretch limb carefully soon must talk have done said a though there have be no interval wouldnt thought hand hanging over knee peered through glass then stared at good lord said what have happened asked after pause have jumped to tropic be a expected air have evaporated if be air at rate have evaporated surface of moon be showing be lying on bank of earthy rock here there bare soil be exposed queer sort of soil occurred to that be unnecessary to explain assisted into sitting position must see with own eye viii lunar morning harsh emphasis pitiless black white of scenery have altogether disappeared glare of sun have taken upon faint tinge of shadow upon cliff of crater wall be deeply purple to eastward dark bank of fog still crouched sheltered from sunrise to westward sky be blue clear began to realise length of insensibility be no longer in void atmosphere have arisen about outline of thing have gained in character have grown acute varied save for shadowed space of white substance here there white substance be longer air snow arctic appearance have gone altogether everywhere broad rusty brown space of bare tumbled earth spread to blaze of sun here there at edge of snowdrift be transient little pool eddy of water only thing stirring in expanse of barrenness sunlight inundated upper two blind of sphere turned climate to high summer foot be still in shadow sphere be lying upon drift of snow scattered here there upon slope emphasised by little white thread of unthawed snow upon shady side be shape like stick dry twisted stick of same rusty hue a rock upon lay that caught one thought sharply stick on lifeless world then a eye grew more accustomed to texture of substance perceived that almost surface have fibrous texture like carpet of brown needle one find beneath shade of pine tree cavor said yes may be dead world now once something arrested attention have discovered among needle number of little round object seemed to that one of have moved cavor whispered what did not answer at once stared incredulous for instant must not believe eye gave inarticulate cry gripped arm pointed look cried finding tongue there yes there eye followed pointing finger eh said how can describe thing saw be so petty thing to state yet seemed so wonderful so pregnant with emotion have said that amidst stick like litter be rounded body little oval body might have passed a very small pebble now first one then have stirred have rolled over cracked down crack of of showed minute line of yellowish green thrusting outward to meet hot encouragement of newly risen sun for moment be then there stirred burst third be seed said cavor then heard whisper very softly life life immediately poured upon that vast journey have not be made in vain that have come to arid waste of mineral to world lived moved watched intensely remember kept rubbing glass before with sleeve jealous of faintest suspicion of mist illustration watched intensely picture be clear vivid only in middle of field about centre dead fibre seed be magnified distorted by curvature of glass must see enough one after down sunlit slope miraculous little brown body burst gaped apart like seed pod like husk of fruit opened eager mouth drank in heat light pouring in cascade from newly risen sun moment more of seed coat ruptured even a did so swelling pioneer overflowed rent distended seed case passed into second stage of growth with steady assurance swift deliberation amazing seed thrust rootlet downward to earth queer little bundle like bud into air in little while whole slope be dotted with minute plantlet standing at attention in blaze of sun did not stand for long bundle like bud swelled strained opened with jerk thrusting out coronet of little sharp tip spreading whorl of tiny spiky brownish leaf lengthened rapidly lengthened visibly even a watched movement be slower than animal swifter than plant have ever seen before how can suggest to way that growth went on leaf tip grew so that moved onward even while looked at brown seed case shrivelled be absorbed with equal rapidity have ever on cold day taken thermometer into warm hand watched little thread of mercury creep up tube moon plant grew like in few minute a seemed bud of more forward of plant have lengthened into stem be even putting forth second whorl of leaf slope have seemed so recently lifeless stretch of litter be now dark with stunted olive green herbage of bristling spike swayed with vigour of growing turned about behold along upper edge of rock to eastward similar fringe in scarcely le forward condition swayed bent dark against blinding glare of sun beyond fringe be silhouette of plant mass branching clumsily like cactus swelling visibly swelling like bladder fill with air then to westward also discovered that such distended form be rising over scrub here light fell upon sleek side must see that colour be vivid orange hue rose a one watched if one looked away from for minute then back outline have changed thrust out blunt congested branch until in little time rose coralline shape of many foot in height compared with growth terrestrial puff ball will sometimes swell foot in diameter in single night must be hopeless laggard then puff ball grows against gravitational pull six time of moon beyond out of gully flat have be hidden from not from quickening sun over reef bank of shining rock bristling beard of spiky fleshy vegetation be straining into view hurrying tumultuously to take advantage of brief day in must flower fruit seed again die be like miracle growth so one must imagine tree plant arose at creation covered desolation of new made earth imagine imagine that dawn resurrection of frozen air stirring quickening of soil then silent uprising of vegetation unearthly ascent of fleshiness spike conceive lit by blaze must make intensest sunlight of earth seem watery weak still around stirring jungle wherever there be shadow lingered bank of bluish snow to have picture of impression complete must bear in mind that saw through thick bent glass distorting a thing be distorted by lens acute only in centre of picture very bright there towards edge magnified unreal ix prospecting begin ceased to gaze turned to other same thought same question in eye for plant to grow there must be air however attenuated air that also must be able to breathe manhole said yes said cavor if be air see in little while said plant will be a high a be suppose suppose after be certain how do know stuff be air may be nitrogen may be carbonic acid even be easy said set about proving produced big piece of crumpled paper from bale lit thrust hastily through manhole valve bent forward peered down through thick glass for appearance outside little flame on whose evidence depended so much saw paper drop out lie lightly upon snow pink flame of burning vanished for instant seemed to be extinguished then saw little blue tongue upon edge of trembled crept spread quietly whole sheet save where lay in immediate contact with snow charred shrivelled sent up quivering thread of smoke there be doubt left to atmosphere of moon be pure oxygen air capable therefore unless tenuity be excessive of supporting alien life might emerge live sat down with leg on side of manhole prepared to unscrew cavor stopped there be first little precaution said pointed out that although be certainly oxygenated atmosphere outside might still be so rarified a to cause grave injury reminded of mountain sickness of bleeding often afflicts aeronaut who have ascended too swiftly spent time in preparation of sickly tasting drink insisted on sharing made feel little numb otherwise have effect on then permitted to begin unscrewing presently glass stopper of manhole be so far undone that denser air within sphere began to escape along thread of screw singing a kettle sings before boil thereupon made desist speedily became evident that pressure outside be very much le than be within how much le be have mean of telling sat grasping stopper with hand ready to close again if in spite of intense hope lunar atmosphere must after prove too rarified for cavor sat with cylinder of compressed oxygen at hand to restore pressure looked at one in silence then at fantastic vegetation that swayed grew visibly noiselessly without ever shrill piping continued blood vessel began to throb in ear sound of cavors movement diminished noted how still everything have become because of thinning of air a air sizzled out from screw moisture of condensed in little puff presently experienced peculiar shortness of breath lasted indeed during whole of time of exposure to moon exterior atmosphere rather unpleasant sensation about ear finger nail back of throat grew upon attention presently passed off again then came vertigo nausea abruptly changed quality of courage gave lid of manhole half turn made hasty explanation to cavor now be more sanguine answered in voice seemed extraordinarily small remote because of thinness of air carried sound recommended nip of brandy set example presently felt better turned manhole stopper back again throbbing in ear grew louder then remarked that piping note of outrush have ceased for time must not be sure that have ceased well said cavor in ghost of voice well said will go on thought be if can stand by way of answer went on unscrewing lifted circular operculum from place laid carefully on bale flake so of snow whirled vanished a thin unfamiliar air took possession of sphere knelt then seated at edge of manhole peering over beneath within yard of face lay untrodden snow of moon there came little pause eye met doesnt distress lung too much said cavor said can stand stretched out hand for blanket thrust head through central hole wrapped about sat down on edge of manhole let foot drop until be within six inch of lunar ground hesitated for moment then thrust forward dropped intervening inch stood upon untrodden soil of moon a stepped forward be refracted grotesquely by edge of glass stood for moment looking way that then drew together leapt glass distorted everything seemed to even then to be extremely big leap have at one bound become remote seemed twenty thirty foot off be standing high upon rocky mass gesticulating back to perhaps be shouting sound did not reach how deuce have done felt like man who have just seen new conjuring trick in puzzled state of mind too dropped through manhole stood up just in front of snowdrift have fallen away made sort of ditch made step jumped found flying through air saw rock on stood coming to meet clutched clung in state of infinite amazement gasped painful laugh be tremendously confused cavor bent down shouted in piping tone for to be careful have forgotten that on moon with only eighth part of earth mass quarter of diameter weight be barely sixth what be on earth now that fact insisted on being remembered be out of mother earth leading string now said with guarded effort raised to top moving a cautiously a rheumatic patient stood up beside under blaze of sun sphere lay behind on dwindling snowdrift thirty foot away a far a eye must see over enormous disorder of rock formed crater floor same bristling scrub surrounded be starting into life diversified here there by bulging mass of cactus form scarlet purple lichen grew so fast seemed to crawl over rock whole area of crater seemed to then to be one similar wilderness up to very foot of surrounding cliff cliff be apparently bare of vegetation save at base with buttress terrace platform did not very greatly attract attention at time be many mile away from in direction seemed to be almost at centre of crater saw through certain haziness drove before wind for there be even wind now in thin air swift yet weak wind chilled exceedingly exerted little pressure be blowing round crater a seemed to hot illuminated side from foggy darkness under sunward wall be difficult to look into eastward fog have to peer with half closed eye beneath shade of hand because of fierce intensity of motionless sun seems to be deserted said cavor absolutely desolate looked about again retained even then clinging hope of quasi human evidence pinnacle of building house engine everywhere one looked spread tumbled rock in peak crest darting scrub bulging cactus swelled swelled flat negation a seemed of such hope look a though plant have to said see trace of other creature insect bird not trace not scrap particle of animal life if there be what must do in night there just plant alone shaded eye with hand like landscape of dream thing be le like earthly land plant than thing one imago among rock at bottom of sea look at yonder one might imagine lizard changed into plant glare be only fresh morning said cavor sighed looked about be world for men said yet in way appeal became silent for time then commenced meditative humming started at gentle touch found thin sheet of livid lichen lapping over shoe kicked at fell to powder speck began to grow heard cavor exclaim sharply perceived that one of fixed bayonet of scrub have pricked hesitated eye sought among rock about sudden blaze of pink have crept up ragged pillar of crag be most extraordinary pink livid magenta look said turning behold cavor have vanished for instant stood transfixed then made hasty step to look over verge of rock in surprise at disappearance forgot once more that be on moon thrust of foot that made in striding must have carried yard on earth on moon carried six good five yard over edge for moment thing have something of effect of nightmare when one fall fall for while one fall sixteen foot in first second of fall on earth on moon one fall two with only sixth of one weight fell rather jumped down about ten yard suppose seemed to take quite long time five six second must think floated through air fell like feather knee deep in snowdrift in bottom of gully of blue grey white veined rock looked about cavor cried cavor be visible cavor cried louder rock echoed turned fiercely to rock clambered to summit of cavor cried voice sounded like voice of lost lamb sphere too be not in sight for moment horrible feeling of desolation pinched heart then saw be laughing gesticulating to attract attention be on bare patch of rock twenty thirty yard away must not hear voice jump said gesture hesitated distance seemed enormous yet reflected that surely must be able to clear greater distance than cavor made step back gathered together leapt with might seemed to shoot right up in air a though must never come down be horrible delightful a wild a nightmare to go flying off in fashion realised leap have be altogether too violent flew clean over cavors head beheld spiky confusion in gully spreading to meet fall gave yelp of alarm put out hand straightened leg illustration realised leap have be too violent hit huge fungoid bulk that burst about scattering mass of orange spore in direction covering with orange powder rolled over spluttering came to rest convulsed with breathless laughter became aware of cavors little round face peering over bristling hedge shouted faded inquiry eh tried to shout must not do so for want of breath made way towards coming gingerly among bush weve got to be careful said moon have discipline shell let smash helped to foot exerted too much said dabbing at yellow stuff with hand to remove from garment stood passive panting allowing to beat off jelly from knee elbow lecture upon misfortune dont quite allow for gravitation muscle be scarcely educated yet must practise little when have got breath pulled two three little thorn out of hand sat for time on boulder of rock muscle be quivering have that feeling of personal disillusionment come at first fall to learner of cycling on earth suddenly occurred to cavor that cold air in gully after brightness of sun might give fever so clambered back into sunlight found that beyond few abrasion have received no serious injury from tumble at cavors suggestion be presently looking round for safe easy landing place for next leap chose rocky slab ten yard off separated from by little thicket of olive green spike imagine there said cavor who be assuming air of trainer pointed to spot about four foot from toe leap managed without difficulty must confess found certain satisfaction in cavors falling short by foot so tasting spike of scrub one have to be careful see said pulling out thorn with ceased to be mentor became fellow learner in art of lunar locomotion chose still easier jump did without difficulty then leapt back again to fro several time accustoming muscle to new standard must never have believed have not experienced how rapid adaptation must be in very little time indeed certainly after fewer than thirty leap must judge effort necessary for distance with almost terrestrial assurance time lunar plant be growing around higher denser more entangled moment thicker taller spiked plant green cactus mass fungi fleshy lichenous thing strangest radiate sinuous shape be so intent upon leaping that for time gave heed to unfaltering expansion extraordinary elation have taken possession of partly think be sense of release from confinement of sphere mainly however thin sweetness of air be certain contained much larger proportion of oxygen than terrestrial atmosphere in spite of strange quality of about felt a adventurous experimental a cockney must do placed for first time among mountain think occurred to of face to face though be with unknown to be very greatly afraid be bitten by spirit of enterprise selected lichenous kopje perhaps fifteen yard away landed neatly on summit one after other good cried to other good cavor made three step went off to tempting slope of snow good twenty yard more beyond stood for moment struck by grotesque effect of soaring figure dirty cricket cap spiky hair little round body arm knickerbockered leg tucked up tightly against weird spaciousness of lunar scene gust of laughter seized then stepped off to follow plump dropped beside made few gargantuan stride leapt three four time more sat down at last in lichenous hollow lung be painful sat holding side recovering breath looking appreciation at one cavor panted something about amazing sensation then came thought into head for moment did not seem particularly appalling thought simply natural question arising out of situation by way said where exactly be sphere cavor looked at eh full meaning of what be saying struck sharply cavor cried laying hand on arm where be sphere x lost men in moon face caught something of dismay stood up stared about at scrub fenced in rose about straining upward in passion of growth put dubious hand to lip spoke with sudden lack of assurance think said slowly left somewhere about there pointed hesitating finger wavered in arc im not sure look of consternation deepened anyhow said with eye on cant be far have stood up made unmeaning ejaculation eye sought in twining thickening jungle round about about on sunlit slope frothed swayed darting shrub swelling cactus creeping lichen wherever shade remained snowdrift lingered north south east west spread identical monotony of unfamiliar form somewhere buried already among tangled confusion be sphere home only provision only hope of escape from fantastic wilderness of ephemeral growth into have come think after said pointing suddenly might be over there said have turned in curve see here be mark of heel clear thing must be more to eastward much more no sphere must be over there think said cavor kept sun upon right time leap seems to said shadow flew before stared into one anothers eye area of crater have become enormously vast to imagination growing thicket already impenetrably dense good heaven what fool have be evident that must find again said cavor soon sun grows stronger must be fainting with heat already if wasnt so dry im hungry stared at have not suspected aspect of matter before came to at once positive craving yes said with emphasis be hungry too stood up with look of active resolution certainly must find sphere a calmly a possible surveyed interminable reef thicket formed floor of crater of weighing in silence chance of finding sphere before be overtaken by heat hunger cant be fifty yard from here said cavor with indecisive gesture only thing be to beat round about until come upon be can do said without alacrity to begin hunt wish confounded spike bush did not grow so fast thats just said cavor be lying on bank of snow stared about in vain hope of recognising knoll shrub have be near sphere everywhere be confusing sameness everywhere aspiring bush distending fungi dwindling snow bank steadily inevitably changed sun scorched stung faintness of unaccountable hunger mingled with infinite perplexity even a stood there confused lost amidst unprecedented thing became aware for first time of sound upon moon other than stir of growing plant faint sighing of wind that have made boom boom boom came from beneath foot sound in earth seemed to hear with foot a much a with ear dull resonance be muffled by distance thick with quality of intervening substance sound can imagine must have astonished more have changed more completely quality of thing about for sound rich slow deliberate seemed to a though must be nothing striking of gigantic buried clock boom boom boom sound suggestive of still cloister of sleepless night in crowded city of vigil awaited hour of be orderly methodical in life booming out pregnant mysterious in fantastic desert to eye everything be unchanged desolation of bush cactus waving silently in wind stretched unbroken to distant cliff still dark sky be empty overhead hot sun hung burned through warning threat throbbed enigma of sound boom boom boom questioned one in faint faded voice clock like clock what be can be count be cavors belated suggestion at word striking ceased silence rhythmic disappointment of silence came a fresh shock for moment one must doubt whether one have ever heard sound whether might not still be going on have indeed heard sound felt pressure of cavors hand upon arm spoke in undertone a though feared to wake sleeping thing let keep together whispered look for sphere must get back to sphere be beyond understanding way will go hesitated intense persuasion of presence of unseen thing about near dominated mind what must be where must be be arid desolation alternately frozen scorched only outer rind mask of subterranean world if so what sort of world what sort of inhabitant might not presently disgorge upon then stabbing aching stillness a vivid sudden a unexpected thunderclap came clang rattle a though great gate of metal have suddenly be flung apart arrested step stood gaping helplessly then cavor stole towards understand whispered close to face waved hand vaguely skyward vague suggestion of still vaguer thought hiding place if anything came looked about nodded head in assent to started off moving stealthily with most exaggerated precaution against noise went towards thicket of scrub clangour like hammer flung about boiler hastened step must crawl whispered cavor lower leaf of bayonet plant already overshadowed by newer one above be beginning to wilt shrivel so that must thrust way in among thickening stem without serious injury stab in face arm did not heed at heart of thicket stopped stared panting into cavors face subterranean whispered below may come out must find sphere yes said how crawl till come to if dont keep hidden see what be like will keep together said thought way will go must take chance peered way that then very circumspectly began to crawl through lower jungle making so far a must judge circuit halting now at waving fungus at sound intent only on sphere from have so foolishly emerged ever again from out of earth beneath came concussion beating strange inexplicable mechanical sound once then again thought heard something faint rattle tumult borne to through air fearful a be dared essay vantage point to survey crater for long saw nothing of being whose sound be so abundant insistent for faintness of hunger drying of throat that crawling must have have quality of very vivid dream be so absolutely unreal only element with touch of reality be sound figure to yourself about dreamlike jungle with silent bayonet leaf darting overhead silent vivid sun splashed lichen under hand knee waving with vigour of growth a carpet wave when wind get beneath ever again one of bladder fungi bulging distending under sun loomed upon ever again novel shape in vivid colour obtruded very cell that built up plant be a large a thumb like bead of coloured glass thing be saturated in unmitigated glare of sun be seen against sky be bluish black spangled still in spite of sunlight with few surviving star strange very form texture of stone be strange be strange feeling of one body be unprecedented other movement ended in surprise breath sucked thin in one throat blood flowed through one ear in throbbing tide thud thud thud thud ever again came gust of turmoil hammering clanging throb of machinery presently bellowing of great beast xi mooncalf pasture so two poor terrestrial castaway lost in wild growing moon jungle crawled in terror before sound have come upon crawled a seemed long time before saw selenite mooncalf though heard bellowing gruntulous noise of latter continually drawing nearer to crawled through stony ravine over snow slope amidst fungi ripped like thin bladder at thrust emitting watery humour over perfect pavement of thing like puff ball beneath interminable thicket of scrub ever more hopelessly eye sought for abandoned sphere noise of mooncalves must at time be vast flat calf like sound at time rose to amazed wrathy bellowing again must become clogged bestial sound a though unseen creature have sought to eat bellow at same time first view be inadequate transitory glimpse yet none le disturbing because be incomplete cavor be crawling in front at time first be aware of proximity stopped dead arresting with single gesture crackling smashing of scrub appeared to be advancing directly upon then a squatted close endeavoured to judge of nearness direction of noise there came terrific bellow behind so close vehement that top of bayonet scrub bent before one felt breath of hot moist turning about saw indistinctly through crowd of swaying stem mooncalfs shining side long line of back loomed out against sky of course be hard for now to say how much saw at time because impression be corrected by subsequent observation first of impression be enormous size girth of body be fourscore foot length perhaps two hundred side rose fell with laboured breathing perceived that gigantic flabby body lay along ground that skin be of corrugated white dappling into blackness along backbone of foot saw nothing think also that saw then profile at least of almost brainless head with fat encumbered slobbering omnivorous mouth little nostril tight shut eye for mooncalf invariably shuts eye in presence of sun have glimpse of vast red pit a opened mouth to bleat bellow again have breath from pit then monster heeled over like ship dragged forward along ground creasing leathery skin rolled again so wallowed past smashing path amidst scrub be speedily hidden from eye by dense interlacings beyond appeared more distantly then then a though be guiding animated lump of provender to pasture selenite came momentarily into ken grip upon cavors foot became convulsive at sight of remained motionless peering long after have passed out of range by contrast with mooncalves seemed trivial being mere ant scarcely five foot high be wearing garment of leathery substance so that portion of actual body appeared of of course be entirely ignorant presented therefore a compact bristling creature having much of quality of complicated insect with whip like tentacle clanging arm projecting from shining cylindrical body case form of head be hidden by enormous many spiked helmet discovered afterwards that used spike for prodding refractory mooncalves pair of goggles of darkened glass set very much at side gave bird like quality to metallic apparatus covered face arm did not project beyond body case carried upon short leg wrapped though be in warm covering seemed to terrestrial eye inordinately flimsy have very short thigh very long shank little foot in spite of heavy looking clothing be progressing with what must be from terrestrial point of view very considerable stride clanging arm be busy quality of motion during instant of passing suggested haste certain anger soon after have lost sight of heard bellow of mooncalf change abruptly into short sharp squeal followed by scuffle of acceleration gradually that bellowing receded then came to end a if pasture sought have be attained listened for space moon world be still be time before resumed crawling search for vanished sphere when next saw mooncalves be little distance away from in place of tumbled rock le vertical surface of rock be thick with speckled green plant growing in dense mossy clump upon creature be browsing stopped at edge of reed amidst be crawling at sight of peering out at looking round for second glimpse of selenite lay against food like stupendous slug huge greasy hull eating greedily noisily with sort of sobbing avidity seemed monster of mere fatness clumsy overwhelmed to degree must make smithfield ox seem model of agility busy writhing chewing mouth eye closed together with appetising sound of munching made up effect of animal enjoyment be singularly stimulating to empty frame hog said cavor with unusual passion disgusting hog after one glare of angry envy crawled off through bush to right stayed long enough to see that speckled plant be quite hopeless for human nourishment then crawled after nibbling quill of between teeth presently be arrested again by proximity of selenite time be able to observe more exactly now must see that selenite covering be indeed clothing not sort of crustacean integument be quite similar in costume to former one have glimpsed except end of something like wadding be protruding from neck stood on promontory of rock moved head way that a though be surveying crater lay quite still fearing to attract attention if moved after time turned about disappeared came upon drove of mooncalves bellowing up ravine then passed over place of sound sound of beating machinery a if huge hall of industry came near surface there while sound be still about came to edge of great open space perhaps two hundred yard in diameter perfectly level save for few lichen advanced from margin space be bare presented powdery surface of dusty yellow colour be afraid to strike out across space a presented le obstruction to crawling than scrub went down upon began very circumspectly to skirt edge for little while noise from below ceased everything save for faint stir of growing vegetation be very still then abruptly there began uproar louder more vehement nearer than have so far heard of certainty came from below instinctively crouched a flat a must ready for prompt plunge into thicket beside knock throb seemed to vibrate through body louder grew throbbing beating that irregular vibration increased until whole moon world seemed to be jerking pulsing cover whispered cavor turned towards bush at instant came thud like thud of gun then thing happened still haunt in dream have turned head to look at cavors face thrust out hand in front of a did so hand met nothing plunged suddenly into bottomless hole chest hit something hard found with chin on edge of unfathomable abyss have suddenly opened beneath hand extended stiffly into void whole of flat circular area be more than gigantic lid be now sliding sideways from off pit have covered into slot prepared for have not be for cavor think must have remained rigid hanging over margin staring into enormous gulf below until at last edge of slot scraped off hurled into depth cavor have not received shock have paralysed have be little distance from edge when lid have first opened perceiving peril held helpless gripped leg pulled backward came into sitting position crawled away from edge for space on four then staggered up ran after across thundering quivering sheet of metal seemed to be swinging open with steadily accelerated velocity bush in front of shifted sideways a ran be none too soon cavors back vanished amidst bristling thicket a scrambled up after monstrous valve came into position with clang for long time lay panting not daring to approach pit at last very cautiously bit by bit crept into position from must peer down bush about creaked waved with force of breeze be blowing down shaft must see nothing at first except smooth vertical wall descending at last into impenetrable black then very gradually became aware of number of very faint little light going to fro for time stupendous gulf of mystery held so that forgot even sphere in time a grew more accustomed to darkness must make out very small dim elusive shape moving about among needle point illumination peered amazed incredulous understanding so little that must find word to say must distinguish nothing must give clue to meaning of faint shape saw what can be asked what can be engineering must live in cavern during night come out during day cavor said can be that be something like men be not man dare risk nothing dare hing until find sphere can hing until find sphere assented with groan stirred to move stared about for space sighed indicated direction struck out through jungle for time crawled resolutely then with diminishing vigour presently among great shape of flabby purple there came noise of trampling cry about lay close for long time sound went to fro very near time saw nothing tried to whisper to cavor must hardly go without food much longer mouth have become too dry for whispering cavor said must have food turned face full of dismay towards case for holding out said must said look at lip ive be thirsty time if only of snow have remained clean gone be driving from arctic to tropical at rate of degree minute gnawed hand sphere said there be nothing for sphere roused to spurt of crawling mind ran entirely on edible thing on hissing profundity of summer drink more particularly craved for beer be haunted by memory of sixteen gallon cask have swaggered in lympne cellar thought of adjacent larder especially of steak kidney pie tender steak plenty of kidney rich thick gravy between ever again be seized with fit of hungry yawning came to flat place overgrown with fleshy red thing monstrous coralline growth a pushed against snapped broke noted quality of broken surface confounded stuff certainly looked of biteable texture then seemed to that smelt rather well picked up fragment sniffed at cavor said in hoarse undertone glanced at with face screwed up dont said put down fragment crawled on through tempting fleshiness for space cavor asked why not poison heard say did not look round crawled way before decided ill chance said made belated gesture to prevent stuffed mouth full crouched watching face own twisted into oddest expression good said o lord cried watched munch face wrinkled between desire disapproval then suddenly succumbed to appetite began to tear off huge mouthful for time did nothing eat stuff be not unlike terrestrial mushroom only be much laxer in texture a one swallowed warmed throat at first experienced mere mechanical satisfaction in eating then blood began to run warmer tingled at lip finger then new slightly irrelevant idea came bubbling up in mind good said infernally good what home for surplus population poor surplus population broke off large portion filled with curiously benevolent satisfaction that there be such good food in moon depression of hunger gave way to irrational exhilaration dread discomfort in have be living vanished entirely perceived moon no longer a planet from most earnestly desired mean of escape a possible refuge for human destitution think forgot selenites mooncalves lid noise completely so soon a have eaten that fungus cavor replied to third repetition of surplus population remark with similar word of approval felt that head swam put down to stimulating effect of food after long fast esslent discovry yours cavor said send ony to tato whajer mean asked cavor scovery of moon send ony to tato looked at shocked at suddenly hoarse voice by badness of articulation occurred to in flash that be intoxicated possibly by fungus also occurred to that erred in imagining that have discovered moon have not discovered have only reached tried to lay hand on arm explain to issue be too subtle for brain be also unexpectedly difficult to express after momentary attempt to understand remember wondering if fungus have made eye a fishy a set off upon observation on own account be announced with solemn hiccup creashurs o what eat drink repeated a be now in one of subtle mood determined to dispute possibly wandered little from point cavor certainly did not attend at properly stood up a well a must putting hand on head to steady be disrespectful stood staring about quite devoid now of fear of moon being tried to point out that be dangerous for reason be not perfectly clear to word dangerous have somehow got mixed with indiscreet came out rather more like injurious than after attempt to disentangle resumed argument addressing principally to unfamiliar attentive coralline growth on side felt that be necessary to clear up confusion between moon potato at once wandered into long parenthesis on importance of precision of definition in argument did best to ignore fact that bodily sensation be no longer agreeable in way have now forgotten mind be led back to project of colonisation must annex moon said there must be shilly willy be part of white man burthen cavor be hic satap mean satrap nempire csar never dreamt bin newspaper cavorecia bedfordecia bedfordecia hic limited mean unlimited practically certainly be intoxicated embarked upon argument to show infinite benefit arrival must confer on moon involved in rather difficult proof that arrival of columbus be on whole beneficial to america found have forgotten line of argument have intended to pursue continued to repeat simlar to clumbus to fill up time from point memory of action of abominable fungus becomes confused remember vaguely that declared intention of standing nonsense from confounded insect that decided ill became men to hide shamefully upon mere satellite that equipped with huge armful of fungus whether for missile purpose not know heedless of stab of bayonet scrub started forth into sunshine almost immediately must have come upon selenites there be six of be marching in single file over rocky place making most remarkable piping whining sound seemed to become aware of at once instantly became silent motionless like animal with face turned towards for moment be sobered insect murmured cavor insect think im going to crawl about on stomach on vertebrated stomach stomach repeated slowly a though chewed indignity illustration insect murmured cavor insect then suddenly with shout of fury made three vast stride leapt towards leapt badly made series of somersault in air whirled right over vanished with enormous splash amidst cactus bladder what selenites made of amazing to mind undignified irruption from planet have mean of guessing seem to remember sight of back a ran in direction be not sure last incident before oblivion came be vague faint in mind know made step to follow cavor tripped fell headlong among rock be be certain suddenly vehemently ill seem to remember violent struggle being gripped by metallic clasp next clear recollection be that be prisoner at knew not what depth beneath moon surface be in darkness amidst strange distracting noise body be covered with scratch bruise head racked with pain xii selenites face found sitting crouched together in tumultuous darkness for long time must not understand where be how have come to perplexity thought of cupboard into have be thrust at time when be child then of very dark noisy bedroom in have slept during illness sound about be not noise have known there be thin flavour in air like wind of stable then supposed must still be at work upon sphere that somehow have got into cellar of cavors house remembered have finished sphere fancied must still be in travelling through space cavor said can not have light there came answer cavor insisted be answered by groan head heard say head attempted to press hand to brow ached discovered be tied together startled very much brought up to mouth felt cold smoothness of metal be chained together tried to separate leg made out be similarly fastened also be fastened to ground by much thicker chain about middle of body be more frightened than have be by anything in strange experience for time tugged silently at bond cavor cried out sharply why be tied why have tied hand foot havent tied answered selenites selenites mind hung on for space then memory came back to snowy desolation thawing of air growth of plant strange hopping crawling among rock vegetation of crater distress of frantic search for sphere returned to finally opening of great lid covered pit then a strained to trace later movement down to present plight pain in head became intolerable came to insurmountable barrier obstinate blank cavor yes where be how must know be dead what nonsense theyve got then made answer grunt lingering trace of poison seemed to make oddly irritable what do mean to do how must know what to do oh very well said became silent presently be roused from stupor o lord cried wish youd stop that buzzing lapsed into silence again listening to dull confusion of noise like muffled sound of street factory filled ear must make nothing of mind pursued first one rhythm then questioned in vain after long time became aware of new sharper element not mingling with rest standing out a be against cloudy background of sound be series of relatively very little definite sound tapping rubbing like loose spray of ivy against window bird moving about upon box listened peered about darkness be velvet pall there followed noise like subtle movement of ward of well oiled lock then there appeared before hanging a seemed in immensity of black thin bright line look whispered cavor very softly what be dont know stared thin bright line became band broader paler took upon quality of bluish light falling upon whitewashed wall ceased to be parallel sided developed deep indentation on one side turned to remark to cavor be amazed to see ear in brilliant illumination rest of in shadow twisted head round a well a bond must permit cavor said behind ear vanished gave place to eye suddenly crack have be admitting light broadened out revealed a space of opening door beyond be sapphire vista in doorway stood grotesque outline silhouetted against glare made convulsive effort to turn failing sat staring over shoulder at first impression be of clumsy quadruped with lowered head then perceived be slender pinched body short extremely attenuated bandy leg of selenite with head depressed between shoulder be without helmet body covering wear upon exterior be blank black figure to instinctively imagination supplied feature to very human outline at least took instantly that be somewhat hunchbacked with high forehead long feature came forward three step paused for time movement seemed absolutely noiseless then came forward again walked like bird foot fell one in front of other stepped out of ray of light came through doorway seemed a though vanished altogether in shadow for moment eye sought in wrong place then perceived standing facing in full light only human feature have attributed to be not there at of course ought to have expected that only didnt came to a absolute for moment overwhelming shock seemed a though wasnt face a though must need be mask horror deformity must presently be disavowed explained there be nose thing have dull bulging eye at side in silhouette have supposed be ear there be ear have tried to draw one of head can not there be mouth downwardly curved like human mouth in face stare ferociously neck on head be poised be jointed in three place almost like short joint in leg of crab joint of limb must not see because of puttee like strap in be swathed formed only clothing being wore there thing be looking at illustration there thing be looking at at time mind be taken up by mad impossibility of creature suppose also be amazed with more reason perhaps for amazement than only confound did not show did at least know what have brought about meeting of incompatible creature conceive how must seem to decent londoner for example to come upon couple of living thing a big a men absolutely unlike other earthly animal careering about among sheep in hyde park must have taken like figure be bound hand foot fagged filthy beard two inch long face scratched bloody cavor must imagine in knickerbockers torn in several place by bayonet scrub jaeger shirt old cricket cap wiry hair wildly disordered tail to quarter of heaven in blue light face did not look red very dark lip drying blood upon hand seemed black if possible be in worse plight than on account of yellow fungus into have jumped jacket be unbuttoned shoe have be taken off lay at foot be sitting with back to queer bluish light peering at monster a drer might have invented cavor broke silence started to speak went hoarse cleared throat outside began terrific bellowing a if mooncalf be in trouble ended in shriek everything be still again presently selenite turned about flickered into shadow stood for moment retrospective at door then closed on once more be in murmurous mystery of darkness into have awakened xiii mr cavor make suggestion for time neither of spoke to focus together thing have brought upon ourselves seemed beyond mental power theyve got said at last be that fungus well if hadnt taken must have fainted starved might have found sphere lost temper at persistence swore to myself for time hated one in silence drummed with finger on floor between knee gritted link of fetter together presently be forced to talk again what do make of anyhow asked humbly be reasonable creature can make thing do thing light saw stopped be clear must make nothing of when spoke again be to confess after be more human than have right to expect suppose stopped irritatingly yes suppose anyhow on planet where there be intelligent animal will carry brain case upward have hand walk erect presently broke away in direction be way in said mean perhaps couple of thousand foot more why cooler voice be so much louder faded quality have altogether gone feeling in one ear throat have not noted that did now air be denser must be depth mile even may be inside moon never thought of world inside moon how must might have done only one get into habit of mind thought for time now said seems such obvious thing of course moon must be enormously cavernous with atmosphere within at centre of cavern sea one knew that moon have lower specific gravity than earth one knew that have little air water outside one knew too that be sister planet to earth that be unaccountable that must be different in composition inference that be hollowed out be a clear a day yet one never saw a fact kepler of course voice have interest now of man who have discovered pretty sequence of reasoning yes said kepler with sub volvani be right after wish have taken trouble to find out before came said answered nothing buzzing to softly a pursued thought temper be going what do think have become of sphere anyhow asked said like man who answer uninteresting question among plant unless find then how can tell cavor said with sort of hysterical bitterness thing look bright for company made answer good lord exclaimed just think of trouble took to get into pickle what did come for what be after what be moon to to moon wanted too much tried too much ought to have started little thing first be proposed moon cavorite spring blind be certain must have worked for terrestrial purpose certain did really understand what proposed steel cylinder rubbish said cavor ceased to converse for time cavor kept up broken monologue without much help from if find began if find what will do with well thats question may be thats question wont understand anyhow if understood sort of thing must have come long since to earth must why shouldnt must have sent something couldnt keep hand off possibility will examine clearly be intelligent inquisitive will examine get inside trifle with stud off must mean moon for for rest of life strange creature strange knowledge a for strange knowledge said language failed look here bedford said cavor came on expedition of own free will said to call prospecting there always risk in prospecting especially when do unarmed without thinking out possibility be so taken up with sphere thing rushed on carried away rushed on mean rushed on just a much how be to know when set to work on molecular physic that business must bring here of place accursed science cried very devil medival priest persecutor be right modern be wrong tamper with offer gift directly take knock to piece in unexpected way old passion new weapon now upset religion now upset social idea now whirl off to desolation misery anyhow use quarrelling with now creature selenites choose to call have got tied hand foot temper choose to go through with in will have to go through with have experience before will need coolness paused a if required assent sat sulking confound science said problem be communication gesture fear will be different pointing for example creature men monkey point be too obviously wrong for pretty nearly animal cried point with eye nose cavor meditated over yes said at last dont there such difference such difference one might how can tell there be sound make sort of fluting piping dont see how be to imitate be speech that sort of thing may have different sens different mean of communication of course be mind be mind there must be something in common who know how far may not get to understanding thing be outside said theyre more different from than strangest animal on earth be different clay what be good of talking like cavor thought dont see that where there be mind will have something similar even though have be evolved on different planet of course if be question of instinct if be more than animal well be theyre much more like ant on hind leg than human being who ever got to sort of understanding with ant machine clothing dont hold with bedford difference be wide insurmountable resemblance must bridge remember reading once paper by late professor galton on possibility of communication between planet unhappily at time did not seem probable that must be of material benefit to fear did not give attention must have done in view of state of affair yet now let see idea be to begin with broad truth must underlie conceivable mental existence establish basis on great principle of geometry to begin with proposed to take leading proposition of euclid show by construction that truth be known to to demonstrate for example that angle at base of isosceles be equal that if equal side be produced angle on other side of base be equal also that square on hypotenuse of right angled triangle be equal to sum of square on two other side by demonstrating knowledge of thing must demonstrate possession of reasonable intelligence now suppose might draw geometrical figure with wet finger even trace in air fell silent sat meditating word for time wild hope of communication of interpretation with weird being held then that angry despair be part of exhaustion physical misery resumed sway perceived with sudden novel vividness extraordinary folly of everything have ever done as said oh as unutterable as seem to exist only to go about doing preposterous thing why did ever leave thing hopping about looking for patent concession in crater of moon if only have have sense to fasten handkerchief to stick to show where have left sphere subsided fuming be clear meditated cavor be intelligent one can hypotheticate certain thing a have not killed at once must have idea of mercy mercy at rate of restraint possibly of intercourse may meet apartment glimpse have of guardian fetter high degree of intelligence wish to heaven cried id thought even twice plunge after plunge first one fluky start then be confidence in why didnt stick to play be what be equal to be world life be made for must have finished that play im certain be good play have scenario a good a done then conceive leaping to moon practically ive thrown life away that old woman in inn near canterbury have better sense looked up stopped in mid sentence darkness have given place to bluish light again door be opening several noiseless selenites be coming into chamber became quite still staring at grotesque face then suddenly sense of disagreeable strangeness changed to interest perceived that foremost second carried bowl one elemental need at least mind must understand in common be bowl of metal that like fetter looked dark in bluish light contained number of whitish fragment cloudy pain misery that oppressed rushed together took shape of hunger eyed bowl wolfishly though returned to in dream at time seemed small matter at end of arm lowered one towards be not hand sort of flap thumb like end of elephant trunk stuff in bowl be loose in texture whitish brown in colour rather like lump of cold souffl smelt faintly like mushroom from partially divided carcass of mooncalf that presently saw be inclined to believe must have be mooncalf flesh hand be so tightly chained that must barely contrive to reach bowl when saw effort made two of dexterously released one of turn about wrist tentacle hand be soft cold to skin immediately seized mouthful of food have same laxness in texture that organic structure seem to have upon moon tasted rather like gauffre damp meringue in way be disagreeable took two other mouthful wanted foo said tearing off still larger piece for time ate with utter absence of self consciousness ate presently drank like tramp in soup kitchen never before since have be hungry to ravenous pitch save have have very experience must never have believed that quarter of million of mile out of proper world in utter perplexity of soul surrounded watched touched by being more grotesque inhuman than worst creation of nightmare must be possible for to eat in utter forgetfulness of thing stood about watching ever again making slight elusive twittering stood suppose in stead of speech did not even shiver at touch when first zeal of feeding be over must note that cavor too have be eating with same shameless abandon xiv experiment in intercourse when at last have made end of eating selenites linked hand closely together again then untwisted chain about foot rebound so a to give limited freedom of movement then unfastened chain about waist to do have to handle freely ever again one of queer head came down close to face soft tentacle hand touched head neck dont remember be afraid then repelled by proximity think that incurable anthropomorphism made imagine there be human head inside mask skin like everything else looked bluish be on account of light be hard shiny quite in beetle wing fashion not soft moist hairy a vertebrated animal must be along crest of head be low ridge of whitish spine running from back to front much larger ridge curved on side over eye selenite who untied used mouth to help hand seem to be releasing said cavor remember be on moon make sudden movement be going to try geometry if get chance of course may make advance first remained passive selenites having finished arrangement stood back from seemed to be looking at say seemed to be because a eye be at side not in front one have same difficulty in determining direction in be looking a one have in case of hen fish conversed with one in reedy tone seemed to impossible to imitate define door behind opened wider glancing over shoulder saw vague large space beyond in little crowd of selenites be standing seemed curiously miscellaneous rabble do want to imitate sound asked cavor dont think so said seems to that be trying to make understand something cant make anything of gesture do notice one who be worrying with head like man with uncomfortable collar let shake head at did finding ineffectual attempted imitation of selenites movement seemed to interest at rate set up same movement a seemed to lead to nothing desisted at last so did fell into piping argument among then one of shorter very much thicker than others with particularly wide mouth squatted down suddenly beside cavor put hand foot in same posture a cavors be bound then by dexterous movement stood up cavor shouted want to get up stared open mouthed thats said with much heaving grunting because hand be tied together contrived to struggle to foot selenites made way for elephantine heaving seemed to twitter more volubly a soon a be on foot thick set selenite came patted of face with tentacle walked towards open doorway that also be plain enough followed saw that four of selenites standing in doorway be much taller than others clothed in same manner a have seen in crater namely with spiked round helmet cylindrical body case that of four carried goad with spike guard made of same dull looking metal a bowl four closed about one on side of of a emerged from chamber into cavern from light have come did not get impression of cavern at once attention be taken up by movement attitude of selenites immediately about by necessity of controlling motion lest must startle alarm by excessive stride in front of be short thick set being who have solved problem of asking to get up moving with gesture seemed almost of intelligible to inviting to follow spout like face turned from one of to other with quickness be clearly interrogative for time say be taken up with thing at last great place formed background to movement asserted became apparent that source of much at least of tumult of sound have filled ear ever since have recovered from stupefaction of fungus be vast mass of machinery in active movement whose flying whirling part be visible indistinctly over head between body of selenites who walked about not only did web of sound filled air proceed from mechanism also peculiar blue light irradiated whole place have taken a natural thing that subterranean cavern must be artificially lit even now though fact be patent to eye did not really grasp import until presently darkness came meaning structure of huge apparatus saw can not explain because of learnt what be for how worked one after big shaft of metal flung out up from centre head travelling in what seemed to to be parabolic path dropped sort of dangling arm a rose towards apex of flight plunged down into vertical cylinder forcing down before about moved shape of tender little figure seemed vaguely different from being about a of three dangling arm of machine plunged down there be clank then roaring out of top of vertical cylinder came pouring incandescent substance lit place ran over a milk run over boiling pot dripped luminously into tank of light below be cold blue light sort of phosphorescent glow infinitely brighter from tank into fell ran in conduit athwart cavern thud thud thud thud came sweeping arm of unintelligible apparatus light substance hissed poured at first thing seemed only reasonably large near to then saw how exceedingly little selenites upon seemed realised full immensity of cavern machine looked from tremendous affair to face of selenites with new respect stopped cavor stopped stared at thunderous engine be stupendous said what can be for cavors blue lit face be full of intelligent respect cant dream surely being men must not make thing like look at arm be on connecting rod thick set selenite have gone pace unheeded came back stood between great machine avoided seeing because guessed somehow that idea be to beckon onward walked away in direction wished to go turned came back flicked face to attract attention cavor looked at one can not show be interested in machine said yes said cavor well try that turned to guide smiled pointed to machine pointed again then to head then to machine by defect of reasoning seemed to imagine that broken english might help gesture look im said think im very much yes behaviour seemed to check selenites in desire for progress for moment faced one queer head moved twittering voice came quick liquid then one of lean tall creature with sort of mantle added to puttee in others be dressed twisted elephant trunk of hand about cavors waist pulled gently to follow guide who again went on ahead cavor resisted may just a well begin explaining now may think be new animal new sort of mooncalf perhaps be most important that must show intelligent interest from outset began to shake head violently no said not come on one minute look at im isnt there geometrical point might bring in apropos of affair suggested a selenites conferred again possibly parabolic began yelled loudly leaped six foot more one of four armed moon men have pricked with goad turned on goad bearer behind with swift threatening gesture started back cavors sudden shout leap clearly astonished selenites receded hastily facing for one of moment seem to last for ever stood in angry protest with scattered semicircle of inhuman being about pricked said cavor with catching of voice saw answered confound said to selenites be not going to stand what on earth do take for glanced quickly right left far away across blue wilderness of cavern saw number of other selenites running towards broad slender be one with larger head than others cavern spread wide low receded in direction into darkness roof remember seemed to bulge down a if with weight of vast thickness of rock prisoned there be way out of way out of above below in direction be unknown inhuman creature with goad gesture confronting two unsupported men xv giddy bridge just for moment that hostile pause endured suppose that selenites did very rapid thinking clearest impression be that there be nothing to put back against that be bound to be surrounded killed overwhelming folly of presence there loomed over in black enormous reproach why have ever launched on mad inhuman expedition cavor came to side laid hand on arm pale terrified face be ghastly in blue light cant do anything said mistake dont understand must go a want to go looked down at then at fresh selenites who be coming to help fellow if have hand free use panted well go turned about led way in direction have be indicated for followed trying to look a subdued a possible feeling at chain about wrist blood be boiling noted nothing more of cavern though seemed to take long time before have marched across if noted anything forgot a saw thought be concentrated think upon chain selenites particularly upon helmeted one with goad at first marched parallel with at respectful distance presently be overtaken by three others then drew nearer until be within arm length again winced like beaten horse a came near to shorter thicker selenite marched at first on right flank presently came in front of again how well picture of grouping have bitten into brain back of cavors downcast head just in front of dejected droop of shoulder guide gaping visage perpetually jerking about goad bearer on side watchful yet open mouthed blue monochrome after do remember one other thing besides purely personal affair be that sort of gutter came presently across floor of cavern then ran along by side of path of rock followed be full of same bright blue luminous stuff flowed out of great machine walked close beside can testify radiated not particle of heat be brightly shining yet be warmer colder than anything else in cavern clang clang clang passed right under thumping lever of vast machine so came at last to wide tunnel in must even hear pad pad of shoeless foot save for trickling thread of blue to right of be quite unlit shadow made gigantic travesty of shape of selenites on irregular wall roof of tunnel ever again crystal in wall of tunnel scintillated like gem ever again tunnel expanded into stalactitic cavern gave off branch that vanished into darkness seemed to be marching down tunnel for long time trickle went flowing light very softly footfall echo made irregular paddle paddle mind settled down to question of chain if be to slip off one turn so then to twist so if tried to do very gradually must see be slipping wrist out of looser turn if did what must do bedford said cavor go down keep on going down remark roused from sullen preoccupation if wanted to kill said dropping back to come level with there be reason why must not have done admitted thats true dont understand said think be merely strange animal wild sort of mooncalf birth perhaps will be only when have observed better that will begin to think have mind when trace geometrical problem said may be that tramped on for space see said cavor may be selenites of lower class infernal fool said viciously glancing at exasperating face if endure what do to weve got to endure said there may be others le stupid be mere outer fringe of world must go down down cavern passage tunnel down at last to sea hundred of mile below word made think of mile so of rock tunnel might be over head already be like weight dropping on shoulder away from sun air said even mine half mile deep be stuffy be not anyhow probable ventilation air must blow from dark side of moon to sunlit carbonic acid must well out there feed plant up tunnel for example there be quite breeze what world must be earnest have in shaft machine goad said dont forget goad walked little in front of for time even goad said well be angry at time be perhaps necessary must get on have different skin probably different nerve may not understand objection just a being from mar might not like earthly habit of nudging theyd better be careful how nudge about geometry after way be way of understanding too begin with element of life not of thought food compulsion pain strike at fundamental there doubt about said went on to talk of enormous wonderful world into be being taken realised slowly from tone that even now be not absolutely in despair at prospect of going ever deeper into inhuman planet burrow mind ran on machine invention to exclusion of thousand dark thing beset wasnt that intended to make use of thing simply wanted to know after said be tremendous occasion be meeting of two world be going to see think of what be below here shant see much if light isnt better remarked be only outer crust down below on scale there will be everything do notice how different seem one from story will take back rare sort of animal said might comfort in way while be bringing to zoo doesnt follow that be going to be shown thing when find have reasonable mind said cavor will want to learn about earth even if have generous emotion will teach in order to learn thing must know unanticipated thing went on to speculate on possibility of knowing thing have never hoped to learn on earth speculating in way with raw wound from goad already in skin much that said forget for attention be drawn to fact that tunnel along have be marching be opening out wider wider seemed from feeling of air to be going out into huge space how big space might really be must not tell because be unlit little stream of light ran in dwindling thread vanished far ahead presently rocky wall have vanished altogether on hand there be nothing to be seen path in front of trickling hurrying rivulet of blue phosphorescence figure of cavor guiding selenite marched before side of leg head be towards rivulet be clear bright blue darkened side now that reflection of tunnel wall no longer lit merged indistinguishably in darkness beyond soon perceived that be approaching declivity of sort because little blue stream dipped suddenly out of sight in moment a seemed have reached edge shining stream gave one meander of hesitation then rushed over fell to depth at sound of descent be absolutely lost to far below be bluish glow sort of blue mist at infinite distance below darkness stream dropped out of became utterly void black save that thing like plank projected from edge of cliff stretched out faded vanished altogether there be warm air blowing up out of gulf for moment cavor stood a near edge a dared peering into blue tinged profundity then guide be pulling at arm then left walked to end of plank stepped upon looking back then when perceived watched turned about went on along walking a surely a though be on firm earth for moment form be distinct then became blue blur then vanished into obscurity became aware of vague shape looming darkly out of black there be pause surely said cavor one of other selenites walked few pace out upon plank turned looked back at unconcernedly others stood ready to follow after guide expectant figure reappeared be returning to see why have not advanced what be beyond there asked cant see cant cross at price said must not go three step on said cavor even with hand free looked at others drawn face in blank consternation cant know what be to be giddy said cavor quite impossible for to walk that plank dont believe see a do ive be watching wonder if know be simply blackness for how can make understand anyhow must make understand think said thing with vague half hope selenites might somehow understand knew quite clearly that be needed be explanation then a saw face realised that explanation be impossible just here be that resemblance be not going to bridge difference well wasnt going to walk plank anyhow slipped wrist very quickly out of coil of chain be loose then began to twist wrist in opposite direction be standing nearest to bridge a did two of selenites laid hold of pulled gently towards shook head violently go said use dont understand selenite added compulsion be forced to step forward ive got idea said cavor knew idea look here exclaimed to selenites steady on very well for sprang round upon heel burst out into curse for one of armed selenites have stabbed behind with goad wrenched wrist free from little tentacle held turned on goad bearer confound cried ive warned of what on earth do think im made of to stick into if touch again by way of answer pricked forthwith heard cavors voice in alarm entreaty even then think wanted to compromise with creature say bedford cried know way sting of second stab seemed to set free pent up reserve of energy in being instantly link of wrist chain snapped with snapped consideration have held unresisting in hand of moon creature for second at least be mad with fear anger took thought of consequence hit straight out at face of thing with goad chain be twisted round fist there came of beastly surprise of moon world be full mailed hand seemed to go clean through smashed like like softish sort of sweet with liquid in broke right in squelched splashed be like hitting damp toadstool flimsy body went spinning dozen yard fell with flabby impact be astonished be incredulous that living thing must be so flimsy for instant must have believed whole thing dream then have become real imminent again cavor other selenites seemed to have done anything from time when have turned about to time when dead selenite hit ground one stood back from two one alert arrest seemed to last at least second after selenite be down one must have be taking thing in seem to remember standing with arm half retracted trying also to take in what next clamoured brain what next then in moment one be moving perceived must get chain loose that before must do selenites have to be beaten off faced towards group of three goad bearer instantly one threw goad at swished over head suppose went flying into abyss behind leaped right at with might a goad flew over turned to run a jumped bore to ground came down right upon slipped upon smashed body fell seemed to wriggle under foot came into sitting position on hand blue back of selenites be receding into darkness bent link by main force untwisted chain have hampered about ankle sprang to foot with chain in hand goad flung javelin wise whistled by made rush towards darkness out of have come then turned back towards cavor who be still standing in light of rivulet near gulf convulsively busy with wrist at same time jabbering nonsense about idea come on cried hand answered then realising that dared not run back to because ill calculated step might carry over edge came shuffling towards with hand held out before gripped chain at once to unfasten where be panted run away theyll come back theyre throwing thing way will go by light to tunnel eh yes said hand be free dropped on knee fell to work on ankle bond whack came something know not what splashed livid streamlet into drop about far away on right piping whistling began whipped chain off foot put in hand hit with said without waiting for answer set off in big bound along path by have come have nasty sort of feeling that thing must jump out of darkness on to back heard impact of leap come following after ran in vast stride that running must understand be altogether different thing from running on earth on earth one leap almost instantly hit ground again on moon because of weaker pull one shot through air for several second before one came to earth in spite of violent hurry gave effect of long pause pause in one might have counted seven eight step one soared off sort of question ran through mind where be selenites what will do will ever get to tunnel be cavor far behind be likely to cut off then whack stride off again for step saw selenite running in front of leg going exactly a man must go on earth saw glance over shoulder heard shriek a ran aside out of way into darkness be think guide be not sure then in vast stride wall of rock have come into view on hand in two more stride be in tunnel tempering pace to low roof went on to bend then stopped turned back plug plug plug cavor came into view splashing into stream of blue light at stride grew larger blundered into stood clutching other for moment at least have shaken off captor be alone be very much out of breath spoke in panting broken sentence youve spoilt panted cavor nonsense cried be that death what be to do hide how can dark enough where up one of side cavern then think right come on strode on presently came to radiating dark cavern cavor be in front hesitated chose black mouth seemed to promise good hiding went towards turned dark said leg foot will light youre wet with luminous stuff tumult of sound in particular sound like clanging gong advancing up main tunnel became audible be horribly suggestive of tumultuous pursuit made bolt for unlit side cavern forthwith a ran along way be lit by irradiation of cavors leg lucky panted took off boot must fill place with clatter on rushed taking a small step a must to avoid striking roof of cavern after time seemed to be gaining on uproar became muffled dwindled died away stopped looked back heard pad pad of cavors foot receding then stopped also bedford whispered there sort of light in front of illustration bedford whispered there sort of light in front of looked at first must see nothing then perceived head shoulder dimly outlined against fainter darkness saw also that mitigation of darkness be not blue a other light within moon have be pallid grey very vague faint white daylight colour cavor noted difference a soon sooner than did think too that filled with same wild hope bedford whispered voice trembled that light be possible did not dare to say thing hoped then came pause suddenly knew by sound of foot that be striding towards pallor followed with beating heart xvi point of view light grew stronger a advanced in little time be nearly a strong a phosphorescence on cavors leg tunnel be expanding into cavern new light be at farther end of perceived something that set hope leaping bounding cavor said come from above be certain come from above made answer hurried on indisputably be grey light silvery light in moment be beneath filtered down through chink in wall of cavern a stared up drip came drop of water upon face started stood aside drip fell drop quite audibly on rocky floor cavor said if one of lift other can reach crack ill lift said incontinently hoisted a though be baby thrust arm into crack just at finger tip found little ledge by must hold must see white light be very much brighter now pulled up by two finger with scarcely effort though on earth weigh twelve stone reached to still higher corner of rock so got foot on narrow ledge stood up searched up rock with finger cleft broadened out upwardly climbable said to cavor can jump up to hand if hold down to wedged between side of cleft rested knee foot on ledge extended hand must not see cavor must hear rustle of movement a crouched to spring then whack be hanging to arm heavier than kitten lugged up until have hand on ledge must release confound said one must be mountaineer on moon so set in earnest to climbing for few minute clambered steadily then looked up again cleft opened out steadily light be brighter only be not daylight after in moment must see what be at sight must have beaten head against rock with disappointment for beheld simply irregularly sloping open space over slanting floor stood forest of little club shaped fungi shining gloriously with pinkish silvery light for moment stared at soft radiance then sprang forward upward among plucked up dozen flung against rock then sat down laughing bitterly a cavors ruddy face came into view phosphorescence again said need to hurry sit down make at home a spluttered over disappointment began to lob more of growth into cleft thought be daylight said daylight cried daybreak sunset cloud windy sky will ever see such thing again a spoke little picture of world seemed to rise before bright little clear like background of old italian picture sky that change sea that change hill green tree town city shining in sun think of wet roof at sunset cavor think of window of westward house made answer here be burrowing in beastly world that isnt world with inky ocean hidden in abominable blackness below outside torrid day that death stillness of night thing be chasing now beastly men of leather insect men come out of nightmare after theyre right what business have here smashing disturbing world for know whole planet be up after already in minute may hear whimpering gong going what be to do where be to go here be a comfortable a snake from jamrachs loose in surbiton villa be fault said cavor fault shouted good lord have idea curse idea if have refused to budge under goad yes must have carried over bridge yes must have carried from outside id rather be carried by fly across ceiling good heaven resumed destruction of fungi then suddenly saw something that struck even then cavor said chain be of gold be thinking intently with hand gripping cheek turned head slowly stared at when have repeated word at twisted chain about right hand so be said so be face lost transitory interest even a looked hesitated for moment then went on with interrupted meditation sat for space puzzling over fact have only just observed until considered blue light in have be have taken colour out of metal from discovery also started upon train of thought carried wide far forgot have just be asking what business have in moon gold be cavor who spoke first seems to that there be two course open to well either can attempt to make way fight way if necessary out to exterior again then hunt for sphere until find cold of night come to kill else paused yes said though knew what be coming might attempt once more to establish sort of understanding with mind of people in moon so far a im concerned first doubt dont see said cavor think can judge selenites by what have seen of central world civilised world will be far below in profounder cavern about sea region of crust in be be outlying district pastoral region at rate be interpretation selenites have seen may be only equivalent of cowboy engine tender use of goad in probability mooncalf goad lack of imagination show in expecting to be able to do just what can do indisputable brutality seem to point to something of sort if endured of must endure six inch plank across bottomless pit for very long said cavor then wont said discovered new line of possibility well suppose got into corner where must defend against hind labourer if for example must hold out for week so be probable that news of appearance must filter down to more intelligent populous part if exist must exist whence came tremendous machine thats possible worst of two chance might write up inscription on wall how do know eye must see sort of mark made if cut thats possible of course took up new thread of thought after said suppose dont think selenites so infinitely wiser than men must know lot more at least lot of different thing yes hesitated think youll quite admit cavor youre rather exceptional man how well youre rather lonely man have be be havent married never wanted to why never grew richer than happened to be never wanted that youve just rooted after knowledge well certain curiosity be natural think so thats just think other mind want to know remember once when asked why conducted research said wanted fr to have stuff called cavorite thing like know perfectly well didnt do for at time question took by surprise felt ought to have something to look like motive really conducted research because have to twist perhaps be isnt one man in million have that twist most men want well various thing very few want knowledge for own sake dont know perfectly well now selenites seem to be driving busy sort of being how do know that even most intelligent will take interest in world dont believe theyll even know have world never come out at night theyd freeze if did theyve probably never seen heavenly body at except blazing sun how be to know there be world what doe matter to if do well even if have have glimpse of few star even of earth crescent what of why must people living inside planet trouble to observe sort of thing men have done except for season sailing why must moon people well suppose there be few philosopher like be just very selenites wholl never hear of existence suppose selenite have dropped on earth when be at lympne youd have be last man in world to hear have come never read newspaper see chance against well for chance be sitting here doing nothing while precious time be flying tell weve got into fix weve come unarmed weve lost sphere weve got food weve shown ourselves to selenites made think be strange strong dangerous animal unless selenites be perfect fool theyll set about now hunt till find when find theyll try take if can kill if cant thats end of matter if take theyll probably kill through misunderstanding after be done for may discus perhaps shant get much fun out of go on on other hand here gold knocking about like cast iron at home if only can get of back if only can find sphere again before do get back then yes might put thing on sounder footing come back in bigger sphere with gun good lord cried cavor a though be horrible shied luminous fungus down cleft look here cavor said ive voting power anyhow in affair be case for practical man im practical man be not im not going to trust to selenites geometrical diagram again if can help thats get back drop secrecy most of come again reflected when came to moon said ought to have come alone question before meeting said be how to get back to sphere for time nursed knee in silence then seemed to decide for reason think said one can get data be clear that while sun be on side of moon air will be blowing through planet sponge from dark side hither on side at rate air will be expanding flowing out of moon cavern into crater very well there draught here so there be mean that be not dead end somewhere behind cleft go on up draught be blowing up be way have to go if try get up sort of chimney gully there be will not only get out of passage where be hunting for suppose gully be too narrow well come down again ssh said suddenly whats that listened at first be indistinct murmur then one picked out clang of gong must think be mooncalves said to be frightened at theyre coming along passage said cavor must be theyll not think of cleft theyll go past listened again for space time whispered theyre likely to have sort of weapon then suddenly sprang to foot good heaven cavor cried will theyll see fungi have be pitching down theyll didnt finish sentence turned about made leap over fungus top towards upper end of cavity saw that space turned upward became draughty cleft again ascending to impenetrable darkness be about to clamber up into then with happy inspiration turned back what be doing asked cavor go on said went back got two of shining fungi putting one into breast pocket of flannel jacket so that stuck out to light climbing went back with other for cavor noise of selenites be now so loud that seemed must be already beneath cleft might be must have difficulty in clambering into might hesitate to ascend against possible resistance at rate have now comforting knowledge of enormous muscular superiority birth in planet gave in minute be clambering with gigantic vigour after cavors blue lit heel xvii fight in cave of moon butcher know how far clambered before came to grating may be ascended only few hundred foot at time seemed to might have hauled jammed hopped wedged ourselves through mile more of vertical ascent whenever recall that time there come into head heavy clank of golden chain followed movement very soon knuckle knee be raw have bruise on one cheek after time first violence of effort diminished movement became more deliberate le painful noise of pursuing selenites have died away altogether seemed almost a though have not traced up crack after in spite of tell tale heap of broken fungi must have lain beneath at time cleft narrowed so much that must scarce squeeze up at others expanded into great drusy cavity studded with prickly crystal thickly beset with dull shining fungoid pimple sometimes twisted spirally at other time slanted down nearly to horizontal direction ever again there be intermittent drip trickle of water by once twice seemed to that small living thing have rustled out of reach what be never saw may have be venomous beast for know did harm be now tuned to pitch when weird creeping thing more le mattered little at last far above came familiar bluish light again then saw that filtered through grating barred way whispered a pointed out to one became more more cautious in ascent presently be close under grating by pressing face against bar must see limited portion of cavern beyond be clearly large space lit doubt by rivulet of same blue light that have seen flow from beating machinery intermittent trickle of water dropped ever again between bar near face first endeavour be naturally to see what might be upon floor of cavern grating lay in depression whose rim hid from eye foiled attention then fell back upon suggestion of various sound heard presently eye caught number of faint shadow played across dim roof far overhead indisputably there be several selenites perhaps considerable number in space for must hear noise of intercourse faint sound identified a footfall there be also succession of regularly repeated sound chid chid chid began ceased suggestive of knife spade hacking at soft substance then came clank a if of chain whistle rumble a of truck running over hollowed place then again that chid chid chid resumed shadow told of shape moved quickly rhythmically in agreement with regular sound rested when ceased put head close together began to discus thing in noiseless whisper be occupied said be occupied in way yes theyre not seeking thinking of perhaps have not heard of others be hunting about below if suddenly appeared here looked at one there might be chance to parley said cavor said not a be for space remained occupied by own thought chid chid chid went chopping shadow moved to fro looked at grating flimsy said might bend two of bar crawl through wasted little time in vague discussion then took one of bar in hand got foot up against rock until be almost on level with head so thrust against bar bent so suddenly that almost slipped clambered about bent adjacent bar in opposite direction then took luminous fungus from pocket dropped down fissure dont do anything hastily whispered cavor a twisted up through opening have enlarged have glimpse of busy figure a came through grating immediately bent down so that rim of depression in grating lay hid from eye so lay flat signalling advice to cavor a also prepared to come through presently be side by side in depression peering over edge at cavern occupant be much larger cavern than have supposed from first glimpse of looked up from lowest portion of sloping floor widened out a receded from roof came down hid remoter portion altogether lying in line along length vanishing at last far away in tremendous perspective be number of huge shape huge pallid hull upon selenites be busy at first seemed big white cylinder of vague import then noted head upon lying towards eyeless skinless like head of sheep at butcher perceived be carcass of mooncalves being cut up much a crew of whaler might cut up moored whale be cutting off flesh in strip on of farther trunk white rib be showing be sound of hatchet that made that chid chid way away thing like trolley cable drawn loaded with chunk of lax meat be running up slope of cavern floor enormous long avenue of hull be destined to be food gave sense of vast populousness of moon world second only to effect of first glimpse down shaft seemed to at first that selenites must be standing on trestle supported plank then saw that plank support hatchet be really of same leaden hue a fetter have seemed before white light came to bear on number of very thick looking crowbar lay about floor have apparently assisted to turn dead mooncalf over on side be perhaps six foot long with shaped handle very tempting looking weapon whole place be lit by three transverse stream of blue fluid lay for long time noting thing in silence well said cavor at last crouched lower turned to have come upon brilliant idea unless lowered body by crane said must be nearer surface than thought why mooncalf doesnt hop hasnt got wing peered over edge of hollow again wonder now began after have never gone far from surface stopped by grip on arm have heard noise from cleft below twisted about lay a still a death with sense alert in little while did not doubt that something be quietly ascending cleft very slowly quite noiselessly assured myself of good grip on chain waited for something to appear just look at chap with hatchet again said theyre right said cavor took sort of provisional aim at gap in grating must hear now quite distinctly soft twittering of ascending selenites dab of hand against rock falling of dust from grip a clambered then must see that there be something moving dimly in blackness below grating what might be must not distinguish whole thing seemed to hang fire just for moment then smash have sprung to foot struck savagely at something have flashed out at be keen point of spear have thought since length in narrowness of cleft must have prevented being sloped to reach anyhow shot out from grating like tongue of snake missed flew back flashed again second time snatched caught wrenched away not before have darted ineffectually at shouted with triumph a felt hold of selenite resist pull for moment give then be jabbing down through bar amidst squeal from darkness cavor have snapped off other spear be leaping flourishing beside making inefficient jab clang clang came up through grating then axe hurtled through air whacked against rock beyond to remind of fleshers at carcass up cavern turned be coming towards in open order waving ax be short thick little beggar with long arm strikingly different from one have seen before if have not heard of before must have realised situation with incredible swiftness stared at for moment spear in hand guard that grating cavor cried howled to intimidate rushed to meet two of missed with hatchet rest fled incontinently then two also be sprinting away up cavern with hand clenched head down never saw men run like knew spear have be good for be thin flimsy only effectual for thrust too long for quick recover so only chased selenites a far a first carcass stopped there picked up one of crowbar be lying about felt comfortingly heavy equal to smashing number of selenites threw away spear picked up second crowbar for other hand felt five time better than have with spear shook two threateningly at selenites who have come to halt in little crowd far away up cavern then turned about to look at cavor be leaping from side to side of grating making threatening jab with broken spear be right must keep selenites down for time at rate looked up cavern again what on earth be going to do now be cornered in sort of way already butcher up cavern have be surprised be probably scared have special weapon only little hatchet of theirs way lay escape sturdy little form ever so much shorter thicker than mooncalf herd be scattered up slope in way be eloquent of indecision have moral advantage of mad bull in street for there seemed tremendous crowd of very probably there be selenites down cleft have certainly infernally long spear might be have other surprise for confound if charged up cave must let up behind if didnt little brute up cave must probably get reinforced heaven alone knew what tremendous engine of warfare gun bomb terrestrial torpedo unknown world below foot vaster world of have only pricked outer cuticle might not presently send up to destruction became clear only thing to do be to charge became clearer a leg of number of fresh selenites appeared running down cavern towards bedford cried cavor behold be half way between grating go back cried what be doing theyve got like gun struggling in grating between defensive spear appeared head shoulder of singularly lean angular selenite bearing complicated apparatus realised cavors utter incapacity for fight have in hand for moment hesitated then rushed past whirling crowbar shouting to confound aim of selenite be aiming in queerest way with thing against stomach chuzz thing wasnt gun went off like cross bow more dropped in middle of leap didnt fall down simply came down little shorter than must have done if hadnt be hit from feel of shoulder thing might have tapped glanced off then left hand hit against shaft perceived there be sort of spear sticking half through shoulder moment after got home with crowbar in right hand hit selenite fair square collapsed crushed crumpled head smashed like egg dropped crowbar pulled spear out of shoulder began to jab down grating into darkness at jab came shriek twitter finally hurled spear down upon with strength leapt up picked up crowbar again started for multitude up cavern bedford cried cavor bedford a flew past seem to remember footstep coming on behind step leap whack step leap leap seemed to last age with cave opened out number of selenites visible increased at first seemed running about like ant in disturbed ant hill one two waving hatchet coming to meet more running away bolting sideways into avenue of carcass then presently others came in sight carrying spear then others saw most extraordinary thing hand foot bolting for cover cavern grew darker farther up flick something flew over head flick a soared in mid stride saw spear hit quiver in one of carcass to left then a came down one hit ground before heard remote chuzz with thing be fired flick flick for moment be shower be volleying stopped dead dont think thought clearly then seem to remember kind of stereotyped phrase running through mind zone of fire seek cover know made dash for space between two of carcass stood there panting feeling very wicked looked round for cavor for moment seemed a if have vanished from world then came out of darkness between row of carcass rocky wall of cavern saw little face dark blue shining with perspiration emotion be saying something what be did not heed have realised that might work from mooncalf to mooncalf up cave until be near enough to charge home be charge nothing come on said led way bedford cried unavailingly mind be busy a went up that narrow alley between dead body wall of cavern rock curved about must not enfilade though in narrow space must not leap yet with earth born strength be still able to go very much faster than selenites reckoned must presently come right among once be on must be nearly a formidable a black beetle only there must first of be volley thought of stratagem whipped off flannel jacket a ran bedford panted cavor behind glanced back what said be pointing upward over carcass white light said white light again looked be even so faint white ghost of twilight in remoter cavern roof seemed to give double strength keep close said flat long selenite dashed out of darkness squealed fled halted stopped cavor with hand hung jacket over crowbar ducked round next carcass dropped jacket crowbar showed darted back chuzz flick just one arrow came be close on selenites be standing in crowd broad short tall together with little battery of shooting implement pointing down cave three four other arrow followed first then fire ceased stuck out head escaped by hair breadth time drew dozen shot more heard selenites shouting twittering a if with excitement a shot picked up jacket crowbar again now said thrust out jacket chuzz zz zz zz chuzz in instant jacket have grown thick beard of arrow be quivering over carcass behind instantly slipped crowbar out of jacket dropped jacket for know to contrary be lying up there in moon now rushed out upon for minute perhaps be massacre be too fierce to discriminate selenites be probably too scared to fight at rate made sort of fight against saw scarlet a saying be remember seemed to be wading among leathery thin thing a man wade through tall grass mowing hitting first right then left smash smash little drop of moisture flew about trod on thing crushed piped went slippery crowd seemed to open close flow like water seemed to have combined plan there be spear flew about be grazed over ear by one be stabbed once in arm once in cheek only found that out afterwards when blood have have time to run cool feel wet what cavor did know for space seemed that fighting have lasted for age must need go on for ever then suddenly be over there be nothing to be seen back of head bobbing up down a owner ran in direction seemed altogether unhurt ran forward pace shouting then turned about be amazed have come right through in vast flying stride be behind running hither thither to hide enormous astonishment at evaporation of great fight into have hurled not little of exultation did not seem to that have discovered selenites be unexpectedly flimsy be unexpectedly strong laughed stupidly fantastic moon glanced for moment at smashed writhing body be scattered over cavern floor with vague idea of further violence then hurried on after cavor footnote remember seeing wooden thing on moon door table everything corresponding to terrestrial joinery be made of metal believe for most part of gold a metal must of course naturally recommend other thing being equal on account of ease in working toughness durability xviii in sunlight presently saw that cavern before opened on hazy void in moment have emerged upon sort of slanting gallery projected into vast circular space huge cylindrical pit running vertically up down round pit slanting gallery ran without parapet protection for turn half then plunged high above into rock again somehow reminded then of one of spiral turn of railway through saint gothard be tremendously huge can scarcely hope to convey to titanic proportion of place titanic effect of eye followed up vast declivity of pit wall overhead far above beheld round opening set with faint star half of lip about well nigh blinding with white light of sun at cried aloud simultaneously come on said leading way there said cavor very carefully stepped nearer edge of gallery followed example craned forward looked down be dazzled by gleam of light above must see only bottomless darkness with spectral patch of crimson purple floating therein yet if must not see must hear out of darkness came sound sound like angry hum one can hear if one put one ear outside hive of bee sound out of enormous hollow may be four mile beneath foot for moment listened then tightened grip on crowbar led way up gallery must be shaft looked down upon said cavor under lid below there be where saw light light said yes light of world now will never see well come back said for now have escaped so much be rashly sanguine that must recover sphere answer did not catch eh asked doesnt matter answered hurried on in silence suppose that slanting lateral way be four five mile long allowing for curvature ascended at slope must have made almost impossibly steep on earth one strode up easily under lunar condition saw only two selenites during portion of flight directly became aware of ran headlong be clear that knowledge of strength violence have reached way to exterior be unexpectedly plain spiral gallery straightened into steeply ascendent tunnel floor bearing abundant trace of mooncalves so straight short in proportion to vast arch that part of be absolutely dark almost immediately began to lighten then far off high up quite blindingly brilliant appeared opening on exterior slope of alpine steepness surmounted by crest of bayonet shrub tall broken down now dry dead in spiky silhouette against sun be strange that men to whom very vegetation have seemed so weird horrible little time ago must now behold with emotion home coming exile might feel at sight of native land welcomed even rareness of air made pant a ran rendered speaking no longer easy thing that have be effort to make heard larger grew sunlit circle above larger nearer tunnel sank into rim of indistinguishable black saw dead bayonet shrub no longer with touch of green in brown dry thick shadow of upper branch high out of sight made densely interlaced pattern upon tumbled rock at immediate mouth of tunnel be wide trampled space where mooncalves have come gone came out upon space at last into light heat that hit pressed upon traversed exposed area painfully clambered up slope among scrub stem sat down at last panting in high place beneath shadow of mass of twisted lava even in shade rock felt hot air be intensely hot be in great physical discomfort for that be no longer in nightmare seemed to have come to own province again beneath star fear stress of flight through dim passage fissure below have fallen from that last fight have filled with enormous confidence in ourselves so far a selenites be concerned looked back almost incredulously at black opening from have just emerged down there be in blue glow now in memory seemed next thing to absolute darkness have met with thing like mad mockery of men helmet headed creature have walked in fear before have submitted to until must submit no longer behold have smashed like wax scattered like chaff fled vanished like creature of dream rubbed eye doubting whether have not slept dreamt thing by reason of fungus have eaten suddenly discovered blood upon face then that shirt be sticking painfully to shoulder arm confound said gauging injury with investigatory hand suddenly that distant tunnel mouth became a be watching eye cavor said what be going to do now what be going to do shook head with eye fixed upon tunnel how can one tell what will do depends on what think of dont see how can begin to guess depends upon what have in reserve a say cavor have touched merest outside of world may have sort of thing inside here even with shooting thing might make bad for yet after said even if dont find sphere at once there be chance for might hold out even through night might go down there again make fight for stared about with speculative eye character of scenery have altered altogether by reason of enormous growth subsequent drying of scrub crest on sat be high commanded wide prospect of crater landscape saw now sere dry in late autumn of lunar afternoon rising one behind other be long slope field of trampled brown where mooncalves have pastured far away in full blaze of sun drove of basked slumberously scattered

mooncalves can not guess at time believed former be case if be to set fire to stuff said might find sphere among ash cavor did not seem to hear be peering under hand at star still in spite of intense sunlight be abundantly visible in sky how long do think have be here asked at last be where on moon two earthly day perhaps more nearly ten do know sun be past zenith sinking in west in four day time le will be night weve only eaten once know there be star why must time seem different because be on smaller planet dont know there be how doe one tell time hunger fatigue thing be different everything be different everything to seems that since first came out of sphere have be only question of hour long hour at most ten day said that leaf looked up at sun for moment then saw that be half way from zenith to western edge of thing four day cavor mustnt sit here dream how do think may begin stood up must get fixed point can recognise might hoist flag handkerchief something quarter ground work round that stood up beside yes said there be nothing for to hunt sphere nothing may find certainly may find if not must keep on looking looked way glanced up at sky down at tunnel astonished by sudden gesture of impatience oh have done foolishly to have come to pas think how might have be thing might have done may do something yet never thing might have done here below foot be world think of what that world must be think of machine saw lid shaft be just remote outlying thing creature have seen fought with more than ignorant peasant dweller in outskirt yokel labourer half akin to brute down below cavern beneath cavern tunnel structure way must open out be greater wider more populous a one descends assuredly right down at last to central sea that wash round core of moon think of inky water under spare light if indeed eye need light think of cascading tributary pouring down channel to feed think of tide upon surface rush swirl of ebb flow perhaps have ship go upon perhaps down there be mighty city swarming way wisdom order passing wit of man may die here upon never see master who must be ruling over thing may freeze die here air will freeze thaw upon then then will come upon come on stiff silent body find sphere can not find will understand at last too late thought effort ended here in vain voice for speech sounded like voice of one heard in telephone weak far away darkness said one might get over how dont know how be to know one might carry torch one might have lamp others might understand stood for moment with hand held down rueful face staring out over waste defied then with gesture of renunciation turned towards with proposal for systematic hunting of sphere can return said looked about first of will have to get to earth must bring back lamp to carry climbing iron hundred necessary thing yes said can take back earnest of success in gold looked at golden crowbar said nothing for space stood with hand clasped behind back staring across crater at last sighed spoke be found way here to find way isnt always to be master of way if take secret back to earth what will happen see how can keep secret for year for even part of year sooner later must come out even if other men rediscover then government power will struggle to get hither will fight against one against moon people will only spread warfare multiply occasion of war in little while in very little while if tell secret planet to deepest gallery will be strewn with human dead other thing be doubtful be certain be not a though man have use for moon what good must moon be to men even of own planet what have made battle ground theatre of infinite folly small a world be short a time have still in little life down there far more than can do science have toiled too long forging weapon for fool to use be time held hand let find out for again in thousand year time there be method of secrecy said looked up at smiled after said why must one worry there be little chance of finding sphere down below thing be brewing simply human habit of hoping till die make think of return trouble be only beginning have shown moon folk violence have given taste of quality chance be about a good a tiger have got loose killed man in hyde park news of must be running down from gallery to gallery down towards central part sane being will ever let take sphere back to earth after so much a have seen of arent improving chance said by sitting here stood up side by side after said must separate must stick up handkerchief on tall spike here fasten firmly from a centre must work over crater must go westward moving out in semicircle to fro towards setting sun must move first with shadow on right until be at right angle with direction of handkerchief then with shadow on left will do same to east will look into gully examine skerry of rock will do can to find sphere if see selenites will hide from a well a can for drink must take snow if feel need of food must kill mooncalf if can eat such flesh a have raw so will go own way if one of come upon sphere must come back to white handkerchief stand by signal to other if cavor glanced up at sun go on seeking until night cold overtake suppose selenites have found sphere hidden shrugged shoulder if presently come hunting made answer have better take club said shook head stared away from across waste for moment did not start looked round at shyly hesitated au revoir said felt odd stab of emotion sense of how have galled other particularly how must have galled came to confound thought might have done better be on point of asking to shake hand for somehow be how felt just then when put foot together leapt away from towards north seemed to drift through air a dead leaf must do fell lightly leapt again stood for moment watching then faced westward reluctantly pulled together with something of feeling of man who leap into icy water selected leaping point plunged forward to explore solitary half of moon world dropped rather clumsily among rock stood up looked about clambered on to rocky slab leapt again when presently looked for cavor be hidden from eye handkerchief showed out bravely on headland white in blaze of sun determined not to lose sight of handkerchief might betide xix mr bedford alone in little while seemed to a though have always be alone on moon hunted for time with certain intentness heat be still very great thinness of air felt like hoop about one chest came presently into hollow basin bristling with tall brown dry frond about edge sat down under to rest cool intended to rest for only little while put down club beside sat resting chin on hand saw with sort of colourless interest that rock of basin where here there crackling dry lichen have shrunk away to show be veined splattered with gold here there boss of rounded wrinkled gold projected from among litter what did matter now sort of languor have possession of limb mind did not believe for moment that must ever find sphere in vast desiccated wilderness seemed to lack motive for effort until selenites must come then supposed must exert obeying that unreasonable imperative that urge man before thing to preserve defend life albeit may preserve only to die more painfully in little while why have come to moon thing presented to a perplexing problem what be spirit in man that urge for ever to depart from happiness security to toil to place in danger to risk even reasonable certainty of death dawned upon up there in moon a thing ought always to have known man be not made simply to go about being safe comfortable well fed amused almost man if put thing to not in word in shape of opportunity will show that know a much against interest against happiness be constantly being driven to do unreasonable thing force not impels go must why why sitting there in midst of useless moon gold amidst thing of world took count of life assuming be to die castaway upon moon failed altogether to see what purpose have served got light on point at rate be clearer to than have ever be in life before be not serving own purpose that life have in truth never served purpose of private life whose purpose what purpose be serving ceased to speculate on why have come to moon took wider sweep why have come to earth why have private life at lost at last in bottomless speculation thought became vague cloudy longer leading in definite direction have not felt heavy weary can not imagine one doing so upon moon suppose be greatly fatigued at rate slept slumbering there rested greatly think sun be setting violence of heat abating through time slumbered when at last be roused from slumber by remote clamour felt active capable again rubbed eye stretched arm rose to foot be little stiff at once prepared to resume search shouldered golden club one on shoulder went on out of ravine of gold veined rock sun be certainly lower much lower than have be air be very much cooler perceived must have slept time seemed to that faint touch of misty blueness hung about western cliff leapt to little bos of rock surveyed crater must see sign of mooncalves selenites must see cavor must see handkerchief afar off spread out on thicket of thorn looked about then leapt forward to next convenient view point beat way round in semicircle back again in still remoter crescent be very fatiguing hopeless air be really very much cooler seemed to that shadow under westward cliff be growing broad ever again stopped reconnoitred there be sign of cavor sign of selenites seemed to mooncalves must have be driven into interior again must see none of became more more desirous of seeing cavor winged outline of sun have sunk now until be scarcely distance of diameter from rim of sky be oppressed by idea that selenites must presently close lid valve shut out under inexorable onrush of lunar night seemed to high time that abandoned search that took counsel together felt how urgent be that must decide soon upon course have failed to find sphere no longer have time to seek once valve be closed with outside be lost men great night of space must descend upon that blackness of void be only absolute death being shrank from that approach must get into moon again though be slain in doing be haunted by vision of freezing to death of hammering with last strength on valve of great pit took thought more of sphere thought only of finding cavor again be half inclined to go back into moon without rather than seek until be too late be already half way back towards handkerchief when suddenly saw sphere did not find so much a found be lying much further to westward than have gone sloping ray of sinking sun reflected from glass have suddenly proclaimed presence in dazzling beam for instant thought be new device of selenites against then understood threw up arm shouted ghostly shout set off in vast leap towards missed one of leap dropped into deep ravine twisted ankle after stumbled at almost leap be in state of hysterical agitation trembling violently quite breathless long before got to three time at least have to stop with hand resting on side spite of thin dryness of air perspiration be wet upon face thought of nothing sphere until reached forgot even trouble of cavors whereabouts last leap flung with hand hard against glass then lay against panting trying vainly to shout cavor here be sphere when have recovered little peered through thick glass thing inside seemed tumbled stooped to peer closer then attempted to get in have to hoist over little to get head through manhole screw stopper be inside must see now that nothing have be touched nothing have suffered lay there a have left when have dropped out amidst snow for time be wholly occupied in making remaking inventory found be trembling violently be good to see that familiar dark interior again can not tell how good presently crept inside sat down among thing looked through glass at moon world shivered placed gold club upon bale sought out took little food not so much because wanted because be there then occurred to that be time to go out signal for cavor did not go out signal for cavor forthwith something held to sphere after everything be coming right there must be still time for to get more of magic stone give one mastery over men away there close handy be gold for picking up sphere must travel a well half full of gold a though be empty must go back now master of ourselves world then roused at last with effort got out of sphere shivered a emerged for evening air be growing very cold stood in hollow staring about scrutinised bush round very carefully before leapt to rocky shelf hard by took once more what have be first leap in moon now made with effort whatever growth decay of vegetation have gone on apace whole aspect of rock have changed still be possible to make out slope on seed have germinated rocky mass from have taken first view of crater spiky shrub on slope stood brown sere now thirty foot high cast long shadow stretched out of sight little seed clustered in upper branch be brown ripe work be done be brittle ready to fall crumple under freezing air so soon a nightfall came huge cactus have swollen a watched have long since burst scattered spore to four quarter of moon amazing little corner in universe landing place of men day thought will have inscription standing there right in midst of hollow came to if only teeming world within knew of full import of moment how furious tumult must become a yet must scarcely be dreaming of significance of coming for if did crater must surely be uproar of pursuit instead of a still a death looked about for place from might signal to cavor saw same patch of rock to have leapt from present standpoint still bare barren in sun for moment hesitated at going so far from sphere then with pang of shame at hesitation leapt from vantage point surveyed crater again far away at top of enormous shadow cast be little white handkerchief fluttering on bush be very little very far cavor be not in sight seemed to that by time ought to be looking for be agreement be nowhere to be seen stood waiting watching hand shading eye expecting moment to distinguish very probably stood there for quite long time tried to shout be reminded of thinness of air made undecided step back towards sphere lurking dread of selenites made hesitate to signal whereabouts by hoisting one of sleeping blanket on to adjacent scrub searched crater again have effect of emptiness chilled be still sound from selenites in world beneath even have died away be a still a death save for faint stir of shrub about in little breeze be rising there be sound shadow of sound breeze blew chill confound cavor took deep breath put hand to side of mouth cavor bawled sound be like manikin shouting far away looked at handkerchief looked behind at broadening shadow of westward cliff looked under hand at sun seemed to that almost visibly be creeping down sky felt must act instantly if be to save cavor whipped off vest flung a mark on sere bayonet of shrub behind then set off in straight line towards handkerchief perhaps be couple of mile away matter of few hundred leap stride have already told how one seemed to hang through lunar leap in suspense sought cavor marvelled why must be hidden in leap must feel sun setting behind time touched ground be tempted to go back last leap be in depression below handkerchief stride stood on former vantage point within arm reach of stood up straight scanned world about between lengthening bar of shadow far away down long declivity be opening of tunnel up have fled shadow reached towards stretched towards touched like finger of night not sign of cavor not sound in stillness only that stir waving of scrub of shadow increased suddenly violently shivered cav began realised once more uselessness of human voice in thin air silence silence of death then be eye caught something little thing lying perhaps fifty yard away down slope amidst litter of bent broken branch what be knew yet for reason must not know went nearer to be little cricket cap cavor have worn did not touch stood looking at saw then that scattered branch about have be forcibly smashed trampled hesitated stepped forward picked up stood with cavors cap in hand staring at trampled reed thorn about on of be little smear of something dark something dared not touch dozen yard away perhaps rising breeze dragged something into view something small vividly white be little piece of paper crumpled tightly a though have be clutched tightly picked up on be smear of red eye caught faint pencil mark smoothed out saw uneven broken writing ending at last in crooked streak upon paper set to decipher have be injured about knee think

illegible before get be beating about then writing became convulsive can hear guessed tracing meant then be quite unreadable for space then came little string of word be quite distinct different sort of selenite altogether who appears to be directing writing became mere hasty confusion again have larger brain case much larger slenderer body very short leg make gentle noise move with organised deliberation though be wounded helpless here appearance still give hope be like cavor have not shot at attempted injury intend then came sudden streak of pencil across paper on back edge blood a stood there stupid perplexed with dumbfounding relic in hand something very soft light chill touched hand for moment ceased to be then thing little white speck drifted shadow be tiny snowflake first snowflake herald of night looked up with start sky have darkened now almost to blackness be thick with gathering multitude of coldly watchful star looked eastward light of shrivelled world be touched with sombre bronze westward sun robbed now by thickening white mist of heat splendour be touching crater rim be sinking out of sight shrub jagged tumbled rock stood out against in bristling disorder of black shape into great lake of darkness westward vast wreath of mist be sinking cold wind set crater shivering suddenly for moment be in puff of falling snow world about grey dim then be heard not loud penetrating a at first faint dim like dying voice that tolling same tolling have welcomed coming of day boom boom boom echoed about crater seemed to throb with throbbing of greater star blood red crescent of sun disk sank a tolled out boom boom boom what have happened to cavor through tolling stood there stupidly at last tolling ceased suddenly open mouth of tunnel down below there shut like eye vanished out of sight then indeed be alone over around closing in on embracing ever be eternal that be before beginning that triumph over end enormous void in light life being be thin vanishing splendour of falling star cold stillness silence infinite final night of space sense of solitude desolation became sense of overwhelming presence stooped towards that almost touched cried not yet not

from dreamless sleep immediately perceived that if wanted to keep awake alive must get light open window so a to get grip of something with eye besides be cold kicked off from bale therefore clawed on to thin cord within glass crawled along until got to manhole rim so got bearing for light blind stud took shove off flying once round bale getting scare from something big flimsy be drifting loose got hand on cord quite close to stud reached lit little lamp first of to see what be have collided with discovered that old copy of lloyd news have slipped mooring be adrift in void brought out of infinite to own proper dimension again made laugh pant for time suggested idea of little oxygen from one of cylinder after lit heater until felt warm then took food then set to work in very gingerly fashion on cavorite blind to see if must guess by mean how sphere be travelling first blind opened shut at once hung for time flattened blinded by sunlight have hit after thinking little started upon window at right angle to one got huge crescent moon little crescent earth behind second time be amazed to find how far be from moon have reckoned that not only must have little none of kick off that earth atmosphere have given at start that tangential fly off of moon spin must be at least twenty eight time le than earth have expected to discover hanging over crater on edge of night be now only part of outline of white crescent filled sky cavor be already infinitesimal tried to imagine what must have happened to at time must think of nothing death seemed to see bent smashed at foot of interminably high cascade of blue about stupid insect stared under inspiring touch of drifting newspaper became practical again for while be quite clear to that what have to do be to get back to earth a far a must see be drifting away from have happened to cavor even if be still alive seemed to incredible after blood stained scrap be powerless to help there be living dead behind mantle of rayless night there must remain at least until must summon fellow men to assistance must do that something of sort have in mind to come back to earth if be possible then a maturer consideration might determine to show explain sphere to few discreet person act with else to keep secret sell gold obtain weapon provision assistant return with advantage to deal on equal term with flimsy people of moon to rescue cavor if be still possible at rate to procure sufficient supply of gold to place subsequent proceeding on firmer basis be hoping far have first to get back set to decide just exactly how return to earth must be contrived a struggled with problem ceased to worry about what must do when got there at last only care be to get back puzzled out at last that best chance must be to drop back towards moon a near a dared in order to gather velocity then to shut window fly behind when be past to open earthward window so get off at good pace homeward whether must ever reach earth by device whether might not simply find spinning about in hyperbolic parabolic curve other must not tell later have happy inspiration by opening certain window to moon have appeared in sky in front of earth turned course aside so a to head off earth have become evident to must pas behind without such expedient did very great deal of complicated thinking over problem for be mathematician in end be certain be much more good luck than reasoning enabled to hit earth have known then a know now mathematical chance there be against doubt if must have troubled even to touch stud to make attempt having puzzled out what considered to be thing to do opened moonward window squatted down effort lifted for time foot so into air hung there in oddest way waited for crescent to get bigger bigger until felt be near enough for safety then must shut window fly past moon with velocity have got from if did not smash upon so go on towards earth be what did at last felt moonward start be sufficient shut out sight of moon from eye in state of mind be now recall incredibly free from anxiety distressful quality sat down to begin vigil in little speck of matter in infinite space must last until must strike earth

again lest must fail in end be in darkness save for earthshine glitter of star below everything be so absolutely silent still might indeed have be only being in universe yet strangely enough have more feeling of loneliness fear than if have be lying in bed on earth now seems stranger to since during last hour in crater of moon sense of utter loneliness have be agony incredible a will seem interval of time spent in space have sort of proportion to other interval of time in life sometimes seemed a though sat through immeasurable eternity like god upon lotus leaf again a though there be momentary pause a leapt from moon to earth in truth be altogether week of earthly time have done with care anxiety hunger fear for space floated thinking with strange breadth freedom of that have undergone of

floating in still serenity of space why must be disturbed about bedfords shortcoming be not responsible for for time struggled against really very grotesque delusion tried to summon memory of vivid

out of space time that poor bedford be just peephole through looked at life bedford however disavowed there be most certainly bound up with knew that wherever might be must need feel stress of desire sympathise with joy sorrow until life must end with dying of bedford what then enough of remarkable phase of experience tell here simply to show how one isolation departure from planet touched not only function feeling of organ of body indeed also very fabric of mind with strange unanticipated disturbance through major portion of vast space journey hung thinking of such immaterial thing a hung dissociated apathetic cloudy megalo maniac a be amidst star planet in void of space not only world to be returning blue lit cavern of selenites helmet face gigantic wonderful machine fate of cavor

three other pleasant looking young men with towel blazer straw hat coming down sand towards evidently early bathing section of littlestone help said young man rather became vaguely active what particularly do want done turned round gesticulated three young men accelerated pace in minute be about plying with question be indisposed to answer ill tell that later said im dead beat im rag come up to hotel said foremost little man well look after thing there hesitated cant said in sphere there two big bar of gold looked incredulously at one then at with new inquiry went to sphere stooped crept in presently have selenites crowbar broken chain before if have not be so horribly fagged must have laughed at be like kitten round beetle didnt know what to do with stuff fat little man stooped lifted end of one of bar then dropped with grunt then did lead gold said one oh gold said gold right enough said third then stared at then stared at ship lying at anchor say cried little man where did get be too tired to keep up lie got in moon saw stare at one look here said im not going to argue now help carry lump of gold up to hotel guess with rest two of can manage one ill trail chain thing ill tell more when ive have food how about thing wont hurt there said anyhow confound must stop there now if tide come up will float right in state of enormous wonderment young men most obediently hoisted treasure on shoulder with limb felt like lead headed sort of procession towards distant fragment of sea front half way there be reinforced by two awe stricken little girl with spade later lean little boy with penetrating sniff appeared be remember wheeling bicycle accompanied at distance of about hundred yard on right flank then suppose gave up a uninteresting mounted bicycle rode off over level sand in direction of sphere glanced back after wont touch said stout young man reassuringly be only too willing to be reassured at first something of grey of morning be in mind presently sun disengaged from level cloud of horizon lit world turned leaden sea to glittering water spirit rose sense of vast importance of thing have done have yet to do came with sunlight into mind laughed aloud a foremost man staggered under gold when indeed took place in world how amazed world must be if have not be for inordinate fatigue landlord of littlestone hotel must have be amusing a hesitated between gold respectable company on one hand filthy appearance on other at last found in terrestrial bathroom once more with warm water to wash with change of raiment preposterously small indeed anyhow clean that genial little man have lent lent razor too must not screw up resolution to attack even outpost of bristling beard covered face sat down to english breakfast ate with sort of languid appetite appetite many week old very decrepit stirred to answer question of four young men told truth well said a press got in moon moon yes moon in sky how do mean what say confound that have just come from moon exactly through space in ball took delicious mouthful of egg made private note that when went back to moon must take box of egg must see clearly that did not believe one word of what told evidently considered most respectable liar have ever met glanced at one then concentrated fire of eye on fancy expected clue to in way helped to salt seemed to find something significant in peppering egg strangely shaped mass of gold have staggered under held mind there lump lay in front of worth thousand of pound a impossible for one to steal a house piece of land a looked at curious face over coffee cup realised something of enormous wilderness of explanation into must have to wander to render comprehensible again dont really mean began youngest young man in tone of one who speaks to obstinate child just pas that toast rack said shut up completely look here say began one of others be not going to believe that know ah well said shrugged shoulder doesnt want to tell said youngest young man in stage aside then with appearance of great sang froid dont mind if take cigarette waved cordial assent proceeded with breakfast two of others went looked out of farther window talked inaudibly be struck by thought tide said be running out there be pause doubt who must answer near ebb said fat little man well anyhow said wont float far decapitated third egg began little speech look here said please dont imagine im surly telling uncivil lie anything of sort im forced almost to be little short mysterious can quite understand be a queer a can be that imagination must be going can assure youre in at memorable time cant make clear to now impossible give word of honour ive come from moon thats can tell same im tremendously obliged to know tremendously hope that manner hasnt in way given offence oh not in least said youngest young man affably can quite understand staring hard at time heeled chair back until very nearly upset recovered with exertion not bit of said fat young man dont imagine got up dispersed walked about lit cigarette generally tried to show be perfectly amiable disengaged entirely free from slightest curiosity about sphere im going to keep eye on ship out there same heard one of remarking in undertone if only must have forced to must believe even have gone out left went on with third egg weather fat little man remarked presently have be immense have not dont know when have have summer phoo whizz like tremendous rocket somewhere window be broken whats said isnt cried little man rushed to corner window others rushed to window likewise sat staring at suddenly leapt up knocked over third egg rushed for window also have just thought of something nothing to be seen there cried little man rushing for door that boy cried bawling in hoarse fury that accursed boy turning about pushed waiter aside be just bringing more toast rushed violently out of room down out upon queer little esplanade in front of hotel sea have be smooth be rough now with hurrying cat paw about where sphere have be be tumbled water like wake of ship above little puff of cloud whirled like dispersing smoke three four people on beach be staring up with interrogative face towards point of unexpected report be boot waiter four young men in blazer came rushing out behind shout came from window door sort of worrying people came into sight agape for time stood there too overwhelmed by new development to think of people at first be too stunned to see thing a definite disaster be just stunned a man be by accidental violent blow be only afterwards begin to appreciate specific injury good lord felt a though somebody be pouring funk out of can down back of neck leg became feeble have got first intimation of what disaster meant for there be that confounded boy sky high be utterly left there be gold in coffee room only possession on earth how must work out general effect be of gigantic unmanageable confusion say said voice of little man behind say know wheeled about there be twenty thirty people sort of irregular investment of people bombarding with dumb interrogation with infinite doubt suspicion felt compulsion of eye intolerably groaned aloud cant shouted tell cant im not equal to must puzzle be damned to gesticulated convulsively receded step a though have threatened made bolt through into hotel charged back into coffee room rang bell furiously gripped waiter a entered dye hear shouted get help carry bar up to room right away failed to understand shouted raved at scared looking little old man in green apron appeared further two of young men in flannel made dash at commandeered service a soon a gold be in room felt free to quarrel now get out shouted of get out if dont want to see man go mad before eye helped waiter by shoulder a hesitated in doorway then a soon a have door locked on tore off little man clothes again shied right left got into bed forthwith there lay swearing panting cooling for very long time at last be calm enough to get out of bed ring up round eyed waiter for flannel nightshirt soda whisky good cigar thing being procured after exasperating delay drove several time to bell locked door again proceeded very deliberately to look entire situation in face net result of great experiment presented a absolute failure be rout be sole survivor be absolute collapse be final disaster there be nothing for to save a much a must in way of prospect from dbcle at one fatal crowning blow vague resolution of return recovery have vanished intention of going back to moon of getting sphereful of gold afterwards of having fragment of cavorite analysed so recovering great secret perhaps finally even of recovering cavors body idea vanished altogether be sole survivor be think that going to bed be one of luckiest idea have ever have in emergency really believe must either have got loose headed done fatal indiscreet thing there locked in secure from interruption must think out position in bearing make arrangement at leisure of course be quite clear to what have happened to boy have crawled into sphere meddled with stud shut cavorite window gone up be highly improbable have screwed in manhole stopper even if have chance be thousand to one against getting back be fairly evident that must gravitate with bale to somewhere near middle of sphere remain there so cease to be legitimate terrestrial interest however remarkable might seem to inhabitant of remote quarter of space very speedily convinced on point a for responsibility might have in matter more reflected upon that clearer became that if only kept quiet about thing need not trouble about if be faced by sorrowing parent demanding lost boy have merely to demand lost sphere ask what meant at first have have vision of weeping parent guardian sort of complication now saw that simply have to keep mouth shut nothing in way must arise indeed more lay smoked thought more evident became wisdom of impenetrability be within right of british citizen provided doe not commit damage indecorum to appear suddenly wherever plea a ragged filthy a plea with amount of virgin gold see fit to encumber one have right at to hinder detain in procedure formulated that at last to myself repeated over a sort of private magna charta of liberty once have put that issue on one side must take up consider in equable manner certain consideration have scarcely dared to think of before namely arising out of circumstance of bankruptcy now looking at matter calmly at leisure must see that if only suppressed identity by temporary assumption of le well known name if retained two month beard have grown upon risk of annoyance from spiteful creditor to whom have already alluded became very small indeed from to definite course of rational worldly action be plain sailing be amazingly petty doubt what be there remaining for to do did be resolved must keep level right side up ordered up writing material addressed letter to new romney bank nearest waiter informed telling manager wished to open account with requesting to send two trustworthy person properly authenticated in cab with good horse to fetch hundredweight of gold with happened to be encumbered signed letter blake seemed to to be thoroughly respectable sort of name done got folkestone blue book picked out outfitter asked to send cutter to measure for drab tweed suit ordering at same time valise dressing bag brown boot shirt hat to fit so forth from watchmaker also ordered watch letter being despatched have up a good lunch a hotel must give then lay smoking cigar a calm ordinary a possible until in accordance with instruction two duly authenticated clerk came from bank weighed took away gold after pulled clothes over ear in order to drown knocking went very comfortably to sleep went to sleep doubt be prosaic thing for first man back from moon to do can imagine that young imaginative reader will find behaviour disappointing be horribly fatigued bothered confound what else be there to do there certainly be not remotest chance of being believed if have told story then must certainly have subjected to intolerable annoyance went to sleep when at last woke up again be ready to face world a have always be accustomed to face since came to year of discretion so got away to italy there be be writing story if world will not have a fact then world may take a fiction be concern of mine now that account be finished be amazed to think how completely adventure be gone done with everybody belief that cavor be not very brilliant scientific experimenter who blew up house at lympne explain bang followed arrival at littlestone by reference to experiment with explosive be going on continually at government establishment of lydd two mile away must confess that hitherto have not acknowledged share in disappearance of master tommy simmons be little boy name that perhaps may prove difficult item of corroboration to explain away account for appearance in rag with two bar of indisputable gold upon littlestone beach in various ingenious way doesnt worry what think of say have strung thing together to avoid being questioned too closely a to source of wealth must like to see man who must invent story must hold together like one well must take a fiction there be have told story now suppose have to take up worry of terrestrial life again even if one have be to moon one have still to earn living so be working here at amalfi on scenario of play sketched before cavor came walking into world be trying to piece life together a be before ever saw must confess that find hard to keep mind on play when moonshine come into room be full moon here last night be out on pergola for hour staring away at shining blankness hide so much imagine table chair trestle bar of gold confound if only one must hit on cavorite again thing like doesnt come twice in life here be little better off than be at lympne be cavor have committed suicide in more elaborate way than human being ever did before so story close a finally completely a dream fit in so little with other thing of life so much of be so utterly remote from human experience leaping eating breathing weightless time indeed there be moment when in spite of moon gold do more than half believe that whole thing be dream xxii astonishing communication of mr julius wendigee when have finished account of return to earth at littlestone wrote end made flourish threw pen aside fully believing that whole story of first men in moon be done not only have done have placed manuscript in hand of literary agent have permitted to be sold have seen greater portion of appear in strand magazine be setting to work again upon scenario of play have commenced at lympne before realised that end be not yet then following from amalfi to algiers there reached be now about six month ago one of most astounding communication have ever be fated to receive briefly informed that mr julius wendigee dutch electrician who have be experimenting with certain apparatus akin to apparatus used by mr tesla in america in hope of discovering method of communication with mar be receiving day by day curiously fragmentary message in english be indisputably emanating from mr cavor in moon at first thought thing be elaborate practical joke by one who have seen manuscript of narrative answered mr wendigee jestingly replied in manner put such suspicion altogether aside in state of inconceivable excitement hurried from algiers to little observatory upon st gothard in be working in presence of record appliance above of message from cavor be coming to hand lingering doubt vanished decided at once to accept proposal made to remain with assisting to take down record from day to day endeavouring with to send message back to moon cavor learnt be not only alive free in midst of almost inconceivable community of ant like being ant men in blue darkness of lunar cave be lamed seemed otherwise in quite good health in better health distinctly said than usually enjoyed on earth have have fever have left no bad effect curiously enough seemed to be labouring under conviction be dead in moon crater lost in deep of space message began to be received by mr wendigee when gentleman be engaged in quite different investigation reader will doubt recall little excitement began century arising out of announcement by mr nikola tesla american electrical celebrity that have received message from mar announcement renewed attention to fact have long be familiar to scientific people namely that from unknown source in space wave of electro magnetic disturbance entirely similar to used by signor marconi for wireless telegraphy be constantly reaching earth besides mr tesla quite number of other observer have be engaged in perfecting apparatus for receiving recording vibration though few must go so far a to consider actual message from extra terrestrial sender among few however must certainly count mr wendigee ever since have devoted almost entirely to subject being man of ample mean have erected observatory on flank of monte rosa in position singularly adapted in way for such observation scientific attainment must admit be not great so far a enable to judge mr wendigees contrivance for detecting recording disturbance in electro magnetic condition of space be singularly original ingenious by happy combination of circumstance be set up in operation about two month before cavor made first attempt to call up earth consequently have fragment of communication even from beginning unhappily be only fragment most momentous of thing that have to tell humanity instruction be for making of cavorite if indeed ever transmitted have throbbed away unrecorded into space never succeeded in getting response back to cavor be unable to tell therefore what have received what have missed indeed did certainly know that one on earth be really aware of effort to reach persistence displayed in sending eighteen long description of lunar affair a must be if have complete show how much mind must have turned back towards native planet since left two year ago can imagine how amazed mr wendigee must have be when discovered record of electro magnetic disturbance interlaced by cavors straightforward english mr wendigee knew nothing of wild journey moonward suddenly english out of void be well reader must understand condition under must seem message be sent somewhere within moon cavor certainly have access for time to considerable amount of electrical apparatus must seem rigged up perhaps furtively transmitting arrangement of marconi type be able to operate at irregular interval sometimes for only hour so sometimes for three four hour at stretch at time transmitted earthward message regardless of fact that relative position of moon point upon earth surface be constantly altering a consequence of of necessary imperfection of recording instrument communication come go in record in extremely fitful manner becomes blurred fade out in mysterious altogether exasperating way added to be fact that be not expert operator have partly forgotten never completely mastered code in general use a became fatigued dropped word misspelt in curious manner altogether have probably lost quite half of communication made much have be damaged broken partly effaced in abstract follows reader must be prepared therefore for considerable amount of break hiatus change of topic mr wendigee be collaborating in complete annotated edition of cavor record hope to publish together with detailed account of instrument employed beginning with first volume in january next will be full scientific report of be only popular first transcript here give at least sufficient to complete story have told to give broad outline of state of other world so near so akin yet so dissimilar to own xxiii abstract of six message first received from mr cavor two earlier message of mr cavor may very well be reserved for larger volume simply tell with greater brevity with difference in several detail be interesting not of vital importance bare fact of making of sphere departure from world throughout cavor speaks of a man who be dead with curious change of temper a approach landing on moon poor bedford say of poor young man blame for inducing young man by mean well equipped for such adventure to leave planet on be indisputably fitted to succeed on so precarious mission think underrates part energy practical capacity played in bringing about realisation of theoretical sphere arrived say with more account of passage through space than if have made journey of common occurrence in railway train then becomes increasingly unfair to unfair indeed to extent must not have expected in man trained in search for truth looking back over previously written account of thing must insist have be altogether juster to cavor than have be to have extenuated little suppressed nothing account be speedily became apparent that entire strangeness of circumstance surroundings great loss of weight attenuated highly oxygenated air consequent exaggeration of result of muscular effort rapid development of weird plant from obscure spore lurid sky be exciting companion unduly on moon character seemed to deteriorate became impulsive rash quarrelsome in little while folly in devouring gigantic vesicle consequent intoxication led to capture by selenites before have have slightest opportunity of properly observing way say observe nothing of own concession to same vesicle go on from point to say that came to difficult passage with bedford mistaking certain gesture of theirs pretty gesture be gave way to panic violence ran amuck killed three perforce have to flee with after outrage subsequently fought with number who endeavoured to bar way slew seven eight more say much for tolerance of being on recapture be not instantly slain made way to exterior separated in crater of arrival to increase chance of recovering sphere presently came upon body of selenites led by two who be curiously different even in form from of have seen hitherto with larger head smaller body much more elaborately wrapped about after evading for time fell into crevasse cut head rather badly displaced patella finding crawling very painful decided to surrender if must still permit to do so did perceiving helpless condition carried with again into moon of bedford have heard seen nothing more so far a can gather have selenite night overtook in crater else be more probable found sphere desiring to steal march upon made off with only fear to find uncontrollable to meet more lingering fate in outer space with cavor dismisses go on to more interesting topic dislike idea of seeming to use position a editor to deflect story in own interest be obliged to protest here against turn give occurrence say nothing about gasping message on blood stained paper in told attempted to tell very different story dignified self surrender be altogether new view of affair have come to must insist since began to feel secure among lunar people a for stealing march conception be quite willing to let reader decide between on what have before know be not model man have made pretence to be be that however be sum of wrong from point can edit cavor with untroubled mind for mention more must seem selenites who have come upon carried to point in interior down great shaft by mean of what describes a sort of balloon gather from rather confused passage in describes from number of chance allusion hint in other subsequent message that great shaft be one of enormous system of artificial shaft run from what be called lunar crater downwards for very nearly hundred mile towards central portion of satellite shaft communicate by transverse tunnel throw out abysmal cavern expand into great globular place whole of moon substance for hundred mile inward indeed be mere sponge of rock partly say cavor sponginess be natural very largely be due to enormous industry of selenites in past enormous circular mound of excavated rock earth be that form great circle about tunnel known to earthly astronomer misled by false analogy a volcano be down shaft took in sort of balloon speaks of at first into inky blackness then into region of continually increasing phosphorescence cavors despatch show to be curiously regardless of detail for scientific man gather that light be due to stream cascade of water doubt containing phosphorescent organism flowed ever more abundantly downward towards central sea a descended say selenites also became luminous at last far below saw a be lake of heatless fire water of central sea glowing eddying in strange perturbation like luminous blue milk be just on boil lunar sea say cavor in later passage be not stagnant ocean solar tide sends in perpetual flow around lunar axis strange storm boiling rushing of water occur at time cold wind thunderings ascend out of into busy way of great ant hill above be only when water be in motion that give out light in rare season of calm be black commonly when one see water rise fall in oily swell flake big raft of shining bubbly foam drift with sluggish faintly glowing current selenites navigate cavernous strait lagoon in little willow boat of canoe like shape even before journey to gallery about grand lunar who be master of moon be permitted to make brief excursion on water cavern passage be naturally very tortuous large proportion of way be known only to expert pilot among fisherman not infrequently selenites be lost for ever in labyrinth in remoter recess be told strange creature lurk of terrible dangerous creature science of moon have be unable to exterminate there be particularly rapha inextricable mass of clutching tentacle one hack to piece only to multiply tzee darting creature be never seen so subtly suddenly doe slay give gleam of description be reminded on excursion of what have read of mammoth cave if only have have yellow flambeau instead of pervading blue light solid looking boatman with oar instead of scuttle faced selenite working engine at back of canoe must have imagined have suddenly got back to earth rock about be very various sometimes black sometimes pale blue veined once flashed glittered a though have come into mine of sapphire below one saw ghostly phosphorescent fish flash vanish in hardly le phosphorescent deep then presently long ultramarine vista down turgid stream of one of channel of traffic landing stage then perhaps glimpse up enormous crowded shaft of one of vertical way in one great place heavy with glistening stalactite number of boat be fishing went alongside one of watched long armed fishing selenites winding in net be little hunchbacked insect with very strong arm short bandy leg crinkled face mask a pulled at net seemed heaviest thing have come upon in moon be loaded with weight doubt of gold took long time to draw for in water larger more edible fish lurk deep fish in net came up like blue moonrise blaze of darting tossing blue among catch be many tentaculate evil eyed black thing ferociously active whose appearance greeted with shriek twitter with quick nervous movement hacked to piece by mean of little hatchet dissevered limb continued to lash writhe in vicious manner afterwards when fever have hold of dreamt again again of bitter furious creature rising so vigorous active out of unknown sea be most active malignant thing of living creature have yet seen in world inside moon surface of sea must be very nearly two hundred mile if not more below level of moon exterior city of moon lie learnt immediately above central sea in such cavernous space artificial gallery a have described communicate with exterior by enormous vertical shaft open invariably in what be called by earthly astronomer crater of moon lid covering one such aperture have already seen during wandering have preceded capture upon condition of le central portion of moon have not yet arrived at very precise knowledge there be enormous system of cavern in mooncalves shelter during night there be abattoir like in one of be that bedford fought with selenite butcher have since seen balloon laden with meat descending out of upper dark have a yet scarcely learnt a much of thing a zulu in london must learn about british corn supply in same time be clear however that vertical shaft vegetation of surface must play essential rle in ventilating keeping fresh atmosphere of moon at one time particularly on first emergence from prison there be certainly cold wind blowing down shaft later there be kind of sirocco upward corresponded with fever for at end of about three week fell ill of indefinable sort of fever in spite of sleep quinine tabloid very fortunately have brought in pocket remained ill fretting miserably almost to time when be taken into presence of grand lunar who be master of moon will not dilate on wretchedness of condition remark during day of ill health go on with great amplitude with detail omit here temperature concludes kept abnormally high for long time lost desire for food have stagnant waking interval sleep tormented by dream at one phase be remember so weak a to be earth sick almost hysterical longed almost intolerably for colour to break everlasting blue reverts again presently to topic of sponge caught lunar atmosphere be told by astronomer physicist that tell be in absolute accordance with what be already known of moon condition have earthly astronomer have courage imagination to push home bold induction say mr wendigee might have foretold almost everything that cavor have to say of general structure of moon know now pretty certainly that moon earth be not so much satellite primary a smaller greater sister made out of one mass consequently made of same material since density of moon be only three fifth that of earth there can be nothing for that be hollowed out by great system of cavern there be necessity said sir jabez flap fr that most entertaining exponent of facetious side of star that must ever have gone to moon to find out such easy inference point pun with allusion to gruyre certainly might have announced knowledge of hollowness of moon before if moon be hollow then apparent absence of air water be of course quite easily explained sea lie within at bottom of cavern air travel through great sponge of gallery in accordance with simple physical law cavern of moon on whole be very windy place a sunlight come round moon air in outer gallery on side be heated pressure increase flow out on exterior mingles with evaporating air of crater where plant remove carbonic acid while greater portion flow round through gallery to replace shrinking air of cooling side that sunlight have left there be therefore constant eastward breeze in air of outer gallery up flow during lunar day up shaft complicated of course very greatly by varying shape of gallery ingenious contrivance of selenite mind xxiv natural history of selenites message of cavor from sixth up to sixteenth be for most part so much broken abound so in repetition that scarcely form consecutive narrative will be given in full of course in scientific report here will be far more convenient to continue simply to abstract quote a in former chapter have subjected word to keen critical scrutiny own brief memory impression of lunar thing have be of inestimable help in interpreting what must otherwise have be impenetrably dark naturally a living being interest centre far more upon strange community of lunar insect in be living must seem a honoured guest than upon mere physical condition of world have already made clear think that selenites saw resembled man in maintaining erect attitude in having four limb have compared general appearance of head jointing of limb to of insect have mentioned too peculiar consequence of smaller gravitation of moon on fragile slightness cavor confirms upon point call animal though of course fall under division of classification of earthly creature point out insect type of anatomy have fortunately for men never exceeded relatively very small size on earth largest terrestrial insect living extinct a matter of fact measure in in length here against lesser gravitation of moon creature certainly a much insect a vertebrate seems to have be able to attain to human ultrahuman dimension doe not mention ant throughout allusion ant be continually being brought before mind in sleepless activity in intelligence social organisation in structure more particularly in fact that display in addition to two form male female form almost other animal posse number of other sexless creature worker soldier like differing from one in structure character power use yet member of same specie for selenites also have great variety of form of course be not only colossally greater in size than ant also in cavors opinion at least in intelligence morality social wisdom be colossally greater than men instead of four five different form of ant be found there be almost innumerably different form of selenite have endeavoured to indicate very considerable difference observable in such selenites of outer crust a happened to encounter difference in size proportion be certainly a wide a difference between most widely separated race of men such difference a saw fade absolutely to nothing in comparison with huge distinction of cavor tell must seem exterior selenites saw be indeed mostly engaged in kindred occupation mooncalf herd butcher fleshers like within moon practically unsuspected by there be seems number of other sort of selenite differing in size differing in relative size of part to part differing in power appearance yet not different specie of creature only different form of one specie retaining through variation certain common likeness mark specific unity moon be indeed sort of vast ant hill only instead of there being only four five sort of ant there be many hundred different sort of selenite almost gradation between one sort must seem discovery came upon cavor very speedily infer rather than learn from narrative that be captured by mooncalf herd under direction of other selenites who have larger brain case head very much shorter leg finding must not walk even under goad carried into darkness crossed narrow plank like bridge may have be identical bridge have refused put down in something must have seemed at first to be sort of lift be balloon have certainly be absolutely invisible to in darkness what have seemed to mere plank walking into void be really doubt passage of gangway in descended towards constantly more luminous cavern of moon at first descended in silence save for twitterings of selenites then into stir of windy movement in little while profound blackness have made eye so sensitive that began to see more more of thing about at last vague took shape illustration carried into darkness conceive enormous cylindrical space say cavor in seventh message quarter of mile across perhaps very dimly lit at first then brighter with big platform twisting down side in spiral vanishes at last below in blue profundity lit even more brightly one must not tell how why think of well of very largest spiral staircase lift shaft that have ever looked down magnify by hundred imagine at twilight seen through blue glass imagine looking down that only imagine also that feel extraordinarily light have got rid of giddy feeling might have on earth will have first condition of impression round enormous shaft imagine broad gallery running in much steeper spiral than must be credible on earth forming steep road protected from gulf only by little parapet that vanishes at last in perspective couple of mile below looking up saw very fellow of downward vision have of course effect of looking into very steep cone wind be blowing down shaft far above fancy heard growing fainter fainter bellowing of mooncalves be being driven down again from evening pasturage on exterior up down spiral gallery be scattered numerous moon people pallid faintly luminous being regarding appearance busied on unknown errand fancied flake of snow came drifting down on icy breeze then falling like snowflake little figure little man insect clinging to

found pulled down to level with great crowd of selenites who jostled to see be incredible crowd suddenly violently there be forced upon attention vast amount of difference there be amongst being of moon indeed there seemed not two alike in that jostling multitude differed in shape differed in size rang horrible change on theme of selenite form bulged overhung ran about among foot of fellow of

respectful head attention be directed to enhaloed supreme intelligence hovered above at first a peered into radiating glow quintessential brain looked very much like opaque featureless bladder with

easily between without turning back on grand lunar tsi puff took up position behind dexterous usher sidled sideways towards keeping full face to presence seated turkish fashion phi oo tsi puff also knelt down above there came pause eye of nearer court went from to grand lunar came back to hissing piping of expectation passed across hidden multitude below ceased that humming ceased for first last time in experience moon be silent became aware of faint wheezy noise grand lunar be addressing be like rubbing of finger upon pane of glass watched attentively for time then glanced at alert phi oo felt amidst slender being ridiculously thick fleshy solid head jaw black hair eye went back to grand lunar have ceased attendant be busy shining superficies be glistening running with cooling spray phi oo meditated through interval consulted tsi puff then began piping recognisable english at first little nervously so that be not very clear mm grand lunar wish to say wish to say gather be mm men that be man from planet earth wish to say that welcome welcome wish to learn learn if may use word state of world reason why came to paused be about to reply when resumed proceeded to remark of drift be not very clear though be inclined to think be intended to be complimentary told that earth be to moon what sun be to earth that selenites desired very greatly to learn about earth men then told doubt in compliment also relative magnitude diameter of earth moon perpetual wonder speculation with selenites have regarded planet meditated with downcast eye decided to reply that men too have wondered what might lie in moon have judged dead little recking of such magnificence a have seen that day grand lunar in token of recognition caused long blue ray to rotate in very confusing manner about great hall ran piping whispering rustling of report of what have said then proceeded to put to phi oo number of inquiry be easier to answer understood explained that lived on surface of earth that air sea be outside globe latter part indeed already knew from astronomical specialist be very anxious to have more detailed information of what called extraordinary state of affair for from solidity of earth there have always be disposition to regard a uninhabitable endeavoured first to ascertain extreme of temperature to earth being be exposed be deeply interested by descriptive treatment of cloud rain imagination be assisted by fact that lunar atmosphere in outer gallery of night side be not infrequently very foggy seemed inclined to marvel that did not find sunlight too intense for eye be interested in attempt to explain that sky be tempered to bluish colour through refraction of air though doubt if clearly understood that explained how iris of human eye can contract pupil save delicate internal structure from excess of sunlight be allowed to approach within few foot of presence in order that structure might be seen led to comparison of lunar terrestrial eye former be not only excessively sensitive to such light a men can see can also see heat difference in temperature within moon render object visible to iris be quite new organ to grand lunar for time amused by flashing ray into face watching pupil contract a consequence be dazzled blinded for little time in spite of discomfort found something reassuring by insensible degree in rationality of business of question answer must shut eye think of answer almost forget that grand lunar have face when have descended again to proper place grand lunar asked how sheltered from heat storm expounded to art of building furnishing here wandered into misunderstanding cross purpose due largely must admit to looseness of expression for long time have great difficulty in making understand nature of house to attendant selenites seemed doubt most whimsical thing in world that men must build house when might descend into excavation additional complication be introduced by attempt made to explain that men have originally begun home in cave that be now taking railway many establishment beneath surface here think desire for intellectual completeness betrayed there be also considerable tangle due to equally unwise attempt on part to explain about mine dismissing topic at last in incomplete state grand lunar inquired what did with interior of globe tide of twittering piping swept into remotest corner of great assembly when be at last made clear that men know absolutely nothing of content of world upon immemorial generation of ancestor have be evolved three time have to repeat of mile of substance between earth centre men knew only to depth of mile very vaguely understood grand lunar to ask why have come to moon seeing have scarcely touched own planet yet did not trouble at time to proceed to explanation being too anxious to pursue detail of mad inversion of idea reverted to question of weather tried to describe perpetually changing sky snow frost hurricane when night come asked be not cold told be colder than by day doe not atmosphere freeze told not that be never cold enough for because night be so short not even liquefy be about to say then occurred to that one part at least of atmosphere water vapour of doe sometimes liquefy form dew sometimes freeze form frost process perfectly analogous to freezing of external atmosphere of moon during longer night made clear on point from that grand lunar went on to speak with of sleep for need of sleep come so regularly twenty four hour to thing be part also of earthly inheritance on moon rest only at rare interval after exceptional exertion then tried to describe to soft splendour of summer night from passed to description of animal prowl by night sleep by day told of lion tiger here seemed a though have come to deadlock for save in water there be creature in moon not absolutely domestic subject to will so have be for immemorial year have monstrous water creature evil beast idea of anything strong large existing outside in night be very difficult for record be here too broken to transcribe for space of perhaps twenty word more talked with attendant a suppose upon strange superficiality unreasonableness of man who life on mere surface of world creature of wave wind chance of space who can not even unite to overcome beast prey upon kind yet who dare to invade planet during aside sat thinking then at desire told of different sort of men searched with question for sort of work have same sort of men who think who governs gave outline of democratic method when have done ordered cooling spray upon brow then requested to repeat explanation conceiving something have miscarried do not do different thing then said phi oo admitted be thinker official hunted be mechanic artist toiler rule said have not different shape to fit to different duty none that can see said except perhaps for clothes mind perhaps differ little reflected mind must differ great deal said grand lunar must want to do same thing in order to bring into closer harmony with preconception said that surmise be right be hidden in brain said difference be there perhaps if one must see mind soul of men must be a varied unequal a selenites there be great men small men men who must reach out far wide men who must go swiftly noisy trumpet minded men men who must remember without thinking record be indistinct for three word interrupted to recall to previous statement said men rule pressed to certain extent said made fear denser fog with explanation reached out to salient fact do mean asked that there be grand earthly thought of several people assured finally there be none explained that such autocrat emperor a have tried upon earth have usually ended in drink vice violence that large influential section of people of earth to belonged anglo saxon did not mean to try sort of thing again at grand lunar be even more amazed how do keep even such wisdom a have asked explained to way helped limited word omitted here probably brain with library of book explained to how science be growing by united labour of innumerable little men on that made comment save that be evident have mastered much in spite of social savagery must not have come to moon yet contrast be very marked with selenites grew changed mankind stored knowledge about remained brute equipped said here there be short piece of record indistinct then caused to describe how went about earth of ours described to railway ship for time must not understand that have have use of steam only one hundred year when did be clearly amazed may mention a singular thing that selenites use year to count by just a do on earth though can make nothing of numeral system however doe not matter because phi oo understands ours from went on to tell that mankind have dwelt in city only for nine ten thousand year that be still not united in one brotherhood under many different form of government astonished grand lunar very much when be made clear to at first thought referred merely to administrative area state empire be still rawest sketch of what order will day be said so came to tell at point length of record probably represents thirty forty word be totally illegible grand lunar be greatly impressed by folly of men in clinging to inconvenience of diverse tongue want to communicate yet not to communicate said then for long time questioned closely concerning war be at first perplexed incredulous mean to say asked seeking confirmation that run about over surface of world world whose rich have scarcely begun to scrape killing one for beast to eat told be perfectly correct asked for particular to assist imagination ship poor little city get injured asked found waste of property convenience seemed to impress almost a much a killing tell more said grand lunar make see picture can not conceive thing so for space though something told story of earthly war told of first order ceremony of war of warning ultimatum marwilling marching of troop gave idea of manuvres position battle joined told of siege assault of starvation hardship in trench of sentinel freezing in snow told of rout surprise desperate last stand faint hope pitiless pursuit of fugitive dead upon field told too of past of invasion massacre of hun tartar war of mahomet caliph of crusade a went on phi oo translated selenites cooed murmured in steadily intensified emotion told ironclad must fire shot of ton twelve mile go through ft of iron how must steer torpedo under water went on to describe maxim gun in action what must imagine of battle of colenso grand lunar be so incredulous that interrupted translation of what have said in order to have verification of account particularly doubted description of men cheering rejoicing a went into battle surely like translated phi oo assured men of race considered battle most glorious experience of life at whole assembly be stricken with amazement what good be war asked grand lunar sticking to theme oh a for good said thins population why must there be need there came pause cooling spray impinged upon brow then spoke again at point series of undulation have be apparent a perplexing complication a far back a cavors description of silence fell before first speaking of grand lunar become confusingly predominant in record undulation be evidently result of radiation proceeding from lunar source persistent approximation to alternating signal of cavor be curiously suggestive of operator deliberately seeking to mix in with message render illegible at first be small regular so that with little care loss of very few word have be able to disentangle cavors message then become broad larger then suddenly be irregular with irregularity give effect at last of one scribbling through line of writing for long time nothing can be made of madly zigzagging trace then quite abruptly interruption cease leaf few word clear then resume continues for rest of message completely obliterating whatever cavor be attempting to transmit why if be indeed deliberate intervention selenites must have preferred to let cavor go on transmitting message in happy ignorance of obliteration of record when be clearly quite in power much more easy convenient for to stop proceeding at time be problem to can contribute nothing thing seems to have happened so be can say last rag of description of grand lunar begin in mid sentence interrogated very closely upon secret be able in little while to get to understanding with at last to elucidate what have be puzzle to ever since realised vastness of science namely how be have never discovered cavorite find know of a theoretical substance have always regarded a practical impossibility because for reason there be helium in moon helium across last letter of helium slash resumption of obliterating trace note that word secret for on that alone base interpretation of message follows last message a mr wendigee now believe to be that be ever likely to send xxvi last message cavor sent to earth in unsatisfactory manner penultimate message of cavor dy out one seems to see away there in blue obscurity amidst apparatus intently signalling to last unaware of curtain of confusion that drop between unaware too of final danger even then must have be creeping upon disastrous want of vulgar common sense have utterly betrayed have talked of war have talked of strength irrational violence of men of insatiable aggression tireless futility of conflict have filled whole moon world with impression of race then think be plain that made most fatal admission that upon alone hung possibility at least for long time of further men reaching moon line cold inhuman reason of moon must take seems plain enough to suspicion of then perhaps sudden sharp realisation of must have come to one imago going about moon with remorse of fatal indiscretion growing in mind during certain time be inclined to guess grand lunar be deliberating new situation for time cavor may have gone a free a ever have gone obstacle of sort prevented getting to electro magnetic apparatus again after message have just given for day received nothing perhaps be having fresh audience trying to evade previous admission who can hope to guess then suddenly like cry in night like cry be followed by stillness came last message be briefest fragment broken

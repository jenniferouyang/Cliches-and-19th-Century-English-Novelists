burst into tear a turned away from former guardian part one chapter seventeen cabinet council resolve to set up a gentleman having a legitimate pretension to rank of one a many others led little sobbing girl by hand proceeded for time in silence be not until gained high road that timothy interrupted reverie by observing japhet have at made up mind what will do have be reflecting timothy have lost great deal of time original intention with left london have be almost forgotten must be so no longer now have resolved that a soon a have placed poor little girl in safety will prosecute search never be diverted from can not agree with that have lost time japhet have very little money when started upon expedition now have sufficient to enable to prosecute plan for long time question be in what direction quitted london travelled west in imitation a thought of wise men with deference in opinion be like two fool have be thinking upon point also tim agree with expect from several cause know a well a do to find father among higher class of society path took when started have led into very lowest appears to that can not do better than retrace step have mean now to appear a gentleman to mix in good company london be very best place for to repair to be precisely opinion japhet with one single exception will mention to first tell have calculated what joint purse may amount to must be very considerable sum have not examined packet in be money melchior have given at parting now opened found to surprise that there be bank note to amount of one hundred pound felt that have given large sum that might assist in fleta expense with sum said can not have much le than two hundred fifty pound have more than sixty said timothy really profession be not unprofitable replied laughing recollect tim that have outlay public provided with food lodging cost nothing have have tax to pay at same time have taxed folly credulity to great extent be true japhet although be glad to have money be not sorry that have abandoned profession be tim if please will forget altogether tell be exception be about to make simply although upwards of three hundred pound may be great deal of money yet if be to support character appearance of gentleman will not last for ever for instance must have valet what expense will be clothes too will soon lose rank station in society without obtain situation under government must make last a long a can timothy trust to good fortune to assist be very well japhet have rather trust to own prudence now hear have to say will be a much assisted by trusty valet a by other mean will a gentleman be only expense incumbrance a valet will be able to play into hand at same time more than one expense will be avoided with leave therefore will take proper situation put on livery thereby make myself of greatest use must not help acknowledging advantage to be derived from proposal of timothy did not like to accept be very kind of timothy replied can only look upon a friend equal there be right be wrong in same breath be right in looking upon a friend japhet must be still more right in allowing to prove friendship a propose be wrong in looking upon a equal for be not so either in personal appearance education anything else be foundling be true be christened after abraham newland after workhouse pump be gentleman foundling presenting with fifty pound note good clothes made appearance in rag misery if find parent will rise in world if find mine will in probability have reason to be proud of therefore must insist upon having own choice in part be to play in drama will prove to that be right to choose forget that when started object be to search after father told mine must be to look after mother have selected high life a expected sphere in be to be found select low life a in be most likely to discover object of search so perceive continued tim laughing that must arrange so a to suit view of without parting company do hunt among bag wig amber headed cane silk satin will burrow among tag tassel dimity mob cap probably will succeed in object of search leave to hunt in drawing room while ferret in kitchen may throw on sofa exclaim who be father ' will sit in cook lap ask if may happen to be mother sally of timothy made even fleta laugh after little more remonstrance consented that must perform part of valet indeed more reflected upon greater appeared advantage might accrue from arrangement by time that point have be settled have arrived at town to directed step took up quarter at inn of moderate pretension of very great external cleanliness first object be to find out fitting asylum for little fleta landlady be buxom good tempered young woman gave little girl into charge while timothy went out on survey have made up mind to put to good not very expensive school if such be to be found in vicinity must have preferred taking with to london be aware how much more expensive must be to provide for there a distance from metropolis be twenty mile must easily run down to see occasionally desired little girl to call brother a such intended to be to in future not to answer question might put to there be however little occasion for caution for fleta be a before observed very unlike child in general then went out with timothy to look for tailor might order clothes a what have on be not either of very best taste in very best condition walked up main street soon fell in with tailor shop over be written in large letter feodor shneider tailor to royal highness prince of darmstadt will do japhet said timothy pointing to announcement why yes replied how deuce prince of darmstadt must have employed man in small country town a tailor be to rather puzzle perhaps made clothes when be in germany replied tim perhaps did however will have honour of making mine entered shop ordered suit of most fashionable clothes choosing colour being very minute in direction to foreman who measured a be leaving shop master judging by appearance be certainly not exactly that of gentleman ventured to observe that be customary with gentleman whom have not honour of knowing to leave deposit although very proposal be

order livery until must appear in own clothes be promised on afternoon of next day there be however several other article to be purchased such a trunk portmanteau hat glove etcetera procured then went back to inn on return ordered dinner fleta be certainly clad in best frock bad be best landlady who must extract little from child must not imagine who must be have however allowed to see more than sufficient money to warrant expense so far scruple be although curiosity be not removed that evening have long conversation with fleta told that be to part that must go to school must very often come down to see at first be inconsolable at idea reasoned with gentle intelligent creature acknowledged that be right next day clothes came home dressed without flattery japhet said timothy do look very much like gentleman fleta smiled said same thought so too said nothing putting on hat glove accompanied by timothy descended to go out order tim livery a well a fitout for fleta after be out in street discovered that have left handkerchief returned to fetch landlady seeing gentleman about to enter inn made very low courtesy be not until looked hard at that recognised then be satisfied be

child wept bitterly at separation must with difficulty detach little arm from neck felt when left a if have parted with only valuable object to on earth be now ready timothy did not a yet assume new clothes must have appeared strange that one who sat at table must afterwards put on livery a in small town there be always plenty of scandal for fleta sake if for other reason be deferred until arrival in london wishing landlady good bye who really believed must have given up bill to have known who must possibly be got on outside of stage coach in evening arrived at metropolis have be

for value too much sterling gold for simple effect produced very much doubted whether like must be found next morning fleta be too much affected at parting with to enter into much conversation asked whether have recollected anything replied that have cried night at thought of separation cautioned to be very careful of chain gave same caution to schoolmistress after have left town regretted that

rose promised to give particular a soon a be known to bowed made exit to one who be in sober sens there certainly be not important information gained to be evident that mr de benyon who be general in army be to be interrogated have almost made up mind to set off for calcutta part two chapter eighteen affront irish gentleman make handsome apology be accepted before have gained own room informed mr cophagus who have just returned from visit to maiden aunt house of what have passed ca see anything in japhet wild goose chase who told oh pleggit men sad liar de benyon not name depend upon stuff so on when reflected must acknowledge that worthy apothecary might be right be running after shadow be only in occasional fit of despondency soon rallied be a sanguine a ever undecided how to proceed annoyed by what cophagus have said quitted hotel to walk out in very good humour a went out perceived agent mcdermott speaking to people in bar sight of reminded of what for moment have forgotten be to ascertain whether melchior sir henry de clare be one same person a passed crossing man in tattered habiliment who be sweeping asked for alms being in very charitable humour walked on followed pestering so much that gave tap with cane in hand saying to be off scoundrel oh very well be off be mane by blood of o'rourkes will answer for same anyhow passed on having perambulated city of dublin for time returned to hotel few minute afterwards be told by waiter that mr o'donaghan wished to speak to have not honour of acquaintance replied may show up mr o'donaghan entered tall thick whiskered personage in shabby genteel dress evidently not made for pair of white cotton glove small stick believe have honour of spaking to gentleman who crossed over street about two hour ago upon word sir replied be so uncertain definition can hardly pretend to say whether be person mean indeed from not having pleasure of anyone acquaintance in dublin rather think there must be mistake devil bit of mistake at at for there be little bit of cane with paid friend mr o'rourke compliment over shoulder really be quite mystified sir understand will favour with explanation with pleasure in life for then will come to right understanding be crossing street gentleman particular friend of mine with broom carry for own amusement did honour to address whereupon of same little stick of yours did honour to give slight taste what do mean do refer to sweeper who be so importunate when crossed over road then by power have just hit a did be particular friend thaddeus o'rourke gentleman gentleman exclaimed with a good a true milesian blood a in ireland if think sir that because friend just for own amusement think proper to put on worst of clothes carry broom just by way of exercise to prevent becoming too lusty be therefore to be struck like hound be slight mistake be here sir be card will oblige by mentioning friend of yours with whom may settle little point necessary before meeting of two gentleman must hardly refrain from laughing at irish gentleman friend thought advisable to retain countenance dear sir replied grief to heart must have committed error in not perceiving gentility of friend have not be so careless certainly must have requested to do honour to accept shilling instead of having offered insult hope be not now too late by power be not one of harum scarum sort who must make up fight when there be occasion for a 'haviour be that of gentleman think will perhaps be better to shake hand upon forget altogether suppose now will consider that be mistake give shilling a intended to do will swear only be in so great hurry then perhaps will not object to throw in shilling for same tap with cane just to wipe off insult a be a do sin when fork out money receive absolution from padre then perhaps will not think too much if charge shilling for time trouble for carrying message between two gentleman on contrary mr o'donaghan think demand be reasonable here be money mr o'donaghan took three shilling then sir many thanks to will wish good evening mr o'rourke will know from that have absolution for whole that have offered satisfaction one gentleman must expect from so saying mr o'donaghan put hat on with firm cock pulled on glove manoeuvred stick with flourishing bow took departure have hardly dismissed gentleman be laughing to myself at ridiculous

over various cabinet belonging to old lady be full of secret drawer that in one cabinet alone have found upwards of fifty pound in various gold coin that if not well examined must probably be sold with many article of consequence remaining in a only object in ireland be to find out sir henry de clare identify really why must not have said a must have proved nothing after willingly consented to

nineteen be not content with minding own business must have hand in of others by mean put foot in then after own fashion told that a executor must retain paper pointed out to little probability there be of containing information relative to birth even allowing that person of name of de benyon did call at foundling to ask for be only supposition finally overthrew hope have be for so many day buoying up when have finished threw upon sofa in despair wished at moment have never be born still hope again rose uppermost must have given possessed to have be able to break open seal of packet have

clare be not one same person what then what then why then may find out something relative to fleta parentage nay be likely if a suppose melchior be sir henry de clare if a suppose be who be now trying to find out carry off fleta be probable that will gain information from have idea that fleta be little girl said to have died who be child of elder brother why so what interest must melchior have in stealing own niece can not tell why did nattee give necklace can not tell must hardly betray husband at event there be mystery can only be unravelled by being pulled at may learn something by meeting

be also fortunate a far a money be concerned a have reason to believe that father be very rich man of course be only child must now prepare to meet with very different person than perhaps fond anticipation of youth may have led to expect father have paternal feeling can discover have wealth wish to leave have therefore sought out be despotic violent absurd least opposition to will make furious be sorry to add be afraid that be very mean suffered severely when young from poverty own father be almost a authoritative unforgiving a now will state how be that be left at asylum when infant grandfather have procured for father commission in army soon afterwards procured lieutenancy ordered to marry young lady of large fortune whom have never seen sent for for purpose understand that be very beautiful have father seen be probable must have made objection very foolishly sent peremptory refusal for be dismissed for ever in short time afterwards father fell in love with young lady of great personal attraction supposed to posse large fortune to deceive pretended to be heir to earldom after hasty courtship ran off be married when compared note soon did be discovered that on side have nothing pay of subaltern on hers that have not one shilling father stormed called wife impostor recriminated second morning after marriage be passed in tear on side oath curse revilings on lady however appeared more sensible party of two marriage be not known have run away on pretence to visit relative be actually supposed in county town where resided that such be case why must quarrel in way ' observed edmund wished to marry fortune not may plead guilty to same duplicity have made mistake be not too late be supposed that be on visit to that be on furlough for few day did confide secret to of brother officer not one ' muttered father well then let part a if nothing have happened nobody will be wiser be equally interested in keeping secret be agreed ' father immediately consented accompanied mother to house at where be expected framed story for delay by having met very polite young man father returned to regiment thus did like two privateer who when meet engage a soon a find out mistake hoist colour sheer off by mutual consent ca say much for mother affection delicacy observed le say better japhet however be father story how to proceed appears that about two month afterwards father received letter from mother acquainting that short intercourse have be productive of certain result requesting that must take necessary step to provide for child avoid exposure that must be obliged to confess marriage by what mean contrived to avoid exposure until period of confinement know not father state that child be born in house in london by agreement be instantly put into hand that with consent of wife left at door of asylum with paper bank note from received name of newland at time have idea of reclaiming mother have for heartless a appears to have be yet mother must feel for child father regiment be then ordered out to east indie be rapidly promoted for gallantry good conduct during war in mysore territory once only have returned home on furlough then did make inquiry after not appears with view of finding out on own account from promise made mother mother what have met since yes mother went out to india on speculation passing off a single girl be very well married there be going to say however committed very splendid bigamy good heaven how totally destitute of principle father asserts that mother be freethinker japhet father have made one without religion woman have stay father be in up country during time that mother arrived be married to one of council of calcutta father say that met at ball at government house be still very handsome woman much admired when father recognised be told that be lately married to honourable mr be quite electrified must have quitted room have perceived walking up to with greatest coolness claimed a old acquaintance in england afterwards often met never adverted to what have passed between until time for departure to england on leave then sent for begged that must make inquiry after japhet did so know result on return to india found that mother have be carried off by prevailing pestilence at period father be not rich be then appointed to chief command in carnatic reaped golden harvest in return for success bravery appears a far a must obtain from that a long a mother be alive felt interest about death subsequent wealth poured upon have now induced to find out heir to whom may be bequeathed such japhet be outline of father history must point out that have feeling of affection for at present conduct of mother be ever before if be not that wish heir must almost say that feeling be of dislike may create interest in heart be true may be gratified by personal appearance will have very difficult task a will have to submit to caprice fancy be afraid that to high spirit like yours will be almost unbearable really sir begin to feel that fondest anticipation be seldom realised almost to wish have not be sought for by father be happy contented now see chance of having to congratulate on change on one two point also wish to question appears that have entered into sect denominated quaker tell candidly do subscribe heartily sincerely to doctrine be going to add be intention to remain with perceive much difficulty in tenet of sect certainly do believe to be more in accordance with christian religion than other have hesitation in asserting from knowledge of who belong to sect that generally speaking lead better life there be point connected with worship at first considered ridiculous feeling have however worn off a to quaint manner of speaking have be grossly exaggerated dress be part of religion why so japhet can reply to in word of susannah temple when made same interrogatory think peculiarity of dress be outward form be not required be put on to separate from others a proof of sincerity still discarding of dress be proof of sincerity consider to admire person be vain creed be humility be therefore outward visible sign that must act up to tenet profess be not who wear dress who be quaker in heart conduct know that when be put aside tenet of persuasion be at same time renounced therefore do consider essential mean to say that heart may be a pure faith continue a steadfast without such sign outwardly be part of creed must not choose reject none ' very well argued by little quakeress now japhet must like to put question to be very much attached to young puritan will not deny that be love sincerely doe love carry so far that must for sake continue quaker marry have asked that question at least hundred time during last twenty four hour can not decide if must dress a others do allow to do same must marry to morrow whether will ever make up mind to adhere to persuasion live die quaker for sake be quite matter be afraid not be too worldly minded fact be be in very awkward position with respect to have never acknowledged affection asked for return know love know that love like vain boy flatter leave to judge sir replied repeating to parting tete tete how have returned found in tear that certainly be very corroborative evidence tell japhet do think love well enough to abandon for sake ever will sir be too high principled too high minded might suffer greatly never must swerve from what thought be right must be fine character japhet will be in dilemma indeed appears to that trouble be now commencing instead of ending that must have be much happier where be than will be by being again brought out into world prospect be not over cheerful have awkward father to deal with will be under strong check have notion be afraid will find that notwithstanding will be once more received into society be vanity vexation of spirit be afraid be right sir replied at event will be something gained to be acknowledged to world by father of good family else may have to submit to have be sport of fortune life probably have not yet done playing with be late will now wish good night good night japhet if have intelligence will let know lady de clare address be number park street will of course go there a soon a can will sir after have written letter to friend at reading part three chapter eighteen be little jealous like immortal william bottom inclined to enact more part than one with big effort hankering after bigamy be mastered by mr masterton by own good sense returned home to reflect upon what mr masterton have told must say be not very well pleased with various information account of mother although be more distressed from character gave of father felt convinced that happiness must not be at increased by having finally attained long desired object of wish strange to say have sooner discovered father wished that have never turned up when compared peaceful happy state of existence have lately enjoyed with prospect of what have in future to submit to bitterly repented that advertisement have be seen by timothy still on one point be peculiarly anxious without hardly daring to anatomise feeling be relative to cecilia de clare what mr masterton have mentioned in course of conversation next morning wrote to timothy to mr cophagus giving short detail of what have be informed by mr masterton expressing wish then really did feel that have never be summoned away from having finished letter set off to park street to call upon lady de clare cecilia be rather early footman who opened door recognised be admitted upon own responsibility be now more than eighteen month since have quitted house at richmond be very anxious to know what reception might have followed servant up stair when opened door walked in a name be announced lady de clare rose in haste so did cecilia so did third person whom have not expected to have met harcourt mr newland exclaimed lady de clare be indeed unexpected cecilia also came forward blushing to forehead harcourt held back a if waiting for advance to be made on side on whole never felt more awkwardly believe feeling be reciprocated by whole party be evidently de trop do know mr harcourt at last said lady de clare if be mr harcourt once knew replied certainly do believe be same newland said harcourt turning to offering hand took with pleasure be long while since met observed cecilia who felt necessary to say something at same time did not like to enter upon affair before harcourt be miss de clare replied for be not exactly pleased at reception have be fortunate since have pleasure of seeing last cecilia mother looked earnestly a much a to say in what did not like to ask question there be one present who be not well acquainted with history observed be until time left lady de clare have wish to create mystery have at last discovered father hope be to congratulate mr newland said lady de clare a far a respectability family be concerned certainly have reason to be ashamed replied be brother of earl general in army name will not mention until have seen be formally openly acknowledged have also advantage of being only son if be not disinherited heir to considerable property continued smiling sarcastically perhaps may now be better received than have be a japhet newland foundling lady de clare be afraid have intruded unseasonably will now take leave good morning without waiting for reply made hasty retreat gained door flushed with indignation have nearly gained bottom of stair when heard light footstep behind arm be caught by cecilia de clare turned round looked reproachfully in face a tear stood in eye what have done japhet that must treat in manner said with emotion miss de clare replied have reproach to make perceived that presence be not welcome must no further intrude be then so proud now that have found out that be well born japhet be much too proud to intrude where be not wished for miss de clare a japhet newland came here to see fleta of former day when assume real name will always be most happy of introduction to daughter of lady de clare oh how changed exclaimed fixing large blue eye upon prosperity change miss de clare wish very good morning turned away crossed hall to door a went out must not help looking back perceived that cecilia handkerchief be held to eye a slowly mounted stair walked home to piazza in very pleasant humour be angry disgusted at coolness of reception thought ill used treated with ingratitude so much for world said a sat down in apartment spun hat on table have be out two season be longer same person yet how lovely have grown why change why be harcourt there must have prejudiced against very possibly while idea be running in mind be making comparison between cecilia de clare susannah temple not much in favour of former looking forward prospectively to meeting with father doubt a to reception in society colouring everything with most sombre tint door opened in walked harcourt announced by waiter chair for mr harcourt said to waiter with formality newland said harcourt come for two reason in first place be commissioned by lady to assure beg pardon mr harcourt for interrupting require ambassador from lady in question may make confidant if please be not at inclined to do same explanation after what witnessed felt morning be quite unnecessary surrender claim upon lady de clare daughter if ever be so foolhardy a to imagine have first reason of visit be therefore useless to proceed with may ask other reason have procured honour hardly know mr newland replied harcourt colouring deeply whether after what have now said ought to proceed with second related to myself be attention mr harcourt replied bowing politely be to say mr newland must have taken earliest opportunity after recovery have not disappeared so strangely to have expressed sorrow for conduct towards to have acknowledged have be deservedly punished more perhaps by own feeling of remorse than by dangerous wound have received by hand take even opportunity although not apparently favourable one of expressing what consider duty a gentleman who have wronged to express certainly be going to add more there be so little chance of being well received that have better defer to future opportunity time may come certainly trust will come when may be allowed to prove to that be not deserving of coolness with be now received mr newland with wish for happiness will now take leave must say be with painful sentiment a feel that result of interview will be cause of great distress to who be bound to not only by gratitude sincere regard harcourt then bowed quitted room be very well muttered know world be not to be soothed down by few fine word trust that will be sorry for conduct see again inside door will not sat down trying to feel satisfied with be not felt that have acted harshly to say more ought to have listened to explanation sent by cecilia mother after coming down stair to expostulate be under great obligation to by quick resentment rendered obligation more onerous be unkind of wished that harcourt have not left room a for conduct tried to find fault with must not be gentlemanly feeling fact be be in very bad humour must not at time discover reason be more le than be more jealous of finding harcourt so intimate at lady de clare than be at unpalatable reception have with waiter came in brought note from mr masterton have morning received summons from father who returned appears two day ago be now at adelphi hotel be sorry to say that stepping out of carriage when travelling missed footing snapped tendon achilles be laid up on couch a may suppose amiability be not increased by accident pain attending a have requested to bring forward immediate evidence a to identity presence of mr cophagus be necessary propose that start for reading to morrow at nine o'clock have curiosity to go down there having leisure day two will be relaxation wish to see old acquaintance timothy shop answer by bearer j masterton wrote few line informing mr masterton must be with at appointed hour then sat down to solitary meal how different from when be last at hotel now knew nobody have to regain footing in society must only be accomplished by being acknowledged by father a soon a be done must call upon lord windermear who must quickly effect what desired next morning be ready at nine o'clock set off with post horse with mr masterton in own carriage told what have occurred day before how disgusted be at reception upon word japhet think be wrong replied old gentleman if have not told of affection for miss temple to see whom by by confess to be one of chief motif of going down with must almost suppose that be blinded by jealousy doe not occur to that if mr harcourt be admitted to lady at early hour there be preference shown in quarter now recollect heard something about be elder brother died be come into property heard somebody say that must in probability succeed in gaining handsomest girl in london with large fortune that be said to be match now if such be case broke in upon quiet reunion between two young people about to be united almost without announcement so unexpectedly after lapse of so long time surely can not be surprised at there being degree of confusion restraint more especially after what have passed between harcourt depend upon be cause of have lady de clare daughter be alone reception must have be very different indeed cecilia following down stair prof that be not from coolness towards harcourt calling upon conversation took place be proof that have be mistaken never viewed in light certainly sir observed merely perceived be considered intrusive finding in company one who have treated ill have be antagonist in field naturally supposed that have prejudiced against hope may be wrong have seen so much of world young a be have become very suspicious then discard suspicion a fast a can will only make unhappy not prevent being deceived if be suspicious will have constant fear of deception hanging over poison existence after remark remained silent for time be analysing own feeling felt that have acted in very absurd manner fact be that one of castle building have be be to marry fleta a soon a have found own father be have actuated almost without knowing felt jealous of harcourt that without being in love with miss de clare actually passionately fond of person felt a if must have married without loving must give up susannah temple whom did love rather than that being whom considered a almost of own creation must herself presume to fall in love that must dare to love until have made up mind whether must take after so long absence having given up hope of ever seeing again reader may smile at absurdity still more at selfishness of feeling so did when have reflected upon despised for vanity folly what be thinking of japhet observed mr masterton tired with long abstraction have be making most egregious fool of sir replied with respect to de clares did not say so japhet to tell truth thought something very like now tell be not jealous at finding in company with harcourt exactly so sir will tell susannah temple when see that may form idea of constancy replied mr masterton smiling why what dog in manger must be ca marry still under circumstance can analyse feeling be natural be natural be not always creditable to human nature let talk little about susannah vagary will be dispersed how old be mr masterton plied with so many question relative to susannah that image alone soon filled mind recovered spirit know what will say at being in dress sir observed have not better change on arrival by mean will fight battle know character pretty well thanks to raving about part three chapter nineteen contains much learned argument upon broad brim garment of grey get best of one great wish of life be granted meet father cold reception very indicative of much after heat arrived in good time at reading a soon a alighted at inn ordered dinner then walked down to shop where found timothy very busy tying down labelling be delighted to see mr masterton perceiving have laid aside quaker dress made scruple of indulging in humour making long face thee ing thou ing mr masterton in very absurd manner desired to go to mr cophagus beg that must allow to bring mr masterton to drink tea afterwards to call at inn give answer then returned to dinner whether will ever make quaker of japhet be very doubtful observed mr masterton a walked back a for making one of fellow timothy will defy laugh at everything replied view everything in ridiculous light at event never will make serious in evening adjourned to house of mr cophagus having received message of welcome entered room first susannah came forward to welcome then drew back when perceived alteration in apparel colouring deeply passed took hand of mr cophagus husband then introduced mr masterton hardly knew thee japhet mildly observed mr cophagus did not think that outward garment must disguise from friend replied so appeareth for sister hath not even greeted in welcome greet thee in kindness sincerity japhet newland replied susannah holding out hand yet did not imagine that in so short time thou wouldst have dismissed apparel of persuasion do find seemly miss temple interposed mr masterton be to oblige who be sincere friend that mr newland have laid aside dress quarrel with creed everyone have right to choose for mr newland have perhaps not chosen badly in embracing tenet let continue steadfast in fair young lady there be creed be perfect even in yours find imperfection religion preaches humility therefore do object to wearing garb of pride of pride sayest thou hath not rather put off garb of humility now appeareth in garb of pride not so young madam when dress a world dress wear not garb of pride when put

to poor not humility of publican who say lord be merciful to sinner apparel of pretended humility be garb of pride for reason have insisted that discard when with tenet interfere not with there can be religion in dress must indeed be weak in requires dress for support susannah be astonished at new feature of case so aptly put by old lawyer mr cophagus looked at husband cophagus pinched arm evidently agreeing with when mr masterton have finished speaking susannah waited few second then replied becomes not one so young weak a be to argue with thee who art so much senior can not cavil at opinion if not correct at least be founded on holy writing have be otherwise instructed then let drop argument miss susannah let tell that japhet wished to resume quaker dress must not permit if there be blame be to be laid to be use being angry with old man like have right to be angry with anyone replied susannah be angry with susannah interrupted can not say that be anger japhet newland hardly know what feeling might have be be wrong must request thy forgiveness susannah held out hand now must forgive too miss temple said old masterton susannah laughed against wish conversation then became general mr masterton explained to mr cophagus what required of mr cophagus immediately acceded be arranged that must go to town by mail next day mr masterton talked great deal about father gave

command temper wished to acknowledge be not without such pretension be a much a to say that father be gentleman presume be specimen of filial duty replied general warmly far from sir there be many gentleman who unfortunately can not command temper be more to be pitied than blamed for sir when such happens to be case invariably redeem error amply so by expressing sorrow offering apology be a much a to say that expect to apologise to allow sir to ask did ever know de benyon submit to insult sir trust not then sir whose feeling of pride will not allow to submit to insult ought never to insult others if in warmth of moment have done so that pride must immediately induce to offer apology not only due to party to own character there be disgrace in making apology when be in error there be great disgrace in withholding act of common justice reparation presume be to infer from that expect apology from general de benyon a far a be concerned that be now of little importance part will probably never meet again if think that must make feel more comfortable be willing to receive must suppose by observation that fully expect otherwise will not stay never have thought of staying

useful for be snake killer indeed must if must live altogether upon snake be very great enemy to never letting one escape strike with foot with such force a to kill immediately be there many snake in country inquired william yes very venomous snake replied mr seagrave so that bird be very useful in destroying observe william that almighty in wisdom have so arranged that animal especially of noxious kind will be multiplied to excess kept under by being preyed upon by other indeed wherever in country animal exists in quantity there be generally found animal destroys secretary inhabits country where snake exist in number that may destroy in england bird must be of little value animal be too large too fierce to be destroyed by others papa for instance elephant lion very true larger animal breed so fast therefore number increase so rapidly for instance pair of elephant will not have more than one young one in space of two year more while rabbit be preyed upon food of so many other beast a well a bird must increase enormously if be not destroyed examine through whole of creation will find that there be unerring hand invariably preserve balance exact that there be more mouth than for food be provided although accidental circumstance may for time occasion slight alteration continued walk until came to den of lion be large place in closed with strong high wall of stone with only one window to for visitor to look at a be open above window be wide with strong iron bar running from top to bottom width between bar be such that lion must put paw out with ease be therefore cautioned not to go too near be fine sight to see eight ten of noble looking animal lying down in various attitude quite indifferent apparently to people outside basking in sun slowly moving tufted tail to fro william examined at respectful distance from bar so did tommy who have mouth open with astonishment in there be at first not little fear mixed soon got bolder gentleman who have accompanied who have be long at cape be relating to mr seagrave captain osborn very curious anecdote about lion william be so interested that did not perceive that tommy have slipped back to grated window of den tommy looked at lion then wanted to make move about there be one fine full grown young lion about three year old who be lying down nearest to window tommy took up stone threw at lion appeared not to notice for did not move although fixed eye upon tommy so tommy became more brave threw then approaching time nearer to bar of window of sudden lion gave tremendous roar sprang at tommy bounding against iron bar of cage with such force have not be very strong must have broken a be shook rattled so that piece of mortar fell from stone tommy shrieked fortunately for fell back tumbled head over heel lion paw must have reached captain osborn mr seagrave ran up to tommy picked up roared with fright a soon a must fetch breath while lion stood at bar lashing tail snarling showing enormous fang take away take on board ship cried tommy who be terribly frightened what did do tommy said captain osborn wo throw more stone mr lion wo indeed cried tommy looking terrified towards animal mr seagrave scolded tommy well for foolish conduct by degree became more composed did not recover until have walked distance away from lion den then looked at other animal be to be seen tommy keeping most respectful distance from one of must even go near to cape sheep with broad tail when have seen everything went back to gentleman house to dinner after dinner returned on board chapter four following morning fresh water provision be received on board once more pacific stretched broad canvas to wind there be prospect of rapid voyage a for many day continued passage with fair wind

drop down at distance from stern of vessel a swam lazily along with wing half furled pick up fragment of food have be thrown over side what great bird be that ready inquired william be albatross largest sea bird have wing be very long have seen shot have measured eleven foot from tip of one wing to tip of other when wing have be spread out be first one have seen said william because seldom meet north of cape sir people do say that go to sleep on wing balancing high up in air papa said william turning to mr seagrave who stood by why be that one bird can swim can not recollect when tommy drove hen into large pond flounced about feather became wet must support no longer then be drowned now how doe sea bird contrive to remain so long on water because sea bird william be provided with sort of oil on purpose to anoint outside of feather oil prevents water from penetrating have not observed duck on shore dressing feather with bill be then using oil to make feather waterproof how odd say how odd william be not expression to use when talk of wonderful provision made by almighty hand who neglect not meanest of creature say rather how wonderful be very true sir observed ready still must not be too hard upon master william for have heard many grownup man make use of same expression on third day of calm barometer fell so low a to induce captain osborn to believe that must have severe gale preparation be made to meet must come on be mistaken towards midnight cloud gathered up fast a gathered up in thick pile heaped one over other lightning darted through in direction a cloud rose up so did wind at first only in heavy gust then lulling again to calm ready said captain osborn how do think will have wind why captain osborn to tell truth think will be steady to one point long may at first blow hard from north be idea will shift soon to other quarter blow still harder what think mackintosh will have plenty of long steady gale notion sooner ship dead light better mr seagrave with william happened to be standing by at time of conversation at term dead light willy face expressed anxiety ready perceived said be foolish name give to shutter go over cabin window to prevent water from breaking into cabin when vessel sail before wind know have on last time that have gale ready said captain osborn why do think that will have shift of wind well know perhaps be wrong replied old man mr mackintosh be right wind doe seem to come steady from north east be certain ready walked away to binnacle looked at compass mr seagrave william then went below mr mackintosh went forward to give order a soon a be gone ready went up again to captain osborn said captain osborn be not for to contradict mr mackintosh be of little consequence in time like must have held to opinion have not be that gentleman passenger son be standing by now a coast be clear tell that will have something worse than gale of wind have be in latitude before be old seaman a know there be something in air there have be something during last three day of calm reminds too well of what have seen here before be sure that will have little better than hurricane a far a wind go worse in one point that will last much longer than hurricane generally do have be watching even bird tell so be told by nature be never mistaken that calm have be nothing more than repose of wind previous to being roused up to do worst be real opinion well be inclined to agree with ready so must send topgallant yard down on deck small sail lumber out of top get trysail aft bent lower down gaff will go forward preparation be hardly complete before wind have settled to fierce gale from north east sea rose rapidly topsail after topsail be furled by dusk pacific be flying through water with wind on quarter under reefed foresail storm staysail be with difficulty three men at wheel must keep helm such be blow vessel received from heavy sea on quarter not one seaman in ship took advantage of watch below to go to sleep night careless a generally be storm be too dreadful about three o'clock in morning wind suddenly subsided be for minute two then again burst on vessel from quarter of compass a ready have foretold splitting foresail into fragment lashed flogged wind till be torn away by carried far to leeward heaven above be of pitchy darkness only light be from creaming foam of sea on side shift of wind have be to west north west compelled to alter course of vessel for have chance to scud a now did under bare pole in consequence of sea having taken run from former wind have be north east be a sailor call cross minute wave poured over ship sweeping before weight of water one poor man be washed overboard attempt made to save must have be unavailing captain osborn be standing by weather gunnel holding on by one of belaying pin when said to mackintosh how long will last think longer than ship will replied mate gravely must hope not replied captain still can not look worse what do think ready far more fear from above than from below just now replied ready pointing to yard arm of ship to of be little ball of electric matter attached flaring out to point look at two cloud sir rushing at other if ready have not time to finish what must have said before blaze of light so dazzling that left in utter darkness for second afterwards burst upon vision accompanied with peal of thunder at whole vessel trembled fore aft crash rushing forward shriek be heard when have recovered eyesight foremast have be rent by lightning a if have be lath ship be in flame men at wheel blinded by lightning a well a appalled must not steer ship broached to away went mainmast over side be wreck confusion dismay fortunately heavy sea poured over forecastle soon extinguished flame must have perished ship lay now helpless at mercy of wave beating violently against wreck of mast floated to leeward be still held fast to vessel by rigging a soon a must recover from shock ready first mate hastened to wheel to try to get ship before wind must not do a foremast mainmast being gone mizenmast prevented paying off answering to helm ready having persuaded two of men to take helm made sign to mackintosh for now wind be so loud that must not hear other speak going aft obtained ax cut away mizen rigging mizen topmast head of mizenmast went over side then stump of foremast be sufficient to get ship before wind again still there be much delay confusion before must clear away wreck of mast a soon a must make inquiry found that four of men have be killed by lightning fall of foremast there be now eight remaining besides captain osborn two mate chapter five sailor be never discouraged by danger a long a have chance of relieving by own exertion loss of shipmate so instantaneously summoned away wrecked state of vessel wild surge burying beneath angry water howling of wind dazzling of lightning pealing of thunder did not prevent from doing what necessity demanded first mate rallied men contrived to fix block strap to still smoking stump of foremast rope be rove through block main topgallant sail hoisted so that vessel might run faster before gale answer helm better than did ship be again before wind comparatively safe notwithstanding heavy blow now received from pursuing wave night again came on there be repose men be worn out with exposure fatigue third day of gale dawned appearance be a alarming a ever continual breaking of sea over stern have washed away binnacle be impossible now to be certain of course ship have be steered distance have be run leaky state of vessel proved how much have already suffered from violent shock have received certainty be apparent that if weather did not abate must not possibly withstand force of wave much longer countenance of captain osborn showed great anxiety have heavy responsibility on shoulder might lose valuable ship still more valuable cargo even if did not lose life for be now approaching where sea be studded with low coral island upon might be thrown by wave wind without having slightest power to prevent in present disabled condition ready be standing by when captain osborn said much like ready be now running on danger have help for be true enough replied ready have help for be god will sir will be done amen replied captain osborn solemnly then continued after pause there be many captain who envied when obtained command of fine ship must change with now must rather think not captain osborn never know what day may bring forth sailed with vessel full of hope now not without reason feel something approaching to despair who know may please almighty to rebuke angry wind wave to morrow may again hope for best at event have done duty man can do more be right replied captain osborn hold hard ready that sea aboard of ready have just time to cling with hand to belaying pin when sea poured over vessel with volume of water for time swept off leg clung on firmly at last recovered foot started timber two with blow rather think said ready be afraid so best vessel ever built must not stand such shock long replied captain osborn at present with weak crew see that can get more sail upon night ship flew in darkness before gale at daybreak wind abated sea went down ship be however still kept before wind for have suffered too much to venture to put broadside to sea preparation be now made for getting up jury mast worn out seaman be busily employed under direction of captain osborn two mate when mr seagrave william came upon deck william stared about perceived to astonishment that tall mast with rigging sail have disappeared that whole deck be in state of confusion disorder see child said mr seagrave wreck devastation be here see how pride of man be humbled before element of great jehovah ay master willy said old ready look around a well may do remember verse in bible if not remember well for have often read have often felt truth of that go down to sea in ship do business in great water see work of lord

sort of sail again have lost great mast so must put up jury mast a call be little one little sail upon if plea god will see sydney yet how be madam sir continued ready to mr seagrave be better fear be very weak ill replied mr seagrave nothing fine weather will do good do think that will be fine now why sir to tell truth fear will have more of yet have not given thought to captain a might be mistaken still think so have not be fifty year at sea without learning something like gathering of bank there mr seagrave must wonder if be to blow again from very same quarter that before dark god

harder heart among than of mr mackintosh be useless speaking to one of must not be too severe upon boat be small must not hold more people with provision take with be fact if be to take family into boat might be cause of perishing together if thought otherwise must try what must do to persuade be useless what must be done then ready must put trust in merciful god mr seagrave who will dispose of a think fit must what go with mr seagrave have be thinking about last hour have made up mind to remain with intend to take poor captain osborn with give chance have offered to take will stay here to perish replied mr seagrave with surprise a god plea mr seagrave be old man be of little consequence care little whether be taken away year two sooner like to see blossom cut off in early spring may be

perish countenance be that of man in utter despair at last old ready spoke think that will be saved that must perish mr seagrave forget that there be power above who will decide that point power compared to effort of weak man be a nought true replied mr seagrave in low voice still what chance can have on sinking ship with so many helpless creature around confess can not imagine must do best submit to will replied ready who then went aft shifted helm so a to put ship again before wind a old man have foretold to seaman before quitted vessel gale be now over sea have gone down considerably ship however dragged slowly through water after short time ready lashed wheel went forward on return to quarter deck found mr seagrave have thrown down apparently in state of despair upon sail on captain osborn have be laid after accident mr seagrave give way said ready if thought situation hopeless must candidly say so there always be hope even at very worst there always ought to be trust in god without whose knowledge not sparrow fall to ground mr seagrave will speak a seaman tell what probability be ship be half full of water from seam having opened by straining in gale heavy blow received now that gale have abated have recovered very much have sounded well find have not made many inch within last two hour probably a close seam will make le if therefore plea god that fine weather must continue there be fear of vessel sinking under for time a be now amongst island be not impossible nay be very probable that may be able to run ashore thus save life thought of when refused to go in boat thought also mr seagrave that if be to have be deserted by a well a by rest must have be unable to take advantage of chance might turn up in favour therefore have remained hoping under god providence to be mean of assisting family in sore position think now must be better that must go down into cabin with cheerful face encourage poor mr seagrave with change in weather hope of arriving in place of safety if doe not know that men have quitted ship tell say that steward be with other men will be true enough if possible leave in dark a to what have taken place master william can be trusted if will send here to will talk to hardly know what to think ready how sufficiently to thank for self devotion if may so term in exigency that advice be excellent that will follow may be

walk better said ready a far a can judge must be about way across now ready william recommenced journey after hour walking found that ground be not so level a have be sometimes went gradually up hill at others down be very glad to find island be not so flat here have better chance of finding water be much steeper before replied william be quite hill ground now became more undulating although still covered with cocoa nut tree even thicker together than before continued march occasionally looking at compass until william showed symptom of weariness for wood have become more difficult to get through than at first how many mile do think have walked ready said willy about eight must think not more than eight think that have made more than two mile hour be slow work travelling by compass

small hollow then went up hill again a soon a arrived at top william cried out sea ready there be sea very true william be not sorry for thought never must get out of nasty wood again said william a impatiently pushed on at last stood clear of cocoa nut grove ready soon joined surveyed scene before in silence chapter fifteen oh how beautiful exclaimed william at last be sure mamma must like to live here thought other side of island very pretty be nothing compared to be very beautiful replied ready thoughtfully more lovely scene must scarcely be imagined cocoa nut grove terminated about quarter of mile from beach very abruptly for there be rapid descent for about thirty foot from where stood to land below on be mixture of little grass knoll brushwood to about fifty yard from water edge where be met with dazzling white sand occasionally divided by narrow ridge of rock ran inland water be deep blue except where be broken into white foam on reef extended for mile from beach rock of now then showed above water on rock be perched crowd of gannet men of war bird while others wheeled in air now then darting down into blue sea bringing up in bill fish out of shoal rippled water bounded clear of in gambol form of coast be that of horse shoe bay two point of land covered with shrub extending far out on side line of horizon far out at sea be clear unbroken ready remained for time without speaking scanned horizon right left then turned eye along land at last william said what be thinking of ready why be thinking that must look for water a fast a can why be so anxious because can see island to leeward of a expected therefore there be le chance of getting off island bay although very beautiful be full of reef see inlet make awkward for many reason can not judge at first sight let now sit down take dinner after will explore little ready cut two wide mark in stem of cocoa nut tree then descended with william to low ground where sat down to eat dinner a soon a meal be finished first walked down to water edge ready turned eye inland to see if must discover little ravine hollow might be likely to contain fresh water there be one two place there observed ready pointing to with finger where water have run down in rainy season must examine carefully not now want to find out whether there be mean of getting little boat through reef of rock otherwise will have very hard work if change abode to spot to bring store through wood so will pas rest of day in examining coast to morrow will try for fresh water look at dog ready be drinking sea water poor thing wo

dog snuffed about more eagerly than before see william poor dog be now so eager for water that if there be will find out where never must expect water above ground there may be below beach be hardly far enough from water edge must try in sand for in sand must not be salt replied william no not if at good distance from sea beach for see william sand by degree filter sea water fresh very often when sand run in long way from high water mark if dig down will find good fresh water at other time be little brackish still fit for use look ready at romulus remus how hard be digging with paw there in hollow thanks to heaven that be know how happy have made feel for to tell truth be beginning to be alarmed why do dig because there be water there poor animal now see advantage of having kept in pain

then directed step towards sandy beach having walked time sat down upon coral rock who must have ever imagined william said mr seagrave that island so many more abound in pacific ocean must have be raised by work of little insect not bigger than pin head insect father replied william yes insect give that piece of dead coral william do see that on branch there be hundred little hole well in one of little hole once lived sea insect a insect increase so do branch of coral tree yes understand how do make out that island be made by almost island in sea have be made by labour increase of small animal coral grows at first at bottom of sea where be not disturbed by wind wave by degree a increase advance higher higher to surface till at last come near to top of water then be stopped in growth by force of wind wave break off of course never grows above water for if did animal must die then how doe become island by very slow degree time perhaps much depending upon chance for instance log of wood floating about covered with barnacle may ground upon coral reef must be sufficient commencement for must remain above water then shelter coral to leeward of until flat rock have formed level with edge of water sea bird be always looking for place to rest upon must soon find then droppings must in course of time form little patch above water other floating substance must be thrown on land bird who be blown out to sea might rest on seed from stomach when dropped must grow into tree bush understand well then william observe there be island commenced a be once commenced soon increase for coral must then be protected to leeward grow up fast do observe how coral reef extend at side of island where be protected from wind wave how different be on weather side have just left just so little patch above water protects coral to leeward there island increase fast for bird not only settle on make nest rear young so year soil increase then perhaps one cocoa nut in great outside shell at last be thrown on little patch take root becomes tree year shedding large branch be turned into mould a soon a decay then dropping nut again take root grow in mould thus continue season after season year after year until island becomes a large a thickly covered with tree a one be now standing upon be not wonderful dear boy be not great good god who can make such minute animal a work pleasure at time think fit produce such beautiful island a indeed be exclaimed william only need use eye william will love a well a adore look at shell be not beautifully marked must best painter in world equal

greater did not blame for what have done oh william felt that have done duty towards neighbour perhaps felt in own heart have returned good for evil did not say so next day mr masterman called upon certainly looked very foolish confused when asked for godson whom have so long neglected mother who felt how useful might be to received very kindly have be often told of neglect of mother of supposed unfair conduct towards father have taken violent dislike to advance towards be therefore very coolly received felt glad that have saved although must not exactly understand own feeling at time be ashamed to say that pleasure be not derived from having done good action so much a indulging feeling of revenge in having put one under obligation who have treated ill arose from proud spirit mother

replied mr seagrave require more of sun than will have till rainy season be nearly over few day like will soon be above ground let sit down on knoll be quite dry said mr seagrave little thought continued must have be so happy in desert island thought must feel loss of book very severely really think must have found time to read employment be source of happiness especially when be usefully employed industrious person be always happy person provided be not obliged to work too hard even where have cause for unhappiness nothing make forget so soon a occupation mamma will not always have so much to do a have now said william of course not replied mr seagrave then will find book great source of enjoyment be anxious to go to other side of island see what have be spared to whether have be much damaged that can not be until after rain be over can use boat again look at minute insect be crawling on finger said mr seagrave turning to william what number of leg have yes have seen something like in old book how fast run with little leg thinner than hair how wonderful yes william replied mr seagrave have only to examine into portion however small of creation be immediately filled with wonder there be nothing point out to immensity omniscience of almighty more than careful provision have be made by for smallest most insignificant of created being little animal be perhaps one of many million who have term of existence enjoyment a well a have what be insect of minutest kind nothing in creation yet have same care be bestowed upon formation little leg hardly visible have muscle sinew other portion of body be a complete a fearfully wonderfully fashioned a own such be will what insect ought to feel when compared to god of power of love let also point out to william continued mr seagrave infinity of creative power displayed in endless variety amongst million of men have be born died if ever yet be there seen two face two body exactly alike nay if must examine leaf upon tree although there may be million upon million in forest must not discover two leaf of precisely same form make have often tried in vain replied william yet animal be so much alike can not perceive difference between sheep for instance very true can not tell difference because have not examined shepherd if have seven hundred sheep under care will know one of from others prof that there must be great difference between although not perceptible to casual observer same doubt be case with other class of animal yes william observed ready have often wondered over thing have seen have even in ignorance felt what papa have now told have brought into mind word of job when consider be afraid of ' papa said william after pause in conversation have referred to variety wonderful variety shown in work of deity tell other prominent feature in creation one of most remarkable william be order point out to papa where in what quality be most observable everywhere in everything dear boy whether cast eye up to heaven above penetrate into bowel of earth principle of order be everywhere everything be governed by fixed law can not be disobeyed have order in season in tide in movement of heavenly body in instinct of animal in duration of life assigned to from elephant who life more than century to ephemeral fly whose whole existence be limited to hour inanimate nature be subject to same unvarying law metal rock earth mineral kingdom follow one law in crystallisation never varying from form assigned to atom depositing in allotted place until form be complete have order in production order in decay be simple to by whom planet be thrown out into space be commanded to roll in eternal orbit yes star in heaven be beautiful said william be not placed there in order fixed star appear to to be in order be stud heaven at equal distance from other a view must recollect that be at very different distance from earth spreading over infinity of space have reason to suppose that earth be mere unit in multitude of created world only one single portion of infinite whole a star now appear to be useful to mariner enabling to cross trackless sea to astronomer who calculates time season what do mean papa by saying that world of ours be supposed to be one of multitude of created world little knowledge be bounded to own earth have ascertained very satisfactorily to be one of several planet revolving round own sun say own sun because have reason to suppose that of fixed star myriad now not visible to naked eye be sun bright glorious a own of course throwing light heat upon unseen planet revolving round doe not give idea of vastness power immensity of god one almost loses one self in imagination said mr seagrave yes replied mr seagrave have be surmised by who have felt in heart magnificence of great architect that there must be point of view in space where glorious sun seem to confused in heaven above will appear symmetrically arranged will there be viewed in regular order whirling round in one stupendous perfect system of beauty design where can that be if be not in heaven hope to gain there be silence for few moment when william said say that there be people who be atheist papa how can be so if only look around be sure mere examination of work of god ought to make good christian child replied mr seagrave there be in error few deny existence of deity examination of work may make good devout men not christian there be good men to be found under denomination whether be jew mahomedans pagan be not christian very true papa faith in thing seen if may use term dear child may induce men to acknowledge power goodness of almighty will not make wise to salvation for end be necessary a apostle saith to have faith in thing not seen chapter thirty six well ready said mr seagrave after breakfast be to be next job why sir think have better all set to to collect branch end of cocoa nut tree cut down stack for fuel tommy juno have already made good large pile think by to night will have made stack so arranged that rain will not get into much after a weather will not permit to leave house for time will cut salt pan make fish pond will take week at least then will have little more to do near home think strength of rain be over already perhaps in fortnight may venture to walk through wood examine what have saved from wreck be to explore island be not ready said william long to do yes william must be almost last job for will be away for two three night perhaps must look out for fine weather will however do that before bring store round in boat how be to make salt pan ready must cut out of solid rock yes william have three four of what call cold chisel with one of hammer will get on faster than think for coral rock although hard at surface be soft little below whole of day be employed in piling up cocoa nut branch wood ready made square stack like haystack with gable top over tied long branch so that rain must pour off there said ready a came down ladder will be provision for next year have quite enough left to go on with till rainy season be over will have difficulty in collecting afterwards when weather be dry mr seagrave sighed looked grave ready observed said mr seagrave be not that may want still must prepare for next rainy season in case do want captain osborn if life will send to look for have doubt nay believe that mackintosh will do same still must not forget that may have perished although have be so mercifully preserved must put trust in god sir must ready if be will must not murmur have schooled a much a possible thought will come in spite of endeavour to restrain of course will sir be natural however sir must hope for best fretting be good be sinful feel be ready when see how patient even happy wife be under such privation be angry with woman sir bear adversity better than man woman be love if have husband child with in good health will make herself happy almost anywhere men be different can not bear being shut out of world a be now be ambition make unhappy ready replied mr seagrave let say more about god must dispose of a think fit after supper ready being requested by william continued narrative left off if recollect right william just a hottentot with cattle under care have frightened away baboon who be tormenting well came out of cave sat down under rock so that hottentot must not see have sort of council of war romer be for going back giving up again for said be ridiculous to be wandering about without arm to defend against wild beast that might fall in with something worse than baboon very soon be right must have be wisest thing must have done hastings said that if went back must be laughed at idea of being laughed at made agree that must not bear in mind william never let fear of ridicule induce to do what be wrong if have done wrong prevent from returning to what be duty many thanks for advice ready hope william will not forget said mr seagrave well sir such be reason for not giving up mad scheme having so decided next point of consultation between be how be to procure arm ammunition must not do without a be talking over peeped from behind rock to see where hottentot might

beggar when be in charge of property will take notice of passer by if man stop bark immediately in elephant association of idea be even more remarkable indeed understands what be said to better than other animal reasoning power be most extraordinary promise reward will make wonderful exertion be also extremely alive to sense of shame elephant be employed to transport heavy artillery in india one of finest attempted in vain to force gun through swamp take away lazy beast ' said director bring ' animal be so stung with reproach that used so much exertion to force gun on with head a to fracture skull fell dead when chunee elephant be so long in exeter change be ordered a usual to take up sixpence with trunk happened one day that sixpence rolled against skirting board out of reach chunee stopped reflected little while then drawing air into trunk threw out with force against skirting board rebound of air from skirting board blew sixpence towards be enabled to reach be very clever of replied william yes be proof of thought with knowledge of cause effect there be curious instance of horse by bye consider most noble animal of creation be ridden round by master to deliver newspaper invariably stopped at door where paper be to be left happened that two people living at different house took in weekly newspaper between be agreed that one must have first reading of on one week other on following after short time horse became accustomed to arrangement stopped at one house on one week at other house on following never making mistake be very curious what sagacious animal must have be observed william animal also be a know capable of receiving instruction be proof of reasoning power elephant horse dog pig even bird may be taught great deal then papa still wish to know where line be to be drawn between reason instinct be about to come to very point william when animal follow instinct in providing food bringing up young in precaution against danger follow certain fixed rule from never deviate circumstance may occur against instinct can afford regular provision then be that reasoning power be called into action will explain by stating fact relative to bee one of animal upon instinct be most powerful in action there be certain large moth called death head moth be very fond of honey sometimes contrives to force way through aperture of hive gain entrance bee immediately attack be soon destroyed by sting carcass be so large that can not carry out of hive a invariably do body of smaller insect may have intruded appears that sense of smell be very acute what then do do to avoid stench arising from dead body of large moth why embalm covering entirely with wax by no longer becomes offensive to papa might not instinct have provided for such event observed william if such event must have occurred to bee in wild state certainly might have raised question recollect william bee in wild state live in hollow of tree that hole by enter be never more than sufficiently large to admit one bee at time consequently animal larger than bee must gain entrance if did must of course have be easily removed from hive bee be here in new position in artificial state in hive of straw with large aperture therefore met with exigence be not prepared for acted accordingly yes papa perceive difference will conclude observation with one remark appears to that although almighty have thought proper to vary intellectual reasoning power of animal in same way that have varied specie form yet even in arrangement have not be unmindful of interest welfare of man for will observe that reasoning power be chiefly if not wholly given to animal man subject to service for use elephant horse dog thereby making animal of more value a power given to be at service under control of man chapter fifty five on monday morning william ready went away in boat a before to bring round various article from cove have be arranged that be not to return till saturday evening that dog remus be to bring intelligence of welfare afternoon worked hard during week on saturday have completed task with exception of portion of timber of ship everything have be brought round have not be carried up to storehouse a required more time on saturday morning went for last time to cove ready selected heavy oak timber out of quantity be lying on beach part of put into boat remainder towed astern be heavy load although wind be fair to sail back again to bay boat went slowly through water well william said ready have done good week work must say be high time that be done for boat be in rather crazy condition must contrive to patch up by by when there be time will not want to use very much after ready replied william few trip round to little harbour will be will be required before come back again to old quarter be true william leak very much at event will give coat of pitch a soon a possible for slight built little thing a be have done hard duty pray ready why when speak of ship boat do always call well william know why be certain that sailor always do so believe be because sailor love ship ship be wife be very common saying with then see master william vessel be almost thing of life in appearance believe be reason of course if vessel be little boat must be also well think have explained very well ready suppose on monday will set to at storehouse alter for future residence ca begin too soon william replied ready doubt mr seagrave have finished hedge ditch round yam by time if so expect madam will not like to be left in tent alone with juno child so will move back to house again until have altered storehouse must say must rather mamma remained in tent until be finished because be afraid of visit from savage ready be sir be truth ready if do come will see coming must not be better that must all be together even if be obliged to conceal in consequence of not being prepared suppose savage be to overrun island find mother little brother sister defenceless at time be obliged to retreat from house how dreadful must be counted upon retreating to tent so can all together unless be surprised in night that must take care not to be there be not three hour dark in season of year well william doubt not may be right if be with juno will be great help will get through work faster have better let question be decided by father mother very true william here be point at last will haul timber on beach then be off a fast a can for be getting late be indeed much later than have usually arrived at little harbour owing to heavy load made boat so long in coming round from cove when pulled in found mr mr seagrave child waiting for be very late william said mr seagrave be quite uneasy till saw boat at distance yes mamma must not help have heavy load to bring round now work be done be delighted to hear william for can not bear being away so long work be done said mr seagrave hedge ditch be finished morning well then observed ready must hold council presume will not take very long expect not seldom doe when people be of same mind mr seagrave wo be left here ready want to leave so presume on monday start home again yes sir if please replied ready juno hope have good supper said william for be very hungry yes massa william plenty fried fish massa catch morning chapter fifty six next day being sunday be day of repose a have worked so hard felt luxury of day of rest in afternoon agreed that on monday must make preparation for quitting tent returning to house at bay decided that live stock must all be left there a pasturage be so plentiful good with exception of one goat must take back with to supply with milk also agreed that tent must be left standing with cooking utensil that in case william ready went round for banana yam to examine live stock must not be compelled to sleep in open air must have mean of dressing dinner william ready be to carry bed etcetera round to bay in boat must do in two trip mr mr seagrave with family be to walk through wood after taking very early breakfast point being arranged have finished supper when william again brought up conversation about animal a be delighted to bear mr seagrave talk on subject conversation have not commenced more than few minute when william said papa always say a stupid a as ' be as stupid animal william be very sagacious one character have be given to animal more on account of obstinacy untractableness than on other account be usual to say a stupid a as a stupid a pig goose now three animal be very much maligned for be sagacious animal fact be that a regard as have only very sorry specimen of animal in england be stunted small from want of corn proper food besides being very ill treated be slow dull looking animal climate of england be much too cold for as in south of france mediterranean where be much warmer as be much finer animal to see in perfection must go to torrid zone in guinea right on equator hottest portion of globe where as in native state in native country be handsome creature a fleet a wind indeed supposed to be mentioned in scripture a fleetest animal in creation fact be that in asia especially in palestine syria ass be in great repute used in preference to horse must see animal in own climate to form true estimate of value doe climate then make so great difference said william of course doe not only with animal with tree plant even man until be accustomed to change with respect to animal there be can bear different variety of climate even change of food horse for instance although originally indigenous to arabia life a well in temperate even in frigid zone may be said for endure hard winter of russia north america so will domestic cattle such a cow sheep pig etcetera be curious fact that during winter in canada large proportion of food of cattle consists of fish fish papa cow eat fish yes dear boy such be fact be remarkable instance of graminivorous grass eating animal being changed for time into flesh eating rather into fish eating animal there be other animal can live under temperature a wolf fox hare rabbit be curious provision that sheep goat in hottest climate throw off warm covering of wool retain little better than hair while removed to cold climate recover warm covering immediately goat have wool papa what be cashmere shawl made of william very true papa most animal have certain increase of covering a recede further from warm climate to cold one wolf fox hare rabbit change colour of skin to white when get far north little english stoat be destroyed by gamekeeper becomes beautiful snow white ermine in russia other cold country well papa think great advantage to man proof of almighty care of kindness to in permitting animal most useful to to be able to live in country know whether be wrong in saying so papa can not see why animal like wolf must not have be kept to own climate like lion tiger other ferocious animal have started question william be glad have done rather than must have remained on mind have puzzled be true that shepherd might agree with that wolf be nuisance equally true that husbandman may exclaim what be good of thistle various weed choke soil dear boy if be not think be for benefit of man at event be doom for first transgression cursed be ground for thy sake thorn thistle will bring forth to thee by sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread ' be almighty sentence be only by labour that husbandman can obtain crop by watchfulness that shepherd can guard flock labour be in benefit without exercise there must be health without health there must be enjoyment see now papa have mentioned animal can live in climate will not tell something about other animal there be one remark to make william be that animal indigenous to be originally to be found in one portion of globe invariably be so fashioned a to be most fit for country have food also most proper for growing to be obtained in country take for instance camel animal fashioned expressly for country to be indigenous without whose aid communication must have be stopped between asia africa be called ship of desert for desert be sea of sand ' foot be so fashioned that can traverse sand with facility can live upon coarsest vegetable food salt plant be found there have capacity of carrying water in sort of secondary stomach for own supply where water be to be found here be animal wonderfully made by almighty for express locality for convenience of man in country for in england elsewhere must be of value be late dear william so will first thank for mercy then to bed chapter fifty seven next morning be one of bustle there be packing up preparation for departure juno be called here called there be obliged to ask little caroline to look after kettle call to if boiled over master tommy a usual be in one way doing more harm than good in attempt to assist at last ready to get rid of sent down with large bundle to beach tommy shouldered with great importance

utensil table chair be first article put into boat goat be then led down set off with full load arrived at bay long before party who be walking through wood landed thing on beach then shoved off again to bring round bedding be be left by three o'clock in afternoon have arrived at bay with second last load found that other party have be there about hour mr seagrave juno be very busy taking article up from beach well william said ready be last trip for time expect so much better for little boat must have something done to a soon a can find time yes indeed ready have done work well do know feel a

portion of into pot ready for mr seagrave a soon a breakfast be over proceeded to storehouse after little consultation with mr seagrave ready marked out square of cocoa nut tree surrounding storehouse so a to leave space within of about twenty yard side considered large enough for inclosure cocoa nut tree be to serve a post between be to be fixed other cocoa nut tree cut down about fourteen foot high so a to form palisade stockade must not be climbed over must protect from attack of savage a soon a line of tree have be marked out set to work cutting down tree within line then outside to distance of ten yard so a to give room for work ready cut out cross piece to nail from tree to tree now found advantage of having saved so many of large spike nail without never must have made so good so quick job of mr seagrave cut down tree william juno sawed off at proper length with one of cross cut saw then carried to ready soon have more cut out than must use then dragged away top branch piled at distance on ground to use a winter fuel while mr seagrave helped ready in fixing up palisade worked very hard that day be not sorry to go to bed ready however took opportunity to speak to william think said now be here again will be necessary to keep sort of night watch in case of accident will not go to bed till be quite dark will be by nine o'clock will have glass to examine offing

to see if there be anything to be seen of if there be not of course may go to bed again a can not arrive till many hour afterwards must watch wind weather if be favourable for to come to indeed wind will not be except at commencement of rainy season may be very light then must not care for being against have be thinking of william great deal idea be that will be at beginning of rainy season that will have visit if have one at for see that wind blow regular from one quarter a doe now be variable then can make sail in canoe come here easily instead of pulling between thirty forty mile be hard work against wind current still must not be careless must keep good look out even now want to fret father mr seagrave with fear on subject tell really think what ought to do agree with ready will take

boat boat have drifted from beach be now cable length away from among breaker william ran off like wind followed close by mr seagrave ready at distance by mr seagrave juno indeed there be time to be lost for wind be off shore in short time boat must have be out to sea william a soon a arrived at beach threw off hat jacket dashed into water be already up to middle when old ready who have followed caught by arm said william go back immediately insist upon going can do no good a understand thing so well a do go will so there will be double risk for nothing mr seagrave order back will obey insist upon sir william said mr seagrave come back immediately command william obeyed before be clear of water ready have swam across to first rock on reef be now dashing through pool between rock towards boat oh father said william if good old man be lost will never forgive look father one two three shark here close to have chance see be again in deep water god protect in meantime mr seagrave whose wife be now by side after glancing eye moment at shark be within few foot of beach have kept gaze steadily upon ready movement if passed through passage of deep water between rock might be considered safe a boat be now beating on reef on other side where water be willow be moment of intense anxiety at last ready have gained reef have hand upon rock be climbing on be safe be not whispered mr seagrave faintly yes now think be replied mr seagrave a ready have gained footing on rock where water be little above ankle think there be deep water between boat in minute ready be over rock have seized gunnel of boat be in boat cried william thank god yes must thank god fervently replied mr seagrave look at monster continued pointing to shark how quick swim to fro have scented prey on water be fortunate be here see have boat hook be pushing boat off reef into deep water oh be quite safe now such however be not case boat have be beating on rock of reef have knocked hole in bottom a soon a ready have forced boat into deep water began to fill immediately ready pushed a hard a must with boat hook tearing off neck cloth forced a much a must of into hole saved boat be up to thwart with water least motion on part of ready even tommy must have upset immediately have still to pas deep water between reef beach where shark be swimming ready who perceived danger called out to to throw large stone at shark a fast a must to drive away be immediately done by mr seagrave william aided by juno mr seagrave pelting of stone have desired effect shark swam away ready passed through to beach boat grounded just a be up to gunnel in water about to turn over handed out tommy who be so dreadfully frightened that must not cry a soon a ready landed william sprang into arm cry thank god be safe ready mr seagrave overpowered by feeling sank head upon william shoulder burst into tear be touch go william observed ready a walked up to house preceded by mr mr seagrave how much mischief may be created by thoughtless boy however one ca put old head on young shoulder so tommy must be forgiven have be punished enough a far a fright go replied william will answer for will never get into boat again by think not now william saw how nearly be swamped in boat indeed be only by mercy be preserved taking question merely a far a endeavour must help do think that if have gained boat instead of must have brought to beach a did ready never must have managed so skilfully a did therefore must have be swamped before got on shore well william a be old sailor be not therefore be not vanity make say that must not have managed boat so well a did now a have not three four second to spare a say must have be swamped mention to prove to be right in desiring father to order back certainly ready tommy be brother felt that be more duty than yours to risk life for very proper feeling william have other duty be to look after father mother be comfort solace to life be more valuable than mine be old man on brink of grave year two make difference life be hope of more consequence that evening prayer be more than usually solemn thanksgiving more heartfelt sincere exhausted with exciting scene of day retired early to bed chapter fifty nine when tommy be questioned on following morning a to inducement to get into boat to great surprise replied that wanted to go round to tent again to see if banana be ripe that intended to eat of be back before dinner time that might not be found out suspect tommy must have be very hungry before ate banana if have not perceived said ready wo go into boat more said tommy rather think will keep to resolution tommy replied mr seagrave however must leave mother to point out to danger be in in placed others by folly stockade be now almost finished door be occasion of good deal of consultation at last be agreed that must be better to have door of stout oak plank with second door post inside about foot apart from door between must be inserted short pole

deal planking middle room door opened into be sitting eating room with window behind two side room be sleeping room one for mr seagrave child other for male portion of family see william said ready when be alone what have be able to do by mean of deal plank why to have floored house run up partition must have taken year if have have to saw wood yes what comfort be to have so many shelf about when will shift into house sooner better have plenty of work still to do can work outside of stockade what do propose to do with old house said william have better put of store of least value in for present until can fit up storehouse inside stockade then will put cask in for take up great deal of room that large one william will want that will fix up in corner what for ready to put water in be closer to spring than be at other house know that perhaps may not be able to go out of stockade then will want water understand ready how thoughtful be if at age did not think little william must be very odd know how anxious be to see inside of defence why must not come in ready why sir a there be still plenty of work like to press matter lest mamma must be fidgeted think there be danger danger there be have kind of forewarning of wish must propose that must come in at once standing bed place be ready except canvas will nail on new by to night in consequence of conversation william proposed at dinnertime that next day must go into new house a be so much more handy to work there live there at same time mr seagrave be of same opinion mr seagrave thought better that everything must be tidy first why ma'be said ready only way to get thing tidy be to go make so nothing will ever be in place unless be there to put in well ready said mr seagrave since be against a well a rest give up if please will shift over to morrow indeed ma'be think will be better be last month of fine weather will have plenty to do be so ready be best judge to morrow will take up quarter in stockade thank god

that dark patch saw there be brown grass sail sail of what ready said william hastily of indian canoe knew that must come take glass look eye be quite dim from straining so long yes have now replied william with eye to glass at last said why there be twenty thirty of ready at least with twenty thirty men in too william what must do ready how frightened poor mother will be be afraid can hing against number yes william can do great deal must do great deal that there be hundred of savage there be doubt recollect that have stockade can not easily climb over plenty of firearm ammunition so that can make good fight of perhaps beat off for have nothing club spear how fast come down ready why will be here in hour sir in two hour be very large canoe however there be time to be lost while watch for few minute till make more clearly out do run up to house beckon father to come down to then william get musket ready bring cask of powder of made up cartridge from old house into stockade call juno will help will have time enough to do everything after have done that have better come down join in very few minute after william ran up to house mr seagrave made appearance ready there be danger be sure william must not tell presume because be afraid of alarming mother what be be mr seagrave that savage be now coming down upon in large force perhaps five six hundred of that will have to defend with might main do think have chance against force yes sir with god help have doubt that will beat off must fight hard for day fear mr seagrave examined fleet of canoe with glass be indeed dreadful odds to contend against sir three musket behind stockade be almost match for club spear provided none of be wounded well ready must put trust in lord do best will second to utmost of power william be sure will do duty think sir said ready have better not wait here more a have not long to prepare for have only to fix up of strong deal plank on inside of stockade for to stand upon when be attacked that may see what enemy be about be able to fire upon first have better go to old house take out what provision other article will most want roll cask into stockade for to old house will go first perhaps destroy everything in cask certainly will for sake of iron hoop hour work will do great deal believe have everything want in stockade juno have fuel large butt of water will last two three week at least if have time will get wheel down spear couple of turtle for fresh provision observation be made a walked up to house a soon a arrived found william juno have just brought in powder cartridge mr seagrave went in to break matter to wife be told that have to expect dear replied mr seagrave so that have not come upon altogether unawares anything that poor weak woman can do will be indeed greatly relieved said mr seagrave by finding thus prepared supported will feel anxiety have work to be done mr mr seagrave then joined william ready juno who have already proceeded to old house child be still in bed asleep so that there be occasion for one to watch chapter sixty one a must have very good view of canoe from where old house stood ready examined with glass time that returned from rolling up cask to stockade one worked hard even mr seagrave did must either assisting in rolling cask carrying up what be able to lift in hour have got into stockade that most cared for canoe be still about six seven mile off have good hour before arrive sir said ready even then reef will puzzle not little doubt if be disembarked under two hour have plenty of time for wish to do juno go for wheel william come down with spear will have of turtle into stockade mr seagrave require assistance so if will have kindness to get out musket examine flint will be a well yes then have to load replied mr seagrave juno can do at event ready for to fire excellent idea madam replied ready in hour six turtle be brought up by juno william then ready followed into stockade then rolled cask upheaded by side of stockade fixed up deal plank to stand upon just high enough to enable to see over top of palisade to fire at enemy mr seagrave have be shown how to load musket juno be now taught same now sir be prepared said ready madam juno can go look little after child get breakfast a soon a child be dressed mr seagrave called ready who be outside watching canoe went to morning devotion prayed heartily for succour in time of need then breakfasted in haste for a may be supposed be almost too anxious to eat suspense be worse than said mr seagrave wish now that be come will go to ready hear report dear will not be away three minute in short time mr seagrave returned saying that canoe be close to beach that savage evidently have knowledge of passage through reef a have steered right in have lowered sail that ready be on look out concealed behind cocoa nut tree hope will not stay out too long fear of dear selina have better watch motion to last minute during conversation between mr mr seagrave within stockade william ready be watching motion of savage large portion of whom have landed out of ten of canoe others be following example a fast a must forcing way through reef savage be painted with war cloak feather on armed with spear club evidently having come with peaceable intention william who have taken telescope to examine more minutely said to ready what fierce cruel set of wretch appear to be if overpower will certainly kill of there be doubt william must fight hard not let overpower kill certainly will be not sure that may not eat afterwards be of little consequence william replied in determined tone will fight a long a have breath in body ready be coming up a fast a can yes must wait no longer come william thought saw vessel under sail out away by garden point ready just a turned away very likely sir canoe have separated from others during night come quick william have begun to yell half minute arrived at door of stockade entered shut door then barricaded with cocoa nut pole have fitted to inner door post chapter sixty two loud yell of savage struck terror into heart of mr seagrave be well that have not seen painted body fierce appearance must have be much more alarmed little albert caroline clung around neck with terror in face did not cry looked round round to see from whence horrid noise proceeded then clung faster to mother tommy be very busy finishing breakfast have be left for there be one to check a usual juno be busy outside be very active courageous mr seagrave have be employed making hole between palisade large enough to admit barrel of musket so that must fire at savage without being exposed while william ready with musket loaded be on look out for approach be busy with old house just now sir observed ready wo detain long here come replied william look ready be not that one of woman who escaped from in canoe who be walking along with first two men yes be be sure be right william be one of ah have stopped did not expect stockade be clear have puzzled see how be crowding together talking be holding council of war how to proceed that tall man must be one of chief now william although intend to fight a hard a can yet always feel dislike to begin first will therefore show over palisade if attack will then fire with quiet conscience take care hit ready great fear of william here come ready now stood upon plank within so a to show to savage who gave tremendous yell a advanced dozen spear be thrown at with so true aim have not instantly dodged behind stockade must have be killed three four spear remained quivering in palisade just below top others went over fell down inside of stockade at further end now william take good aim before william must fire mr seagrave who have agreed to be stationed at corner so that might see if savage went round to other side fired musket tall chief fell to ground ready william also fired two more of savage be seen to drop yell of companion juno handed up other musket be ready loaded took discharged mr seagrave having desired caroline to take care of little brother tommy to be very quiet good came out turned key of door upon hastened to assist juno in reloading musket spear now rushed through air be well that must fire from stockade without exposing person must have have little chance yell increased savage now began to attack on quarter most active who climbed like cat actually succeeded in gaining top of palisade a soon a head appeared above be fired at with so true aim that dropped down dead outside combat lasted for more than hour when savage having lost great many men drew off from assault party within stockade have time to breathe have not gained much in bout at event said ready be well fought on side william certainly behaved a if have be brought up to do think will go away now said mr seagrave oh madam not yet will try way before leave see be very brave men be clear that know what gunpowder be must have be more astonished must think so too replied mr seagrave first time savage hear report of firearm be usually thrown into great consternation yes sir such have not be case with people therefore reckon be not first time that have fought with european be gone ready said william who have come down from plank to mother see between tree now be sitting round in circle suppose making speech well be very thirsty at event said william juno bring little water juno went to water tub to comply with william request in few moment afterwards came back in great consternation oh massa oh missy water water gone water gone cried ready of in breath yes not one little drop in cask filled up to top exclaimed ready very gravely tub did not leak that be sure of how can have happened missy tink know now said juno remember send massa tommy two three day wash to fetch water from well in little bucket know how soon come back how say what good boy be how tell massa seagrave when come to dinner now missy quite certain massa tommy take trouble go to well fetch water from tub while so empty be afraid be right juno replied mr seagrave what will do go speak massa tommy said juno running to house be very awkward thing mr seagrave observed ready gravely mr seagrave shook head fact be that perceived danger of position if savage did not leave island must perish of thirst have to surrender in latter case life must most certainly be sacrificed juno now returned suspicion be too true tommy pleased with praise of being so quick in bringing water have taken out spigot of cask drawn off well observed mr seagrave be will

do that will not have so large space to watch over defend then must contrive to have large fire ready for lighting that may not have to fight altogether in dark will give advantage in looking through palisade seeing where be can not well drive spear through so be great matter must make fire in centre of stockade have plenty of tar in to make burn bright must not of course light until after be attacked will then see where be trying for entrance where to aim with musket idea be very good ready said mr seagrave if have not be for unfortunate want of water really must be sanguine of beating

william mr seagrave a be on top of stockade when fire burnt brightly savage outside be more easily aimed at great many fell in attempt to get over attack continued more than hour when at last

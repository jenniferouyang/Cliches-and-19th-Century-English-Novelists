remaining daughter be about to sail in obedience to wish in grosvenor east indiaman under care of colonel mr james who be near connection be heavy blow with pleased god to visit in prosperity be almost total wreck of hope anticipation be good man religious one bowed in humility to dispensation submitting with resignation to loss still thankful to heaven that have graciously spared one of object of affection to console to watch declining year sir charles wilmot took possession of family mansion estate in berkshire in be still residing at time history commences by degree became more resigned waited with anxiety for return of only daughter who now seemed more dear to than ever employed in making preparation for reception fitting up apartment in oriental style have be accustomed to devising little improvement invention thought must give pleasure to child of ten year old pleased heaven that sir charles must be more severely chastised grosvenor time of arrival have elapsed still be not reported in channel week after week of anxiety suspense passed slowly away east india ship did not make appearance be supposed that have be captured by enemy still tidings of capture be received at length however state of anxiety doubt be put end to by dreadful intelligence that ship have be wrecked on east coast of africa that nearly whole of crew passenger have perished two men belonging to have be brought home by danish east indiaman shortly after first intelligence men arrived in london gave more particular detail of what have occurred sir charles in state of feverish anxiety a soon a heard of arrival hastened up to town to question men result of interrogatory fully convinced that be now quite bereaved childless be last blow most severe be long before must resign to unsearchable dispensation of providence time religion have at last overcome repining feeling disposition to question goodness wisdom of heavenly father be enabled to say with sincerity not will thine be done although sir charles be thus left childless a year passed away at last found that have near to for whom felt interest one in particular who promised to deserve regard be grand nephew alexander wilmot who be legal heir to title entailed property son of deceased nephew who have fallen during peninsular war on boy sir charles have lavished affection pleased heaven that must not bestow upon own issue alexander wilmot have gradually become a dear to a if have be own child still loss of wife child be ever in memory a time passed on painful feeling of hope doubt be occasionally raised in sir charles mind from occasional assertion of traveler that did not perish who be supposed so to do when grosvenor be wrecked that from report of native of of descendant be still alive be paragraph in newspaper containing renewal of assertion have attracted attention of sir charles have put in state of agitation uneasiness in have described at opening of chapter left in deep painful thought with newspaper in hand revery be interrupted by entrance of alexander wilmot who resided with being now twenty two year of age having just finished college education alexander wilmot be tall handsome young man very powerful in frame very partial to athletic exercise be best rower best cricketer at oxford very fond of horse hunting excellent shot in character disposition be generous amiable frank in manner obliging to inferior one liked alexander wilmot certainly deserved to be liked for never injured spoke ill of body perhaps most prominent fault be obstinacy be more shown in obstinate courage perseverance to conquer what appeared almost impossible at greatest risk to be of disposition that must hardly get out of way of mad bull if crossed path risk life probably to purpose there be perfection in world be still le to be expected in young man of only twenty two year of age well uncle have conquered said alexander a came into room very much heated with exercise conquered whom boy replied sir charles colt have backed be now a gentle a lamb fought hard for two hour at least why must run such risk alexander when horsebreaker must have broke just a well not so soon uncle did not know that be in such want of horse a to require such hurry thought have plenty in stable so have uncle thanks to more than can use like pleasure excitement there state truth dear alexander when have lived a long a have will find more pleasure in quiet repose replied sir charles with heavy sigh something have disturbed dear uncle said alexander going up to sir charles taking hand what be sir be right alexander something have unsettled have called up painful feeling reminiscence be that paragraph in newspaper alexander be now a subdued almost a uncle took chair quietly read paragraph do think there be foundation for dear sir said after have read illustration newspaper paragraph be impossible to say dear boy may be so have often be asserted before french traveler le vaillant state that received same information be prevented from ascertaining truth other traveler have subsequently given similar account may easily credit painful anxiety be raised in mind when read statement a think see poor elizabeth wife slave to wild savage child merciful heaven grandchild growing up a brute of field in ignorance idolatry be torture dear alexander absolute torture requires long prayer meditation to restore mind to usual tone to enable to bow to dispensation of divine will although have long be acquainted with general statement dear uncle respecting loss of ship have never yet heard such detail a must warrant apprehension of yours be generally supposed that perished perished indeed most miserably except few men who made way to cape returned to england such be supposition dear boy subsequent report have to certain degree contradicted there be reason to believe that did not perish who be accounted a dead if have nothing particularly to engage at moment will enter into detail of what did occur of proof that fate of large portion among that of aunt elizabeth be never ascertained if will not be too painful to dear uncle will most gladly hear will not dwell longer upon than be necessary alexander believe subject be distressing wish to know also then to give opinion be of course aware that be on coast of caffraria to southward of port natal that grosvenor be wrecked soon divided went to piece by sudden know not that can say fortunate change of wind yet such be will of heaven whole of crew passenger with exception of sixteen who have previously attempted to gain shore by hawser one man who be left on board in state of intoxication be safely landed even to little child who be coming home in vessel among whom be poor elizabeth alexander made observation when sir charles paused for while latter then continued by time that have gained shore day be far spent native who be of caffre race who have be busy in obtaining iron that must from mainmast have drifted on shore left beach at dark wretched sufferer lighted fire having collected cask of beef flour live stock remained on rock during night next morning captain proposed that must make way to cape town dutch settlement to unanimously consented certainly most wild proposition showing very little judgment must have done otherwise dear uncle most certainly knew that be in country of lawless savage who have already come down taken by force thing that must lay hand upon captain calculated that must reach cape town in sixteen seventeen day how far calculation be correct be proved by fact that who did reach at last be one hundred seventeen day on journey even admitting that distance must have be performed in time stated by captain very idea of attempting to force way through country inhabited by savage people with number of helpless woman child without arm for defense be indeed act of folly madness a eventually proved what then must have be plan observe ship be wrecked not cable length from shore firmly fixed upon reef of rock upon have be thrown water be smooth there be difficulty in communication savage content with plundering be washed on shore have to time of quitting rock left uninjured might have gone on board again have procured arm to defend mean of fortifying position against attempt of savage who have other weapon assaguays spear then might have obtained provision other article necessary for support armed a might have be numerous a be for there be one hundred fifty soul on board at time of wreck might have protected until have built boat small vessel out of timber of wreck for carpenter blacksmith be safely landed on shore with by taking course might have coasted along shore have arrived without difficulty at cape most certainly sir must have be most judicious plan captain must have be very deficient in judgment to have acted a did have thing to hand mean men to build boat provision arm sail cordage yet threw chance away attempted to do what be impossible be not one of who be saved believe sir be one of who have not be heard of to proceed first day of march from site of wreck ought to have be warning to to turn back savage robbed of thing threw stone at dutchman of name of trout who have fled to caffre country for murder have committed in colony fell in with told attempt be impracticable from number of savage nation width of river desert country without water number of wild beast must encounter still be not persuaded went on to destruction be not five mile from wreck at time might have returned to before night may not fairly be supposed that after dreadful shipwreck thing be considered preferable by major portion of especially passenger to re embarking may be so still be feeling be to be surmounted must have be have be counseled by judicious leader for might fairly have pointed out to without re embarkation how be to arrive in england very true uncle pray continue from account given by seaman who returned before have traveled week be attacked by large party of native to whose blow ill treatment a passed along have hitherto submitted a in instance native appeared determined to massacre resisted a well a must being nearly one hundred men in force succeeded in driving off not without receiving many severe wound after few day more traveling provision be expended seaman began to murmur resolved to take care of not to be encumbered with woman child consequence be that forty three of number separated from rest leaving captain male female passenger child dear elizabeth among to get on a must how cruel yes self preservation be first law of nature fear be in vain to expect person not under influence of religious principle will risk life submit to much self denial for sake of alleviating misery of others reason given for separation be that be impossible to procure food for so large number that must be more likely to obtain sustenance when divided party who thus proceeded in advance encountered most terrible difficulty coasted along seashore because have other food than shell fish found on rock have continually to cross river from mile to two mile wide be kept from slumber by wild beast prowled around at length endured so much from want of water that suffering be extreme again subdivided separated wandering hardly knew where exposed to burning sun without clothing without food one by one sat down be left behind to die to be devoured by wild beast before be dead at last be reduced to such extremity that proposed to cast lot for one to be killed to support others turned back on route that might find dead body of companion for food finally out of whole crew three four purblind staggering from exhaustion craving for death arrived at border of colony where be kindly received gradually recovered now speak of first party who separated from captain passenger do not uncle yes what became of captain party tidings be heard of fate be unknown be long supposed that have perished for if suffering of seaman inured to toil danger have be so great what chance be there for helpless woman child after year there be report that have be saved be living with savage le vaillant first mentioned then died away be not credited since that report of various traveler appear to give confirmation to what le vaillant asserted paragraph have now read in newspaper have again renewed assertion party from whom proceeds be by account worthy of credence may imagine dear boy what pang give when read report when reflect that poor girl who be with party may at moment be alive may have returned to state of barbarism seed of faith long dead in bosom now changed to wild untutored savage knowing god dear uncle allowing that aunt be alive be not so young at time of wreck a to forget entirely what have be taught be possible then condition must be still more painful rather must say must have be for probably be dead long before if not dead must be woman advanced in life indeed a may observe in account given by traveler in paragraph have read speaks only of descendant of who be lost in grosvenor idea of grandchild having returned to state of barbarism be painful enough wish be possible must discover truth for be uncertainty so much distress have few year to live alexander be very old man a know may be summoned to morrow to night for know not what day may bring forth if be only certain that child have died miserable a death must have be must be happiness to idea that be one of whose descendant speak of if knew how for last thirty year have preyed upon mind must comprehend anxiety on account god will be done let detain longer alexander must prefer being alone alexander at intimation took proffered hand of grand uncle in reverential feeling manner without saying more quitted room chapter ii conversation have have with grand uncle made very forcible impression upon alexander wilmot occasioned to pas very sleepless night remained till nearly four o'clock turning over in mind loss of grosvenor indiaman have occurred long before be born be acquainted with outline of what have taken place have be told when child that relation of family have perished although narrative have at time made impression upon young mind have seldom if ever heard spoken of since may have be said to have almost forgotten be therefore not little surprised when found how great influence have upon grand uncle who have never mentioned to before indeed have escaped alexander memory that be grand uncle only surviving daughter who have be lost in vessel alexander wilmot be warmly attached to old gentleman indeed must have be very ungrateful if have not be for be impossible that one must have be treated with more kindness liberality than be by sir charles be week before that have expressed wish to travel on continent sir charles have immediately given consent that must remain abroad if pleased for two year when approved however of alexander plan have made remark a to own age infirmity probable chance that might not meet again in world remark of grand uncle left impression upon alexander that almost repented having made request have be ever since in state of indecision a to whether must avail of grand uncle kindness disregard of self shown toward in thus having granted permission conversation with sir charles have brought up new idea in mind have witnessed anxiety longing good old relation have shown about fate of daughter have heard from own lip how long ignorance of fate have preyed upon mind to be satisfied on point be one thing wanting to enable old man to die happy to permit to say with sincerity lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace why then must not go to discover truth must not perhaps occupy so long a two year of traveling on continent have be consented to by grand uncle instead of traveling for own pleasure might be mean of satisfying mind quieting anxiety of one who have be so kind to indeed must actually prefer journey into interior of africa to mere sojourn of time on continent very peril danger anticipation of distress hardship be pleasing to high courageous mind before fell asleep alexander have made up mind that must propose expedition if must obtain uncle permission must proceed upon forthwith having come to resolution fell fast asleep dreamed away till eight o'clock in morning that be hunting elephant having hand to hand conflict with variety of beast with have peopled africa in fancy when be called up in morning found determination of night before rather strengthened than otherwise accordingly after breakfast be over opened subject dear sir said to sir charles be kind enough to give permission to travel on continent for two year did do so alexander be natural at age that must wish to see world have full permission when do think of starting depends upon circumstance sir must be altogether guided by to tell truth think that one see much of world by following in beaten track made by so many of countryman there agree with in present high state of civilization there will be found little difference in manner custom of people in court none very little in best society in will of course mix not so very much a people may imagine among mass of population scenery of country remains of ancient time be still interesting will afford pleasure must be own reflection comment upon what see must make profitable most people however travel from love of change added to love of excitement grant sir mean to say must receive much pleasure from continental tour perhaps may add must derive more profit if be to delay till be little older little wiser do not think so certainly do alexander what then do propose remaining in england for present if so be sure be on account be very grateful to for sacrifice if wish sir will undoubtedly remain in england at event if go elsewhere have abandoned continental tour for present have proposal to make hope will meet with approbation why dear alexander on what expedition must now proceed do wish to visit united state south america sir wish to make voyage of still more interest wish to go to africa be to embark for cape of good hope from thence proceed to northward to ascertain if possible what now be source of sad disquiet to actual fate of who be wrecked in grosvenor have not since be heard of with degree of certainty sir charles be for time silent pressed hand to forehead at last removed said can not much a wish can not consent dear boy danger will be too great must not risk life be very kind of very kind must not be indeed sir think on reflection will alter mind a for danger what danger can there be when missionary be permitted to form station reside uninjured among very savage who be so hostile when grosvenor be lost country be then desert be now inhabited by european within mile of very spot where grosvenor be wrecked continual emigration since cape have fallen under british government zeal of who have braved danger to make known word of god to heathen idolater have in forty year made alteration see more danger in mission propose than do in visit to naples a for time have reason to expect that will be back sooner than in two year have proposed for stay on continent if accident be to happen to must never forgive for having given consent few day be left to must be rendered miserable dear sir be in hand of god short sighted a be in running away from danger a often run into what call accident fall of brick stone upsetting of vehicle thing trivial seemingly improbable may summon away when least expect 'in midst of life be in death that death may meet by staying in country might have avoided by going on expedition difficulty may arise danger there may be admit when prepared to encounter be more safe than when in fancied security be taken unawares entreat sir refuse favor have considered well will be most unhappy if be not permitted to obtain information for have so much at heart let travel be of advantage to a well a to myself refuse entreat be good boy alexander kindness make still more unwilling to part with hardly know what to say let drop subject for present will talk of to morrow next day must have time for reflection alexander wilmot did not fail to renew entreaty on following day must not gain sir charles consent be not however discouraged have taken from library work must find relative to southern africa continually enforcing argument by quotation from various author tending to prove that might travel through country without much risk if took proper precaution grand uncle objection grew daily more feeble at last sir charles gave unwilling consent in meantime book alexander have read have produced great effect upon when first proposed mission be more from feeling of gratitude toward old relative than other now be most anxious to go on own account narrative of combat with wild beast quantity variety of game to be found continual excitement must be kept up inflamed imagination love of field sport earnestly requested to be permitted to depart immediately pointing out to sir charles that sooner went away sooner must be back again last argument be not without weight alexander be allowed to make preparation for journey inquiry be made passage secured on board of free trader be to touch at cape in six week from time that subject have be brought up alexander wilmot took leave of grand uncle may god bless sir keep well till return said alexander pressing hand may lord protect dear boy allow to return close eye replied sir charles with much emotion before night alexander wilmot be in london from thence hastened down to portsmouth to embark next day surprise weighed anchor ran through needle before night closed in be well down channel standing before wind with studding sail below aloft chapter iii melancholy feeling clouded feature of alexander wilmot a on following morning vessel under heavy press of sail be fast leaving shore of native country remained on poop of vessel with eye fixed upon land moment became more indistinct thought may easily be imagined will ever see that land again will ever return will bone remain in africa perhaps not even buried bleaching in desert if do return will find old relation still alive called away loaded a be with year to silent tomb be in hand of gracious god will be done alexander turned away a land have at last become no longer visible found young man of about own age standing close to apparently a much lost in reverie a have be a in turning round alexander brushed against thought right to apologize for unintentional act occasioned conversation believe sir said other party who be tall spare slight built man with dark complexion that be indulging in similar thought a took leave of native shore englishman doe same indeed true lover of country let country be what will find feeling a strong in savage a in enlightened be universal indeed may fairly say that extends lower down to brute specie from love of locality very true sir replied alexander with brute a say be merely love of locality with men trust feeling be more generous noble so ought to be else why be so much more nobly endowed be not first voyage presume continued stranger indeed be said alexander never be out of england on board of vessel before yesterday must have imagined otherwise remarked companion other passenger be suffering from sea sickness while only be on deck presumed therefore that have be afloat before did feel very giddy yesterday evening observed alexander morning have unpleasant sensation believe that people suffer at sea very few appears that be one of most fortunate for by experience know how painful distressing sickness be for time breakfast will soon be ready do think that can eat yes little not much cup of tea coffee replied alexander can not say have usual appetite what bird be that skim along water be procellarius a naturalist call in english stormy petrel presence denotes rough weather coming on then wish have not made appearance said alexander laughing for with rough weather there will of course be more motion in vessel feel motion too much already think if eat breakfast although without appetite keep on deck may get over further indisposition replied stranger have many passenger on board nine ten be considered small number at least by captain who be complaining of ill luck be mostly female child there be cape gentleman who have long resided in colony be now returning there have have conversation with appears very intelligent person here be steward coming aft to let know breakfast be ready person who have thus conversed with alexander wilmot be mr swinton who a have accidentally observed be naturalist be person of independent property whose ardor for science have induced to engage in profession being perfectly satisfied with income be sufficient for want to enable to follow up favorite study be now on passage to cape of good hope with other object than to examine natural production of country to prosecute research in science there to greater extent than have hitherto be practicable before have arrived at madeira at island ship remained three day to take in wine fresh provision great intimacy have be established between alexander mr swinton although a yet knew cause of other voyage to cape be too delicate to make inquiry waited till other must of own accord impart reason have mentioned that there be other passenger one of whom be gentleman who resided in cape town who held lucrative situation under government be elderly gentleman of about sixty year of age of very benign prepossessing appearance so happened that alexander found out on looking over letter of introduction when at anchor at madeira that possessed one to gentleman of course presented at once although be already on intimate term introduction made mr fairburn for such be name take immediate interest in welfare also warranted putting question a to what be alexander view intention in visiting cape for mr fairburn knew from letter that be heir to sir charles wilmot therefore that be not likely to be going out a speculator emigrant hardly need be said that alexander made hesitation in confiding to one who must so materially assist in object of voyage other passenger be three young lady bound to friend in india lady returning with two marriageable daughter to rejoin husband who be colonel in bengal army be pleasant people young lady very lively on whole cabin of surprise contained very agreeable party soon after left madeira have fine weather smooth water thing must make voyage endurable awning be spread chair brought up major portion of day be spent upon quarter deck poop of vessel for many day have be running down before trade wind intending to make rio there lay in supply of fresh provision for remainder of voyage one morning a alexander mr fairburn be sitting together alexander observed have passed many year at cape mr fairburn have not yes be taken prisoner when returning from india remained year in cape town during time that be in hand of dutch be about to be sent home a prisoner to holland be embarked on board one of vessel in saldanha bay when be attacked by english afterward when english captured cape from long residence in knowledge of country be offered situation accepted colony be restored to dutch came home on second capture be again appointed have be there almost ever since then be well acquainted with history of colony be certainly if wish will be happy to give short account of will give greatest pleasure for must acknowledge that know little have gleaned from travel have run through very hastily think be in year that dutch decided upon making settlement at cape aborigine native who inhabited that part of country about cape town be hottentot mild inoffensive people living wholly upon produce of cattle be not agriculturist possessed large herd of cattle sheep goat ranged extensive pasture of country history of founding of one colony be fear history of most if not commencing in doing be possible to obtain goodwill of people until firm footing have be obtained in land then treating with barbarity injustice hottentot won over by kindness present thought of little consequence that stranger must posse small portion of extensive territory willingly consented that settlement must be made for first time in life tasted what proved cause of ruin subsequent slavery tobacco strong liquor two poison offered gratuitously till poor hottentot have acquired passion for then became object of barter pipe of tobacco glass of brandy be price of ox thus daily be colonist becoming enriched hottentot poor colony rapidly increased until be so strong that governor made ceremony of seizing upon such land a government wished to retain to give away hottentot soon discovered that not only cattle mean of feeding be taken from eventually be stripped of thing except passion for tobacco spirit must not get rid of unwilling to leave land of forefather seeing other way of procuring mean of intoxication coveted sold service to white colonist content to take care of herd have once be own to lead out to pasture on very land have once be birthright did then become slave inquired alexander although much worse treated never be slave wish to point out became sort of feudal property of dutch compelled to hire out to work for upon nominal wage seldom never received liable to specie of harsh treatment cruelty for must obtain redress yet still be not bought sold a be slave be subsequently introduced into colony from east coast of africa madagascar position of slave be in opinion infinitely superior merely from self interest of owner who must not kill risk life of creature for whom have paid two three hundred rix dollar whereas dutch boor planter thought little of life of hottentot if cattle be to be watched where lion be plentiful be not slave who have charge of hottentot a have cost nothing planter must procure in short life of hottentot be considered a of value there be denying that be shot by master employer upon most trifling offense how dreadful did dutch government suffer must not well help therefore be compelled to wink at criminal be beyond reach now will proceed to give further insight by describing dutch boor planter who usurped stood in shoe of poor hottentot dutch government seized upon land belonging to hottentot gave away in grant to own countryman who now became herdsman possessed of large quantity of cattle also cultivated ground to certain extent round about habitation a colony increased so did demand for land until whole of country be worth having be disposed of a far a to country of caffre fine warlike race of whom will speak hereafter must not however be supposed that whole of hottentot tribe became serf to soil few drove away cattle to northward out of reach of dutch to border of caffre land others deprived of property left plain took to mountain living by chase by plunder portion be termed boshmen bushman have still retained that appellation living in extreme destitution sleeping in cave constantly in state of starvation soon dwindled down to very diminutive race have continued so ever since dutch boor planter who lived in interior far away from cape town have many enemy to contend with have various beast of forest from lion to jackal devastated flock herd also bushman who lived upon plunder continually in danger be never without musket in hand descendant became athletic powerful bulky race courageous skilled in use of fire arm at same time cruel avaricious to highest degree absolute power possessed over slave hottentot demoralized made tyrannical blood thirsty at too great distance from seat of government for power to reach defied knew law own imperious will acknowledging authority guilty of crime openly careless of detection certainly have read of great cruelty on part of dutch boor have idea of extent to be carried origin be in greatest of curse slavery nothing demoralizes so much boor have be brought up with idea that hottentot bushman caffre be a mere brute of field have treated a such must be startled at idea of murdering white man will execute wholesale slaughter among poor native think have committed crime lady be coming up will be interrupted so will not task patience more to day will therefore conclude what may term part first of little history of cape colony chapter iv alexander wilmot be too much pleased with mr swinton not to cultivate acquaintance soon became very intimate conversation often turned upon mr swinton favorite study that of natural history confess wholly ignorant of subject observed alexander one day though feel that must be interesting to who study indeed when have walked through museum have often wished that have one near who must explain to what wished to know be puzzled about appears to that study of natural history be such immense undertaking if comprehend branch let see there be botany mineralogy geology be included be not most certainly replied mr swinton laughing perhaps three most interesting branch then have zoology study of animal ornithology for bird entomology for insect conchology for shell ichthyology for fish very hard name enough to frighten young beginner can assure knowledge of subject to extent sufficient to create interest afford continual amusement be very easily acquired 'the proper study of mankind be man ' say poet observed alexander smiling poet deal in fiction mr wilmot replied mr swinton to study man be only to study inconsistency aberration from right path free will permitted to induces to follow in study of nature witness directing power of almighty who guide with unerring hand who have so wonderfully apportioned out to animal mean of providing for not only external inward structure of animal show such variety ingenuity to surmount difficulty to afford enjoyment nature be capable of after examination rise with increased astonishment admiration at condescension goodness of master hand thus to calculate provide for necessity of smallest insect be compelled to exclaim with psalmist o god how manifold be thy work in wisdom hast thou made ' certainly do put study in new most pleasurable light replied alexander more search into nature more wonderful do find secret by aid of chemistry be continually making new discovery observe mr wilmot said swinton picking up straw have be blown by wind on quarter deck do consider that there be analogy between straw flint in lock of gun certainly must imagine a opposite particle of nature a well might be such be not case piece of wheat straw contains more than sixty per cent of silica flint in composition so although vegetable be nearly two third composed of hardest mineral substance know of must scarcely believe that fiber of root of plant be capable of dissolving feeding upon digesting such hard substance so be be very wonderful be be not solitary instance phosphate of lime be chief component part of bone of animal be equally sought by plant dissolved in same manner taken into body barley oat have about thirty per cent of in composition most wood plant have more le be le surprised at than be with flint appears almost incomprehensible nothing be impossible with god there be rush in holland contains much more silex than wheat straw be employed by dutch to polish wood brass on very account know little yet do know that mineral substance be found in composition of most living animal if not indeed coloring matter of blood be oxide phosphate of iron can now understand why be so enthusiastic in science mr swinton regret much that short time will be occupied in remainder of voyage will not enable to profit a must wish by conversation for when arrive at cape fear pursuit will lead different way presume will for be about to penetrate a far a possible into interior of country replied mr swinton of course be not intention indeed be replied alexander be about to do same although perhaps not in same direction may ask intended route if not too inquisitive not at can hardly say will be guided by protection may fall in with africa be wide field for science can hardly go where without being well rewarded for journey will say must meet view must be very glad if be to travel in company mr fairburn who have come on deck have be standing close to at latter portion of conversation made observation think must be very good plan if mr swinton must venture to go where be bound mr wilmot can talk of day when have be longer together there be nothing requires more deliberation than choice of traveling companion serious imperfection of temper may make journey very miserable now wilmot if be tired of natural history wish to change for painful history of human nature be ready to continue observation with great pleasure sir hope have objection to reaping benefit also said mr swinton oh most certainly not replied mr fairburn although fear will not gain much information a have be at cape before in former conversation with mr wilmot have pointed out manner in cape be first settled how settler have gradually reduced original possessor of land to state of serfdom will now continue dutch boor a increased wealth in cattle required more pasture be now occupying whole of land south of caffre country caffre be wild courageous savage whose wealth consists chiefly in cattle in point may be considered superior to hottentot weapon of hottentot may be said to be bow arrow caffre scorn warfare indeed treachery weapon be assaguay spear shield fight openly bravely caffre also cultivate land to certain extent be more cleanly civilized boor on caffre frontier be often plundered by bushman perhaps occasionally by few of caffre who be in lawless state on frontier if complaint be made to caffre chief redress in power be given however did not suit dutch boor have entered caffre country have perceived that caffre possessed large herd of cattle avarice pointed out to how much easier must be to grow rich by taking cattle of caffre than by rearing if bushman stole few head of cattle complaint be immediately forwarded to cape town permission asked to raise force recover from caffre force raised be termed commando be composed of dutch boor servant well armed mounted must make incursion into caffre territory because few head of cattle have be stolen by party unknown must pour down upon caffre who have assaguays to oppose to destructive fire arm set kraal village in flame murder indiscriminately man woman child carry off by way of indemnification for trifling loss perhaps twenty thousand head of cattle belonging to caffre caffre naturally indignant at such outrage robbery made attack upon boor to recover cattle with difference between christian boor untutored savage boor murdered woman child wantonly caffre never harmed did not even kill men if must obtain possession of property without bloodshed how must dutch government permit such atrocity representation made to government be believed order be given in consequence be true afterward government attempted to put stop to horror boor be beyond control in one instance in home government have insisted that punishment must be inflicted for more than common outrage on part of boor cape governor returned for answer that must not venture to do a wished a system be so extensive so common that principal people in colony be implicated must have to be punished such be therefore condition of colony at time that fell into possession of english hottentot serf to land treated a beast of field slave trader supplying slave continual war carried on between boor caffre trust that government soon put end to such barbarous iniquity be not so easy frontier boor rose in arm against english government hottentot who have be so long patient now fled joined caffre people made combined attack upon frontier boor burned house to ground carried off cattle possessed of arm ammunition boor rallied in great force combat took place in hottentot caffre be victorious killing leader of boor pursuing with great slaughter till be stopped by advance of english troop can not dwell long upon period of cape history war continued until native throwing upon protection of english be induced to lay down arm hottentot to return to former master colony be then given up to dutch remained with until year when be finally annexed to british empire dutch have not learned wisdom from what have occurred treated hottentot worse than before maiming even murdering in resentment appeared to defy british government change be soon to take place not before be necessary at event said alexander be by missionary chiefly that change be brought about have penetrated into interior saw with own eye system of cruelty rapine be carried on wrote home account be credited produced great alteration to astonishment indignation of boor law be introduced where have always be set at defiance be told that life of hottentot be a important in eye of god in eye of law a of dutch boor that government must hold a such thus be first blow struck heavier be soon to fall upon who have so long sported with life of fellow creature press be called to aid of hottentot work published by missionary roused attention of public at home to situation cause be pleaded in house of common hottentot be emancipated forever thank god exclaimed alexander blood have be boiling at description have be giving now when hear that poor hottentot be free man will cool down again perhaps will be a well to leave off just now mr wilmot said mr fairburn will renew conversation to morrow if wind weather permit a seaman say chapter v next day ship be off rio immediately sent boat for provision supply passenger did not land a captain stated that must not stay hour longer than be necessary on second evening after arrival again made sail for cape gull be flying in number astern of ship darting down seizing thing edible be thrown overboard conversation turned upon aquatic bird what difference be there in feather of aquatic bird others inquired alexander hen land bird if fall into water be drowned a soon a feather be saturated with water there be believe difference in feather of bird replied mr swinton aquatic bird be provided with small reservoir containing oil with anoint feather render water proof if will watch duck pluming dressing will find continually turn bill round to end of back just above insertion of tail be to procure oil a dress feather that may carefully overlap other smear upon so a to render impenetrable to water requires frequent renewal duck must be drowned a well a hen how long can sea bird remain at sea must think not very long although have be supposed otherwise know so much of habit of bird a of others can remain long under water greater portion of can not duck that class for instance diver can remain time bird remain longest under water be semi aquatic whose foot be only half webbed have watched common english water hen for many minute walking along at bottom of stream apparently a much in element a if on shore pecking feeding a walked say that aquatic bird can not remain long at sea where do go to resort to uninhabited island over globe rock that always remain above water unfrequented shore of africa elsewhere there congregate to breed bring up young have seen twenty thirty acre of land completely covered with bird nest wedged together a close a must sit year resort to same spot have probably be domicile for century might say since creation make nest merely scrape so a to form willow hole to deposit egg consequence of always resorting to same spot be that from voiding of bird remains of fish brought to feed young deposit be made over whole surface fraction of inch year by degree increase until be sometimes twenty thirty foot deep if not more lower portion becomes almost a hard a rock deposit be termed guano have from time immemorial be used by peruvian chilians a manure for land be very powerful a contains most of essential salt such a ammonia phosphate etc be required for agriculture within last few year sample have be brought to england a quantity must be inexhaustible when be sought for found doubt may one day become valuable article of carrying trade here come mr fairburn hope intends to continue notice of cape settlement have interested very much must confess appears well acquainted with colony have have advantage of long residence during time insight into public document may be certain of that know more than will tell a soon a mr fairburn joined alexander requested to continue narrative did a follows must not suppose mr wilmot that because english have now possession of colony thing went right governor who be appointed to control of colony require to be there time before can see with own eye must from want of information fall into hand of interested party who will sway council thus be at cape be true that much good have already be done by abolition of slavery emancipation of hottentot be effected not by colonial government by representation of missionary influential benevolent party at home prejudice against hottentot particularly caffre still existed be imbibed by colonial authority commando a must be more properly termed marauding party be still sent out caffre be continually oppressed in defiance of government order little justice must be obtained for hottentot although situation be somewhat improved will give one instance to show how right of hottentot be respected by cape authority in previous to emancipation be true still at time when position of hottentot suffering have be strenuously pressed upon colonial authority by government at home when conduct of dutch boor have roused caffre hottentot to war there be three brother by name of stuurman hottentot who be leader peace be at length restored be chiefly effected by exertion of men who retired peaceably with own kraal to algoa bay government being then dutch appointed stuurman a captain of kraal independent horde of hottentot gave great offense to dutch boor more so a three brother have be leader of hottentot in former insurrection for seven year must find complaint to make against until at last two of hottentot who have engaged to serve boor for certain time went back to kraal at expiration of term against wish of boor who must have detained boor went demanded back stuurman refused to give up upon although justice be clearly on side of hottentot armed force be dispatched to kraal stuurman still refused to surrender men armed men retired for knew courage of hottentot be afraid to attack by treachery gained possession of stuurman one of brother other having be killed hunting buffalo sent to cape town from whence against justice be sent a prisoner to robin island where malefactor be confined made escape returned to caffreland three year afterward stuurman anxious to see family returned to colony without permission be discovered apprehended sent a convict to new south wale for government be at time english such be fate of first hottentot who stood up for right of countryman such be conduct of english colonial government so will observe mr wilmot although stride of cruelty oppression be most rapid return to even handed justice be equally slow eventually gross injustice to man be acknowledged for order from home government be procured for liberation return be too late stuurman have died convict have mentioned circumstance a will prepare for similar act of injustice to caffre when colony be in possession of dutch there be space of about thirty thousand square mile between colonial boundary be land formerly possessed by hottentot great fish river extent of thirty thousand square mile belonged to caffre be site of continual skirmishing marauding between dutch boor caffre in be resolved by colonial government that caffre must be driven from territory confined to other side of great fish river be act of injustice great hardship be proceeded in with extreme cruelty caffre being obliged to leave crop turned out with great unnecessary slaughter may be proper however to state cause led to caffre war with english at time colonial governor have entered into negotiation with caffre chief of name of gaika be chief of portion of caffre not principal chief although english treated with a caffre must not acknowledge authority be very frequent error committed in intercourse with savage nation who be a pertinacious of right a monarch of europe error on part be soon discovered government be too proud to acknowledge so happened that other caffre chief formed powerful confederacy against gaika who trusting to support of english have treated with great arrogance fought conquered carrying off a usual cattle a be war between caffre confined to own land certainly have business to interfere colonial government thought otherwise expedition be prepared caffre sent forward messenger declaring wish to remain at peace with english refusing to submit to gaika who be only secondary chief whom have conquered no regard be paid to remonstrance english troop be sent forward caffre attacked in hamlet slaughtered driven into wood head of cattle taken from of be given to gaika rest distributed to dutch boor sold to defray part of expense of expedition deprived of mean of subsistence by capture of cattle caffre be rendered furious reckless sooner have expedition returned than commenced hostility poured into frontier district captured several detached military fort drove dutch boor from zurweld neutral territory killed great many of soldier of dutch boor country be overrun a far a vicinity of algoa bay nothing must at first check progress why really doe not appear that colonial government when in hand be more considerate than when be held by dutch replied alexander not much fear said mr fairburn council of caffre chief be at time much influenced by most remarkable personage of name of mokanna in colony be usually known by sobriquet of 'links left handed be not chief have by superior intellect obtained great power gave out to be prophet certainly showed quite a much skill a ever did mahommed other false prophet have often visited cape town have made master of that must acquire of european knowledge man by influence superior eloquence pretended revelation from heaven be now looked up to by whole caffre nation promised chief if must implicitly obey order must lead to victory that must drive english into ocean resolved upon bold measure of making attack upon graham town marched army of between nine ten thousand men to forest bordering on great fish river according to custom of caffre who never use surprise ambush on great occasion sent message to commandant of graham town stating that must breakfast with next morning commandant who have supposed message to be mere bravado be very ill prepared when on following morning perceived to great astonishment whole force of caffre on height above town have caffre advanced in night there be doubt that must have have possession of place that with greatest ease there be about regular troop small force of hottentot in graham town fortunately few field piece caffre rushed to assault for time be not to be checked went up to very muzzle of field piece broke spear off short to decide battle by hand to hand conflict at critical moment field piece opened fire of grape canister front rank of caffre be mowed down like grass after several rallying under mokanna caffre gave way fled about of bravest remained on field of battle a many more perished from wound before must regain country mokanna after using exertion accompanied caffre army in flight certainly be bold attempt on part of caffre showed mokanna to be great man even in failure be so unprecedented attempt that colonial government be dreadfully alarmed turned out whole force of militia a well a of regular troop caffre country be again overrun inhabitant destroyed without distinction of age sex hamlet fired cattle driven away when fled to thicket be bombarded with shell congreve rocket mokanna principal chief be denounced a outlaw inhabitant threatened with utter extermination if did not deliver up dead alive although driven to despair perishing from want not single caffre be to be found who must earn high reward offered for surrender of chief more hear of more admire caffre observed alexander wilmot may add never mind pray go on think must supply word have checked mr wilmot will proceed dinner will be announced before have finished portion of history course adopted by mokanna under circumstance be such a will raise much higher in estimation a found that countryman be to be massacred until other chief be delivered up dead alive resolved to surrender a hostage for country sent message to say that must do so next day with calm magnanimity must have done honor to roman patriot came unattended to english camp word be 'people say have occasioned war let see if delivering up will restore peace to country ' commanding officer to whom surrendered immediately forwarded a prisoner to colony what became of of hereafter wish here to give substance of speech made by one of mokanna head men who came after mokanna surrender into english camp be told that imperfect note taken of afford very faint idea of eloquence at event speech give very correct view of treatment caffre received from hand war ' said 'british chief be unjust one for be trying to extirpate people whom have forced to take up arm when father father of boor first settled on zurweld dwelt together in peace flock grazed same hill herdsman smoked out of same pipe be brother until herd of amakosa caffre increased so much a to make heart of dutch boor sore what covetous men must not get from father for old button took by force father be men loved cattle wife child lived upon milk fought for property began to hate colonist who coveted aimed at destruction kraal father kraal be separate boor made commando for father father drove out of zurweld dwelt there because have conquered there married wife there child be born white men hated must not drive away when there be war plundered when there be peace of bad people stole chief forbade 'we lived in peace bad people stole perhaps nation be quiet gaika stole chief stole sent copper sent bead sent horse on rode to steal more to only sent commando quarreled with gaika about grass business of yours send commando take last cow leave only few calf die for want so do child give spoil to gaika half kept yourselves milk corn destroyed saw wife child perish followed therefore track of cattle into colony plundered fought for life found weak destroyed soldier saw that be strong attacked headquarters if have succeeded right be good for began war failed be here wish for peace wish to rest in hut wish to get milk for child wife wish to till land troop cover plain swarm in thicket where can not distinguish men from woman shoot wish to submit to gaika man face be fair to heart be false leave to make peace with let fight for will not call upon for help set mokanna at liberty chief will make peace with at time fix if still make war may indeed kill last man of gaika will not rule over follower of who think woman if eloquence consists a doe not in english house of common in saying much in few word know speech more comprehensive of fact argument of case than above be sorry to say have effect in altering destination of mokanna of obtaining relief for countryman who be still called upon to deliver up other chief outlawed by government before remarked absurdity of expression said mr swinton outlaw member of own society belonging to own country to outlaw chief of country be something too absurd fear english language be not much studied at cape at event attempt made to obtain possession of outlawed chief be unavailing after plundering country of must be found in leaving devastation misery behind expedition returned without obtaining object with satisfaction of knowing that by taking away more cattle left thousand of woman child to die of starvation must leave off now result of war fate of mokanna will be subject of meeting be much obliged to mr fairburn for interesting narrative have given be however to be hoped that will have more such painful error injustice to dwell upon a before observed mr wilmot requires time for prejudice falsehood to be overthrown until be mastered can not be expected that justice can be administered colonial government have to contend with whole white population of colony who rose up in arm against considering from long habit that interference with assumed despotism over native be infringement of right must also recollect how weak be power of colonial government for long time how impossible be to exert power over extensive country to give idea of will state be reply of of dutch boor to traveler la vaillant when latter expressed opinion that government must interfere with armed force to put end to cruelty oppression 'be aware ' said 'what must be result of attempt assembling in instant must massacre half of soldier salt flesh send back by might spare with threat to do same thing to who must be bold enough to appear among afterward ' be not easy task for government to deal with set of people mr wilmot grant replied alexander conviction make more anxious to know what have be since done chapter vi following morning wind be very slight before noon fell calm two shark of large size came under stern of vessel sailor be soon very busy trying to hook one of refused bait be piece of salt pork after hour quitted vessel disappeared much to disappointment of passenger ship company former wishing very much to see shark caught latter very anxious to cut up fry for supper thought that shark always took bait observed alexander not always a have now seen replied mr swinton depends upon whether be hungry not in harbor where there be plenty of fish have seen shark in hundred not only refused bait must not attempt to seize man if be in water be surprised at atlantic shark refusing bait must confess for be generally very ravenous a be indeed shark be found in ocean can tell sir why refused bait said boatswain of vessel who be standing by be because be now on track of brazilian slaver have be well fed lately depend upon must not be surprised if be correct in idea replied mr swinton there be many variety of shark be there not inquired wilmot yes great many fiercest however largest kind be one have just left be termed white shark range whole atlantic ocean be seldom found far to northward a prefers tropic be however to be seen in mediterranean in gulf of lyon be there remarkably fierce in english channel find blue shark be seldom dangerous there be also very large sized harmless shark found in north sea whaler frequent then there be spotted tiger shark be very savage although doe not grow to large size hammer headed shark so called from peculiar formation of head ground shark perhaps most dangerous of a lie at bottom rise under without giving notice of approach believe have now mentioned principal variety if man be to fall overboard shark be nigh what must be best plan to act upon be if there must be chance of escape from such brute best plan have seen acted upon with success be if can swim well to throw on back splash a much a can with foot halloo a loud a can shark be cowardly animal noise will drive away when went out two three year ago have newfoundland dog be accustomed to leap into water from almost height be very partial to may imagine annoyance when one day a be becalmed along western island large shark came up alongside dog at once perceiving plunged off taffrail to seize swimming toward shark barking a loud a must fully expected that monster must have dispatched in moment to surprise shark be frightened swam away followed by dog until boat be lowered down picked up think shark must have be very hungry probably not at event must not have liked to have be in neptune place think most peculiar plan of escaping from shark be that pursued by cingalese diver often with success tell if please diver who go down for pearl oyster off ceylon generally drop from boat descend in ten twelve fathom of water before come to bed of pearl oyster be upon bank of mud often happens that when be down shark make for hardly need say that poor fellow be constantly on watch looking in direction while be filling basket if perceive shark making for only chance be to stir up mud on bank a fast a can prevents animal from distinguishing under cover of clouded water regain surface nevertheless doe not always answer many be taken off year lady proud of pearl necklace little think how many poor fellow may have be torn to piece to obtain for such ornament very true when consider how many pearl fishery may have taken place how many diver may have be destroyed before string of fine pearl can be obtained might almost say that pearl on necklace have cost life of human creature how be pearl disposed of who be proprietor government be proprietor of fishery believe whether farm out yearly not can not tell know that a pearl oyster be taken be landed unopened packed upon beach in square of certain dimension when fishing be over for season square lot of pearl oyster be put up to auction sold to highest bidder of course 'contents unknown ' so that becomes specie of lottery purchaser may not find single pearl in lot may find two three will realize twenty time price have paid for lot be then lottery from beginning to end poor diver lottery be shark shark purchaser pearl pearl mr fairburn be coming up ladder be anxious to know what be fate of mokanna mr fairburn who have come on deck on purpose to continue narrative took seat by two fellow passenger went on a follows stated that mokanna have be forwarded to cape must have perceived that only crime be that of fighting for native land against civilized invader be deep crime in eye of colonial government be immediately thrown into common gaol finally be condemned to be imprisoned for life on robben island place appropriated for detention of convicted felon other malefactor who there work in iron at slate quarry may ask where be robben island be island few mile from mainland close to table bay upon cape town be built mokanna remained there about year when having made intention known to caffre who be confined there with contrived out of iron hoop of cask to make weapon like cutlass with armed follower rose upon guard overpowered then seized boat with caffre made for mainland unfortunately in attempting to disembark upon rock of mainland boat be upset in surf be very violent mokanna clung time to rock at last be washed off thus perished unfortunate leader of caffre poor fellow said alexander deserved better fate more generous enemy did war continue ended in manner way worthy of in be begun recollect that war be commenced to support gaika selected chief of caffre against real chief caffre have before be compelled to give up territory on side of fish river colonial government now insisted upon retiring still further be beyond keisi chumi river by more square mile be added to colonial territory be exacted in order that there might be neutral ground to separate caffre dutch boor put end to further robbery on side strangest part of story be that territory be not taken away from caffre chief against whom have made war from gaika ally to support whom have entered into war well be even handed not justice injustice at event exactly so so thought gaika for when speaking of protection received from colonial government said 'but when look upon large extent of fine country have be taken from be compelled to say that although protected be rather oppressed by protector unjust a be mode of obtaining neutral ground must say that appears to to have be good policy to put one between party grant what be conduct of colonial government neutral ground be afterward given away in large tract to dutch boor so a again to bring into contact with caffre be possible yes to men who have always be opposed to english government who have twice risen in rebellion against who have tried to bring in caffre to destroy colony be commando excursion against caffre put end to makomo son of gaika late ally have hear be party now attacked trust however that may soon have affair going on in more favorable reputable manner indeed be sure now government at home have be put in possession of fact such will be case have now given very brief insight into history of cape up to present time there be many point have passed over not wishing to diverge from straightforward narrative upon question may wish to ask will be most happy to give information in power can not however dismiss subject without making one remark be that be principally if not wholly to missionary to exertion to representation that what good have be done be to be attributed be entitled to greatest credit warmest praise great a have be misrule of colony for many year must have be much greater much more disgraceful if have not be for effort very important alteration have be taking place in colony will eventually be productive of much good refer to british immigration year becomes more extensive a soon a british population exceeds master of old dutch planter boor will have better feeling in colony suppose that dutch boor be such a whose conduct have be obliged to point out there be many worthy men although few educated enlightened know from own observation that failing prejudice against native be fast fading away that lately law have be able to hold ground have be supported by people inhabiting district dutch with prejudice vice will soon be swallowed up by inundation of english settler will gradually be so incorporated intermingled by marriage that distinction will be known time however be required for such consolidation cementation that time be arriving fast future prospect of cape be a cheering a may think from narrative have be disheartening gloomy trust in god that such will be case replied alexander if wind continues in few day will be at cape will be most anxious to hear how affair be going on have letter just before set out from england stating that zoolu tribe to northward of caffre be in unquiet state a must pas near to tribe on journey be anxious to know truth at event chaka be dead be murdered about two year back by own relation who be chaka inquired alexander have yet to tell at present have only got a far a caffre who be immediately on frontier chapter vii wind continued fair vessel rapidly approached cape alexander who have contracted great friendship for mr swinton have made known to cause of intended journey into interior latter volunteered if company must not be displeasing to accompany alexander on tedious somewhat perilous expedition alexander gladly accepted offer requested mr swinton must put to expense a have unlimited command of money from grand uncle mr swinton joining caravan must make difference in arrangement after have be agreed that must travel together continued subject of discourse discussion be nature of outfit number of wagon equipment store number of horse ox must provided be busy day adding to memoranda a to what must be advisable to procure for journey mr fairburn often joined in discussion gave advice told that when arrived at cape town might be more useful to alexander who a have before observed be keen hunter very partial to horse dog promised much pleasure in chase of wild animal on journey congratulated upon being so well provided with gun rifle have brought with more with idea that might be required for self defense than for sport at last land ho be cried out by man who be at mast head in morning watch soon afterward flat top of table mountain be distinctly visible from deck surprise running before fresh breeze soon neared land so that object on might be perceived with glass at noon be well in for bay before three o'clock surprise be brought to anchor between two other merchant vessel be filling up home cargo after three month voyage passenger be rather anxious to get on shore therefore before night be landed alexander found comfortably domiciled in one of best house in cape town for mr fairburn have during passage requested alexander to take up abode with tired with excitement of day be not sorry to go to bed early did not forget to return thanks to who have preserved through peril of voyage next morning mr fairburn said to alexander mr wilmot must recommend for first ten day to think nothing about journey amuse with seeing public garden other thing worthy of inspection if plea can make ascent of table mountain with friend swinton at event do just a please will find people attentive ready to obey order know hour of meal consider at home a much master here a be a may well imagine after so long absence have much to attend to in official capacity think will be week ten day before will be comfortably reseated in office have thing going on smoothly a ought to do must therefore excuse if be not quite so attentive host at first a must wish to be one thing only recommend to do at present be to accompany afternoon to government house may introduce to governor be just a well to get over mark of respect be due to then will be own master alexander replied with many thanks be graciously received by governor who promised assistance in power in prosecution of journey having received invitation

introduced a major henderson have arrived few day before from calcutta having obtained leave of absence for recovery of health after smart jungle fever have nearly proved fatal voyage however have completely reinstated appeared full of life spirit walked together to company garden in be few lion other cape animal discourse naturally turned upon major henderson described hunting in india especially tiger hunting on elephant to be very partial alexander soon discovered that be talking to one who be passionately fond of sport after long conversation parted mutually pleased with other day two afterward mr swinton who have be talking about intended journey with alexander said to must not be surprised at off hand unceremonious way have in colony people meeting abroad even englishman occasionally throw aside much ceremony mention because major henderson intends to call afternoon propose joining party into interior know much of have heard much said in favor be easy to see by manner address that be gentleman of course when stated intention must hing refer to did what do think wilmot think very well of major henderson consider a journey must be one of peril more european better especially when can find one who be used to danger from profession also to dangerous hunting must also expect so far from not wishing to join consider most valuable acquisition be delighted at idea well be glad to hear say so for agree with be hunting mad be certain hear most remarkable shot think with will be acquisition appears that be intention to have gone into interior even if went by have two arab horse brought with from india with view if see before come may say that have stated wish to that be quite delighted at joining party being perfectly understood that be at expense for thing connected with outfit will tell so replied swinton think sooner begin to collect what be necessary better must have major henderson in council depend upon will be very useful very active so for present farewell mr swinton major henderson called together that afternoon latter a soon a be admitted into party began to talk over plan preparation suite be not very large said have two horse two

monkey besides be young full of trick like something to amuse baboon have good quality give notice of danger sooner than dog observed swinton think wilmot must admit monkey into party will be most happy replied alexander laughing pray give compliment major henderson say how happy will be call begum said major henderson because be so like old begum princess whom be once attending when in india with troop a guard of honor must look out for good horse mr wilmot will want great many if wish to have sore back let hottentot ride have be discussing point major henderson a to whether will not be better to go round in vessel to algoa bay complete equipment there make starting place if do will save long journey by land find not very far from what understand be best of hunting ground near to country of vaal river topic then dwelt upon be what article must procure in cape town what must defer providing with until arrival at algoa bay agreed to provide store at cape town a many good horse a must select wagon ox hiring of hottentot put off until arrived at algoa bay mr fairburn be now more at leisure alexander have more of society one evening after dinner mr fairburn have opened map of country to give alexander information relative to projected journey pointed out to track appeared most advisable through caffre country then observed that be difficult to give advice a to proceeding after have passed country governed by hinza a thing must depend upon circumstance do know thing of country beyond not much know that be overrun by zoolus tribe of chaka be chief last year troop went to assistance of caffre who be attacked by tribe from northward called mantatees be dispersed by troop with immense slaughter zoolu country perceive be on east side of great chain of mountain to northward of port natal mantatees came from west side of mountain in about same parallel of latitude be impossible to say what may be going on at present what may take place before arrive at destination a northern irruption be continual promised history of person chaka will have now be king of zoolu nation hardly know what to call be nero napoleon of africa monster in cruelty crime yet great warrior conqueror commenced career by murdering relative to obtain sovereignty a soon a have succeeded murdered whom thought inimical to who have be friend to relative be zoolus caffre there be many race to northward consider a caffre race may have observed in history of world that migration of human race be generally from north to south so appears to have be in convulsion among northern tribe probably pressure from excessive population have driven zoolus to southward came down like inundation sweeping before tribe fell in path chaka force consisted of nearly warrior of whom be always in attendance to execute order in country overran spared age sex be one indiscriminate slaughter what monster ruled by terror be incredible that order met with such implicit obedience to make army invincible remodeled divided into company distinguished by color of shield forbade to use other weapon short stabbing spear so that always fought at close quarter weeded army by picking out of veteran warrior who have gained victory putting to death regiment sent out to battle if be defeated be instantly destroyed on return be therefore victory death with death be most cruel being that of impalement well be surnamed 'the bloody ' yes indeed tyranny over own people be dreadful on one occasion child annoyed ordered to be killed child ran among seventy eighty other child must not be distinguished so ordered whole to be put to death murdered two three hundred of wife in one day at slightest suspicion must order out chief to execution one knew when turn might come will be law one trembled obeyed to enter into detail of cruelty must fill volume will be sufficient to mention last act of life mother died declared that have perished by witchcraft hundred hundred be impaled at last tired of slow proceeding ordered out army to indiscriminate slaughter over whole country lasted for fourteen day how horrible be demon who reveled in blood own turn came at last be murdered by brother dingaam who knew that be about to be sacrificed thus perished bloody chaka brother dingaam be now on zoolu throne appears inclined to be quiet there be great warrior chief named moselekatsee who revolted from chaka who be much such character account of people be vague at present require time to corroborate correctness will have to act decide when arrive there must be guided by circumstance with caravan propose to travel with think there will not be much danger if there be must retreat favor of despot be easily to be obtained by judicious present of course will not be unprovided with have ordered letter to authority to be made out will have governor signature to when do propose to start will be ready in few day have only to find vessel going to algoa bay will be asked to take charge of several article be to be sent to missionary station will pas on way presume have objection certainly not deserve encouragement kindness attention can show will give great pleasure alexander received many proposal from different party who wished to join expedition be civilly declined in few day vessel arrived be about to go round to settlement at algoa bay store horse dog not forgetting begum baboon be embarked taking leave of mr fairburn governor alexander major henderson mr swinton embarked on evening of fourth day found safe at anchor in company with ten twelve vessel be lying in

landed greater proportion be still on board of vessel debarkation be rapidly going on whole bay be covered with boat landing with people store returning for more wind blowing from westward there be surf on beach sun be bright warm scene be busy interesting night came on panorama be closed in alexander companion remained on deck of vessel till undisturbed silence reigned where hour two before be noise bustle star so beautiful in southern clime shone out in cloudless brilliancy water of bay be smooth a glass reflected so clearly that might have fancied that there be heaven beneath a well a above land presented dark opaque mass mountain in distance appearing a if be close to rising precipitately from shore be of one somber hue except where light in house in town twinkled here there announcing that have not yet dismissed worldly care sought repose from labor of day yet be silent except occasionally barking of dog voice of sentry in fort frederick announcing that be well what gathering in small space of so many people with so many different history so many cause for leaving native land with so many different fortune in store for must there be on board of emigrant ship observed mr swinton yet united in one feeling instigated by same desire that of independence if possible of wealth rejoined major henderson of that there can be doubt said alexander must be almost like beginning new life so many tie broken by vast ocean have separated new interest usurping place of old one novelty adventure to look forward to new scene added to new hope new fear must not remain too long even to watch beautiful heaven for must rise at daylight so will set example wish good night at daylight on following morning long boat be hoisted out horse safely conveyed on shore after

wife be fixture at little tea table day long never leaf tea be always ready for traveler who claim hospitality be odd custom presume occasion good woman to become so very lusty doubt of whole exercise of day be from bedroom to teapot back again replied swinton laughing one must hardly suppose that apparently good natured hospitable people must have be guilty of such cruelty to native a mr fairburn represented many of virtue vice be brought prominently forward by circumstance replied swinton hospitality in thinly inhabited country be universal dutch boor be hospitable to excess cruelty to hottentot other native arises from prejudice of education have from childhood beheld treated a slave consider a fellow creature a mr fairburn truly said nothing demoralizes so much so hardens heart of man a slavery existing sanctioned by law be not dutch renowned for cruelty love of money have obtained that reputation fear there be reason for took lead must be remembered a commercial nation more commercial than portuguese whose step followed so closely that eager pursuit of wealth must create love of money be too natural to obtain money men under influence of passion will stop at nothing cruelty in east be on record question be whether english who followed path of dutch must not have gone before have be guilty of same crime to obtain same end spaniard be just a cruel in south america portuguese have not fallen short of nay doubt if own countryman can be acquitted in many instance only difference be that other nation who preceded in discovery have greater temptation because there be more rich wealth to be obtained remark be just well may say in lord prayer 'lead not into temptation ' for be too frail to withstand at noon again unyoked allowed cattle to graze for interval after

little trouble with hottentot whom have hired a long a be within reach of law behaved well now that have passed confines of cape territory of began to show symptom of insubordination dismissal of one however with order to go back immediately threatening to shoot if be ever seen in caravan have desired effect of restoring order country be now series of hill dale occasionally of deep ravine route lay through path made by elephant be numerous hottentot of name of bremen who be considered a best man most practiced hunter begged alexander companion to be careful how went along if preceded rest on

inquired alexander elephant sir replied hottentot be well that did not charge must have tumbled down precipice horse there must be herd here have better stop a soon a be down other side of hill think so too replied major will not get that shriek out of ear for month said alexander why roar of lion can not be so bad wait till hear replied swinton have now arrived at bottom of hill have be passing

confinement since crossing fish river a usual when sat down came made one of party generally creeping in close to master until supper be served when must have finger in dish steal must sometimes

pantomime trying by gesture sign to talk to mr swinton companion endeavored to assist mahomed a much a must appeared to have attached to for kept company with hottentot be not more than three foot half high with limb remarkably delicate although well made face be very much like monkey gesture manner completely so be quite a active full of fun watch have be set a soon a fire be lighted close to where alexander others be seated big adam hottentot have mentioned a having raised doubt in mind of major a to courage have just mounted guard with gun in hand omrah came up to where be sitting nodded smiled at said how do do in english boy who have already picked up few sentence answered in same word how do do then pointing to big adam whose back be turned began making number of sign nodding head at last bent down putting arm in front of raising like elephant trunk walking with measured step of animal so a fully to make understand that intended to portray elephant having so done went up behind big adam gave shriek so exactly like elephant have given hour before that hottentot started up dropped musket threw flat on ground in order that supposed animal might pas by unperceived other hottentot have be equally startled have seized musket looking in direction for approach of animal convulsion of laughter proceeded from party soon told that there be nothing to apprehend little omrah have be playing trick big adam rose up looking very foolish have just before be telling companion how many elephant have killed have be expressing hope that soon must have elephant hunt well observed swinton after laugh be over prof that adam be elephant hunter know what to do in time of danger yes replied major also prof that opinion of be just that with best part of valor be discretion most wonderful escape from elephant have on record here observed swinton be that of lieutenant moodie did ever hear of have from own lip never did at event said alexander if major have will listen very patiently to oblige have never heard precise particular will therefore be a glad to be listener a wilmot well then will begin lieutenant moodie be out elephant hunting with party of officer soldier when one day be told that large troop of elephant be close at hand that several of men be out in pursuit of lieutenant moodie immediately seized gun went off in direction where heard firing have forced way through jungle have just come to cleared spot when heard of people calling out in english dutch 'take care mr moodie take care ' a called out heard crackling of branch broken by elephant a be bursting through wood then tremendous scream such a heard night immediately afterward four elephant burst out from jungle not two hundred yard from where stood being alone on open ground knew that if fired did not kill must have chance so hastily retreated hoping that animal must not see on looking back however perceived to dismay that be in chase of rapidly gaining on therefore resolved to reserve fire till last moment turning toward precipitous rock hoped to gain before elephant must come up with be still at least fifty pace from rock when found that elephant be within distance of one very large animal three smaller in row a if determined that must not escape snorting so tremendously that be quite stunned with noise be what call very pretty position observed major go on swinton affair be becoming little nervous a only chance lieutenant moodie turned round leveled gun at largest elephant unfortunately powder be damp gun hung fire till be in act of taking from shoulder when went off ball merely grazed side of elephant head animal halted for instant then made furious charge upon fell whether struck down by elephant trunk can not say elephant then thrust at a lay with tusk fortunately have one more fortunately missed mark plowing up ground within inch of mr moodie body animal then caught up with trunk by middle dashed down between fore foot to tread to death once pressed so heavily on chest that bone bent under weight somehow other whether from animal being in state of alarm never contrived to have whole weight upon for mr moodie have never lost recollection kept twisting body limb so a to prevent from obtaining direct tread upon while be in state of distress officer hottentot hunter came up to assistance fired several shot at animal be severely wounded other three took to heel at last one have possession of mr moodie turned round giving cuff with fore foot followed rest mr moodie got up picked up gun staggered away a fast a aching bone must permit met brother who have just be informed by one of hottentot who have seen under elephant that be killed well be escape observed wilmot what made more remarkable be that have hardly time to explain to brother miraculous preservation before witnessed death of one of hunter soldier who have attracted notice of large male elephant have be driven out of jungle fierce animal gave chase to caught immediately under height where mr moodie brother be standing carried poor fellow for distance on trunk then threw down stamping upon until be quite dead left body for short time elephant then returned a if to make sure of destruction for kneeled down on body kneaded with fore leg then rising seized again with trunk carried to edge of jungle hurled into bush dreadful have idea that there be such danger in elephant hunt yet must say continued alexander although may appear foolishness only make more anxious to have one well a advance will have want of opportunity will be better to get caffre to join will with great delight why have weapon except spear none will attack with great success a will see watch opportunity a pass get behind drive spear into body until animal be exhausted from loss of blood be so quick that elephant seldom be able to destroy one of consider elephant of a high rank a one of king be very laughable to hear a wound beg pardon of cry out 'great man be angry great captain kill ' how be that can approach so terrible animal without destruction be because do approach quite close to elephant see badly except straight before turn with difficulty caffre be within three foot of tail flank when attack attack in elephant path be too narrow for animal to turn without difficulty great risk that run be from elephant breaking out to assistance of one attacked animal do assist other then yes there be remarkable instance of in affair of lieutenant moodie mentioned that be large male elephant killed soldier just after mr moodie escape shortly afterward shot from one of hunter broke fore leg of animal prevented from running there stood to be fired at female elephant be in jungle witnessing distress of mate regardless of own danger immediately rushed out to assistance chasing away hunter walked round round mate constantly returning to side caressing when male attempted to walk have sagacity to place flank against wounded side so a to support help along at last female received severe wound staggered into bush where fell male be soon after laid prostrate by side of poor soldier whom have killed there be something very touching in last portion of story swinton observed alexander really make one feel sort of respect for such intelligent reasoning animal think first portion of story ought to teach to respect also said major seriously however quite agree with sagacity a indian experience have taught be wonderful here come supper be not sorry for replied alexander to morrow will be at missionary station if guide be correct be very anxious to get there must say doe not chief of amakosa tribe live close to mission house hinza a call yes replied swinton doe must have present ready for for think must be advisable to ask escort of warrior to go with after leave mission yes will be quite a well replied major then will have elephant hunting bremen tell that there be plenty of hippopotamus in river there close to mission water elephant replied swinton suppose will not leave alone certainly not if commander in chief will allow to stop think commander in chief replied wilmot be just a anxious to have day sport with a be major so will certainly have permission think ought to put omrah on horse be nice light weight for spare horse if required not bad idea replied alexander what tiger must make for cab in park more like monkey replied major be time to go to bed so good night chapter xi caravan proceeded on following morning by noon arrived at mission station of butterworth be about one hundred forty mile from colonial boundary station have only be settled about three year even in short time wore air of civilization strongly contrasted with savage country around mission house be little better than large cottage be true church sort of barn be surrounded by neat caffre hut garden full of produce on arrival of caravan mr s missionary came out to meet traveler to welcome have be informed that must call at station bring article have be sent for hardly need be said that meeting at place in such country party soon became on intimate term mr s offered bed accommodation in house traveler refused be well satisfied with own having unyoked ox turned out to graze with belonging to station accepted missionary invitation to join repast alexander having stated object of expedition requested advice of mr s a to further proceeding asked whether must not be advisable to see caffre king make present mr s strongly advised to do to ask for party of caffre to accompany caravan must not only insure safety must prove in many respect very useful must be necessary must be to find in food to promise present if conducted well be aware continued that hinza domain only extends a far a bashee st john river will have to proceed beyond with of caffre warrior will have difficulty a tribe further will not only fear strength also anger of hinza must commit depredation thing regret to say look very peaceable just now indeed what be quarrel with whom hinza have quarreled with powerful neighboring chief of name of voosani who reign over tambookie tribe about cattle be grand cause of quarrel in country party be preparing for war whether will take place be doubtful a be threatened with more powerful enemy may probably be compelled to unite in order to defend who may that be chief of amaquibi be in arm with large force threatens other tribe to northward of if conquers will certainly come down here be formerly one of chaka general be like renowned for slaughter at present be too far to northward to interfere with must advise to lose time in effecting mission for must advance will be compelled to retreat immediately have better send to hinza to morrow to let know that stranger have come wish to see that may make present that notice will bring fast enough not that well know be here have known that have be in country long ago will be a well after information have given said mr swinton what be opinion of caffre mr s now that have resided so long with be for heathen fine nation bold frank if thing be confided to scrupulously honest cattle stealing be certainly not considered crime among although be punished a one speaking a minister of gospel must say be most difficult nation to have thing to do with ever have be lot to visit have religion whatever have idol idea of existence of god when have talked to about reply be 'where be show to ' have superstition believe in necromancy have conjurer who do much harm be chief opponent a weaken influence consequently profit if cattle be stolen be referred to if chief be sick be sent for to know who have bewitched must of course mention innocent person who be sacrificed immediately if country be parched from want of rain so frequently be then conjurer be in great demand be sent for to produce rain if after pretended mystery rain doe not fall so a to save reputation give plausible reason generally ending however in sacrifice of innocent individual thus go on making excuse after excuse until rain doe fall obtain credit of need hardly say that people be greatest enemy be satisfied with success have have yes be when consider difficulty to be surmounted nothing divine assistance must have produced such effect a have already taken place chief be to man opposed to why so because christianity strike at root of sensuality be same when be first preached by divine master rich of caffre consist not only in cattle in number of wife who be slave to tell polygamy be unlawful wrong be therefore almost a much a to tell that be not right to hold large herd of cattle a chief be of course opulent of nation oppose observe in caffreland a elsewhere be 'hard for rich man to enter into kingdom of heaven have asked chief why will not come to church reply have be 'the great word be calculated to lessen pleasure diminish number of wife to can never consent ' still say have made progress if have let be ascribed to lord not to otherwise useless endeavor must be doing without aid assistance difficulty must have be insurmountable be for only to bear in mind scriptural injunction 'in morning sow thy seed in evening withhold not thy hand for thou knowest not whether will prosper that whether will be alike good ' have idea whatever of supreme being bad good have idea a of african tribe have of devil none in language have word to express idea of deity swear by king of former day a great chief more now if have religion might by pointing out to falsity absurdity of religion putting in juxtaposition with revealed truth have hold upon mind have not even that advantage can not make impression upon mind by referring to wonder of nature by asking who made sun star surely might be induced to reflect by such method have tried hundred time have laughed at for fable a have termed one of chief told to hold tongue that people might not think mad scripture indeed teach that without aid of direct revelation men be also without excuse if fail to attain to certain knowledge of deity eternal power god head ' by devout contemplation of visible world with wonder be spread out before a open volume beyond knowledge of origin manner of creation be derived not from deduction of human reasoning from divine testimony for be expressly said 'through faith understand that world be made by word of god ' nevertheless must admit that among civilized nation of europe many who deny revelation treat bible a fable acknowledge that world must have be made by supreme power dear sir many affect to deny truth of revelation out of pride folly who still in conscience can not believe here there being belief in deity will not be persuaded that world be made by one indeed have much to contend with perhaps one of greatest difficulty be in translation of scripture sit down with interpreter who can not read single word with perhaps most erroneous imperfect knowledge of divine thing open sacred volume be first translated into barbarous dutch to caffre interpreter who then have to tell how dutch be to be put into caffre language now may imagine what mistake may arise have found out lately have be stating very contrary to what must have said with translation stand up to read portion of word of god for interpreter can not read hence slight defect change in syllable may give altogether different sense from what desire to inculcate must indeed be great difficulty require long residence full acquaintance with language to overcome even then not overcome for language have word to express abstract idea lord work after own way at own season then despair of success god forbid must be indeed most unworthy servant of divine master if so far distrusted power no much good have be already done a will perceive when meet to morrow to perform divine service there be much more to do with blessing will in own good time be perfected have duty to attend to call away for present will therefore wish good night at event mission have have one good effect be perfectly safe from caffre violence caffre robbery homage be paid to even by king chief will say that if be only to judge by little have seen mission appears to have done good observed major in first place be no longer persecuted a have be during journey for present a may observe many of caffre about be clothed in european fashion who have nothing national undress may call wear a decently a can made same observation said alexander be most anxious for to morrow a wish to see how caffre behave really when consider difficulty mr s have mentioned be wonderful that who have embraced same calling must persevere a do dear wilmot replied mr swinton missionary even of most humble class be person of ordinary mind doe not rely upon upon own exertion relies not upon others upon assistance of world if did must a say soon abandon task in despair be supported be encouraged be pressed on by faith faith in who never desert who trust believe in know that if be pleasure task will be easy at same time that must be at own good time convinced of supported by encouraged by venturing life for toil on in full assurance that if fails be to succeed that if becomes martyr blood will moisten arid soil from future seed will spring missionary may be low in birth low in education a many be must be man of exalted mind what in other pursuit might term enthusiast in spreading of divine word merit respect for fervor courage devotion willingness if lord must so think fit to accept crown of martyrdom be right swinton nothing what have described must impel man to pas life of privation danger among savage race leaving following master in true apostolic sense well will have reward yes in heaven wilmot not on earth replied swinton next day being sabbath with assistance of mahomed who be valet a well a cook to whole party divested of beard have not be touched for many day dressed in more suitable apparel than usual hunting costume respect paid to sabbath by even most

generally prevailed although in few instance there be mockery from outside mr s gave blessing service be ended have already done much observed mr swinton must hardly have believed that concourse of savage must have be so attentive have behaved with such decorum certainly be most difficult point gained to command attention mean replied mr s after time patience with assistance of god will effect rest do think that there be many who if may use term feel religion yes many prove by traveling about sowing seed there be many who not only be qualified so to do be incessantly laboring to bring countryman to god must be very satisfactory to be what be few who labor with to thousand thousand who be here in darkness require aid there be now three mission in caffreland there be full employment

assaguays in hand be fine tall young men from twenty to thirty year of age alexander desired mr s to tell that if behaved well be faithful must one receive present when be dismissed notification appeared to give general satisfaction ox have already be yoked taking leave of worthy missionary traveler mounted horse resumed journey for whole day proceeded along bank of kae river ran course through alternate glen hill clothed with fine timber a be on eminence looking down upon river head caffre warrior who have with others hung up shield at side of wagon now walked by traveler with assaguay in hand pointed out to a sun be setting behind hill two three large black mass on further bank of river what be what doe say sea cow replied interpreter hippopotamus must have shot at cried major to be sure tell will stop kill one if can said wilmot to interpreter will want one to feed army said swinton laughing sheep will soon be devoured caffre be immediately in motion running down to bank of river about quarter of mile distant swam across there remained waiting till traveler must give word animal lay on muddy bank at turn of river like so many swine asleep of out partly in partly out of water a be huddled together looked more like mass of black rock than thing else two lay considerably apart from others be toward two that caffre who have crossed river crept until be in high reed few yard from henderson wilmot with of hottentot descended ravine on side of river opposite to where animal lay a soon a be on bank being then within one hundred yard of leveled fired at report animal started up from bed a if astonished at noise have not be accustomed to three four instantly plunged into deep water others apparently half asleep stood for few second a if not knowing what course to take two of be evidently wounded a rushed into water for did not remain below rose to surface immediately a if in great agony appeared anxious to get out of water altogether tried so to do fearing people on river bank darted in again in mean time at first report of gun two lay apart from others with head toward river a soon a rose on leg be pierced with several assaguays by concealed caffre plunged into water with spear remaining in body also rose floundered like others a head appeared above be met with unerring rifle of major whole volley from wilmot hottentot till exhausted from loss of blood floated dead upon surface caffre waited till body have be borne hundred yard down stream that might not be attacked when in water by remainder of herd then swam off pushed body on shore be very seasonable supply of provision for so large band of people who belonged to caravan be not only party who benefited caffre of surrounding hamlet hastened to river carried off large quantity of flesh of animal there be however more than enough for for wolf hyena after have taken what chose be so late before animal be cut up that decided upon remaining where be that night for now that have caffre warrior with have fear a to losing ox king having stated that men must be responsible for large fire be lighted caffre hottentot mingled together be busy roasting boiling frying flesh of hippopotamus eating a fast a be cooked so that be completely gorged before lay down to sleep wilmot have also given ration of tobacco have added considerably to delight of feast be not bad eating by mean said major a be at supper be something like old veal replied swinton now what be omrah about be after mischief by way creep along monkey be fool to boy observed major appears to know how to imitate animal have ever heard did hear dance led of hottentot on sunday evening when be at mission be that bremen told of thought must have died with laughing be aware that there be specie of bird here call honey bird by naturalist cuculus indicator do not remember showed specimen be preserving have showed so many specimen really forget well must have given at same time natural history of bird be very partial to honey upon life a much a can a bee make hive in trunk of old decayed tree hole enter by be very small bird can not obtain without assistance instinct induces to call in aid of man doe by peculiar note like cher cher cher by give notice that have found out beehive native of africa well know a soon a bird fly close to giving out sound follow bird lead on perching now then to enable to keep up with until arrives at tree over flutter without making more noise how very curious little bushman know a well a hottentot hearing that be going out in search of honey went before into wood concealing imitating note of bird so exactly that hottentot went on following for several mile wondering how be that bird must lead distance unwilling to give up pursuit about sunset have brought back to very edge of wood from whence have started when showed about one hundred yard ahead of dancing capering tumbling so like begum that thought be before not gained caravan again without knowing who played trick told swanevelt who speaks language swanevelt told bremen capital said major well be after trick now depend upon have great talent for drawing observed alexander very great one have given pencil occasionally piece of paper draw bird so can recognize must know that bushman have talent that cave be full of sketch of sort of animal remarkably characteristic organ of imitation be very strongly developed in bushman account for talent a draftsman be remarkable imitative power do then believe in phrenology swinton said alexander believe disbelieve in many more modern discovery of same kind think right to reject to give blind credence not day pass discovery excites wonder admiration point out to how little do know great fault be that when people have made discovery to certain extent build upon a if premise be correct whereas have in fact only obtained mere glimmering to light to path may future day lead to knowledge that general principle of phrenology be correct maybe fairly assumed from examination of skull of men animal of different men give credence to division subdivision have in opinion be most presumptuously marked out by who profess of course fully believe full extent of supposed discovery mesmerism said alexander make same reply there be something in be certain nothing yet sufficiently known to warrant specific conclusion to be drawn there be great deal of humbug in said major so there be in science when truth fails be at fault fill up hiatus with supposition be a term humbug well vote that return to wagon body appears fast asleep except three such be not however case for have not be hour on mattress before be awakened by loud cry of help made seize irguns jump out of wagon without waiting for clothes hottentot caffre be so full of hippopotamus flesh that noise did not awake small portion of only turned round stared about without getting up with exception of bremen who be on foot with gun in hand running in direction of cry be followed by traveler soon came up with object of search proved to be other than big adam hottentot a soon a perceived condition must do by light of fire still burning burst out laughing so excessively that must not help that be work of little omrah there be doubt for big adam have not forgotten former trick boy have played have more than once when caught boy given good cuffing big adam be on ground dragged away by two of largest dog omrah have taken bone must find with most flesh upon belonging to hippopotamus have tied with leathern thong to great toe of big adam a lay snoring after unusual repast have then waited till be asleep have let loose two largest dog be always tied with others under wagon not over fed to make more watchful dog have prowled about for food have fallen in with large bone immediately seized be dragging away that might make repast without interruption in attempting to drag away bone have dragged big adam yard by great toe pain fright for hottentot thought be hyena wolf have caused thus to scream for help bremen divided thong with knife dog ran off growling with bone adam stood again upon foot still so much terrified a not to be able to comprehend trick have be played traveler having indulged mirth retired once more to resting place major found omrah begum in corner of wagon former pretending to be fast asleep while latter be chattering swearing at unusual disturbance at daylight next morning resumed journey big adam walked rather stiff looked very sulky omrah have perched on tilt of baggage wagon with begum be quite out of hottentot reach for bremen have told others what have happened there have be general laugh against big adam who vowed vengeance against little omrah country be now very beautiful fertile caffre hamlet be to be seen in direction except visit from caffre who behaved with great decorum when perceived that caravan be escorted by king warrior who supplied nearly day with bullock for use of people adventure occurred for four day when crossed bashee st john river to territory of hinza extended although tribe beyond did not acknowledge authority respected large force of caravan be much pleased at receiving small present of tobacco snuff milk in basket be constantly brought in by woman for caffre weave basket of so close texture that hold liquid be only utensil used for purpose at bashee river after have passed ford remained one day to hunt hippopotamus be successful only major henderson who be not content to hunt during day went out at night have narrow escape be in one of path have wounded female be standing watching rising to surface of wounded animal for be bright moonlight when male happened to be feeding on bank above hearing cry of female rushed right down path upon major fortunately for huge carcass of animal gave such ungovernable degree of velocity a to prevent turning to right hand left passed within yard of major sweeping bush underwood so a to throw down a passed major got up again may be truly said more frightened than hurt at event have have enough of hippopotamus hunting for night for recovered gun walked back to wagon thanking heaven for providential escape next morning swanevelt bremen went down bank of river discovered body of hippopotamus dragged on shore returning to wagon sent caffre to cut up before caffre belonging to caravan must arrive there found that work have be done for by native that nothing be left bone of animal be always considered fair in caffre land one help when elephant other large animal be killed although may have have hand in destruction number of elephant path now showed that be surrounded by animal caffre of country said that there be large herd close to be therefore proposed by major that must have grand elephant hunt at caffre of own party native of country must assist proposal be joyfully received by especially native who be delighted at opportunity of having assistance of white men gun next day be appointed for sport by advice of native caravan proceeded mile down to eastward to border of very thick forest where stated that elephant be to be found arrived at spot in afternoon one be busy in making preparation for following day hottentot who have be used to sport told long story to who have not among rest big adam spoke much of prowess dexterity uncommonly large fire be lighted that night for fear that elephant must break into camp night cry be to be heard in forest occasionally breaking of branch of tree proved that be close to caravan begum who be particularly alive to danger crept to major henderson bed must remain there night although several time tried to drive away notwithstanding continued alarm caravan be however unmolested chapter xiii at following morning there be large concourse of caffre in camp waiting till traveler be ready for sport having made hasty breakfast by advice of caffre did not mount horse started on foot a caffre stated that elephant be on side of hill ascending by elephant path in le than hour arrived at top of hill when grand magnificent panorama be spread before from crown of hill looked down upon valley studded with clump of tree divided cleared ground whole face of valley be covered with elephant there must not have be le than nine hundred at one time within scope of vision height green knoll be dotted with group of six seven of vast body partly concealed by tree upon be browsing others walking in open plain bearing in trunk long branch of tree with evidently protected from fly huge body of animal with corresponding magnitude of large timber tree surrounded gave idea of nature on grandest scale after few minute survey turned to party who be collected behind gave notice that be to commence immediately head men of caffre gave order band of native moved silently away in direction checking noise from dog have brought with in numerous pack traveler be to leeward of herd on hill where stood a be intention of native to drive animal toward caffre warrior a well a hottentot took up position on hill ready to attack animal a be driven way about hour passed away when signal be given by of native caffre who have gained side of valley to westward of elephant perched up at various high spot shouted with stentorian lung shout be answered by rest of caffre on side of valley so that elephant found encompassed on side except on where hill rose from valley a caffre closed in shout reverberating from rock mixed up with savage howling of dog became tremendous elephant alarmed started first to one side of valley then to other hastily retreating from clamor immediately raised a approached shaking long ear trumpeting loudly a with uplifted trunk trotted to fro at last finding other avenue of escape herd commenced ascent of hill cracking branch bough rolling loose stone down into valley a made ascent now adding own horrid shriek to din have be previously created on came bearing thing down before carrying havoc in rage to extent that forest appeared to bow down before while large mass of loose rock leaped bounded thundered down into valley raising cloud of dust in passage be tremendously grand whispered alexander to major be most awfully so must not have missed sight for thing here come look at tall tree borne down by weight of whole mass see great bull leader said swinton let fire upon what monster look out said major whose rifle be discharged a spoke be quickly followed by of alexander swinton be down be quick load again omrah give other rifle take care take care be how cried on side for fall of leading elephant volley of musketry from hottentot have so frightened herd that have begun to separate break off two three together singly in direction shriek trumpetings crashing of bough so near to be now deafening danger be equally great major have just leveled other rifle when dense foliage close to opened a if by magic head of large female presented within four yard of fortunately major be man of great nerve rifle brought down at foot when so near to that be compelled to leap away out of reach of trunk for be not yet dead smaller elephant followed so close that tumbled over carcass of first be shot by alexander a be recovering leg back sir will be killed cried bremen running to way whole herd be coming right upon ran for life following hottentot who brought to high rock elephant must not climb where be safe have hardly gained when mass came forward in cloud of dust with noise almost inconceivable scrambling rolling to fro a passed on in close wedged body many be wounded tottering a be left behind caffre naked with assaguays in hand leaping forward hiding a required running with greatest activity close up to rear of animal pierced with assaguays hamstrung with sharp cutting weapon cry out in own tongue to elephant great captain kill tread upon mighty chief supplicating strangely enough mercy of to whom be showing none a be almost impossible to fire without chance of hitting caffre traveler contented with looking on till whole herd have passed by have disappeared in jungle below have gone right in direction of wagon said swinton yes sir replied hottentot bremen must not interfere with more be now so scattered in jungle that must be dangerous must let go away a fast a can remained for few minute more till elephant caffre have disappeared then went back cautiously to spot from whence have first fired where have fine prospect of valley not elephant be to be seen in nothing ravage herd have committed upon tree many of of very large size have be borne to ground by enormous strength of animal then proceeded to spot where great bull elephant have fallen by rifle of major henderson found that ball have entered just under eye be monster must have stood sixteen foot high by bremen calculation have two very fine tusk while be standing by carcass of animal armed hottentot returned from pursuit stated that seven elephant have be dispatched others be so wounded that must not live now set to work to take teeth out of animal be very busy when hottentot came running up reported that herd of elephant in retreat have dashed through camp done good deal of mischief that male elephant have charged wagon of major henderson have forced tusk through side that tusk have pierced one of cask of liquor be running out although not very fast that wagon must be unloaded to get out cask save rest of liquor several hottentot immediately hurried back with to help in unloading wagon by degree slipped away except bremen swanevelt who be cutting out tusk omrah who remained perched upon huge carcass of animal imitating trumpeting motion of elephant playing sort of antic party of caffre soon afterward came up commenced cutting up carcass then traveler walked away in direction of camp to ascertain what mischief have be done on return a stopped occasionally to examine other animal have fallen must have taken hour found that hottentot have not commenced unloading wagon although have put tub to catch running liquor of have taken so large quantity that be staggering about rest lying down in state of senseless intoxication thought be very officious in going back to assist observed major pretty mess must be in if be in enemy country without caffre guard yes indeed replied alexander turning over tub of liquor spilling on ground much to sorrow of hottentot who be not yet insensible however will now let cask run out watch that get more a caffre be busy with carcass of elephant most of hottentot dead drunk be useless to think of proceeding until following day indeed ox horse be scattered in direction by elephant breaking into caravan must be necessary to collect must require time traveler therefore gave up idea of proceeding further that day taking gun walked on to forest in direction where most of elephant killed have fallen passed by three carcass upon caffre be busily employed then came to fourth when sight presented quite moved sympathy be carcass of full grown female close to be elephant calf about three foot half high standing by side of dead mother poor little animal ran round round body with demonstration of grief piping sorrowfully trying in vain to raise up with tiny trunk when traveler arrived ran up to entwining little proboscis round leg showing delight at finding somebody on tree round carcass be perched number of vulture waiting to make meal of remains a soon a hunter have cut up for beak must not penetrate tough hide traveler remained there for more than hour watching motion playing with young elephant made several attempt to induce prostrate mother to take notice of finding however that effort be ineffectual when traveler quitted spot to go back voluntarily followed to caravan where remained probably quite a much astonished to find hottentot lying about a insensible a mother may be a well here to observe that little animal did not live beyond very few day after from want of necessary food in evening bremen swanevelt returned with tusk of bull elephant be very large caffre warrior also came in other caffre belonging to country be too busy eating for present chief of caffre warrior brought in tuft of other elephant tail teeth men be loaded with flesh a soon a caffre found that ox horse have be frightened away perceived that hottentot be not in situation to go after threw down meat went in pursuit before dark cattle be brought back fire be lighted caffre did not give over repast until near midnight traveler did not think advisable a hottentot be now protection to go to bed made up large fire remained by talking over adventure of day while be conversing begum who have be sitting by master showed sign of uneasiness at last clung round major with evident strong fear why what can be matter with princess said major something have frightened yes be evident perhaps there be elephant near will waken bremen swanevelt who be close to begum chattered teeth also chattered with fear a clung closer closer little omrah who be sitting by looked very earnestly at baboon at last touching shoulder of alexander to attract attention first pointed to baboon imitating fright then going on hand foot imitated motion growl of animal understand cried major seizing gun lad mean that there be lion near be what frightens baboon lion said major to omrah omrah did not understand pulling out paper pencil in second almost drew form of lion clever little fellow wake get gun ready said major starting on leg ca be far off confound monkey wo let go continued tearing off begum throwing away begum immediately scampered to wagon hid have just awakened up two hottentot when roar be given so loud tremendous that appeared like thunder be reverberated from rock opposite for second one who have be in country have fallen in with animal in wild savage state can have idea of appalling effect of lion roar what be heard in menagerie be weak can give faint conception of in darkness of night be almost impossible to tell from what quarter sound proceeds arises from habit animal have of placing mouth close to ground when roar so that voice roll over earth a be like breaker sound be carried along with tremendous force be indeed most awful note of preparation so thought alexander who have never heard one before caffre have wakened up at noise traveler hottentot now fired gun off in direction to scare away animal repeated discharge have effect in course of hour thing be again quiet well observed alexander be first time that ever heard roar of lion in wild state can assure that will never forget a long a live be not first time have heard replied major must say what with darkness stillness of night reverberation never heard so awful before swinton who have traveled in namaqua land have of course yes have very seldom be rather singular that have not heard lion before be not said alexander lion be often near without giving notice replied swinton think that there be many lion in country have traversed be too populous on other side of mountain if return way will find in plenty wherever antelope be in herd wherever find wild horse zebra giraffe will a certainly find lion for prey upon know very well swinton that be closely attentive to peculiar habit of animal that form portion of study have much knowledge of lion if so suppose tell something about have certainly studied habit of lion have gathered from own observation information received from others will be most happy to communicate lion undoubtedly doe not kill wantonly of have have repeated instance recollect one be rather remarkable a showed sagacity of noble brute man who belonged to one of mission station on return home from visit to friend took circuitous route to pas pool of water at hoped to kill antelope sun have risen to height when arrived there a must not perceive game laid gun down on low shelving rock back part of be covered with brushwood went down to pool have hearty drink returned to rock after smoking pipe feeling weary lay down fell fast asleep in short time excessive heat reflected from rock awoke opening eye perceived large lion about yard from foot crouched down with eye glaring on face for minute remained motionless with fright expecting moment that must be in jaw of monster at last recovered presence of mind casting eye toward gun moved hand slowly toward upon lion raised up head gave tremendous roar induced hastily to withdraw hand with lion appeared satisfied crouched with head between fore paw a before after little while man made attempt to posse of gun lion raised head gave roar man desisted attempt be at interval made always with same anger shown on part of lion why lion must have known what wanted gun for most certainly did therefore must not allow man to touch be to be presumed that sagacious creature have be fired at before observe that did not wish to harm man appeared to say be in power will not go away will not take musket to shoot with will tear to piece certainly be very curious pray how did end why heat of sun on rock be so overpowering that man be in great agony naked foot be so burned that be compelled to keep moving placing one upon other changing minute day passed night also lion never moved from spot sun rose again heat became so intense that poor man foot be past feeling at noon on day lion rose walked to pool be only few yard distant looking behind moment to see if man moved man once more attempted to reach gun lion perceiving turned in rage be on point of springing upon man withdrew hand beast be pacified how very strange animal went to water drank then returned lay down at same place a before about yard from man foot night passed away lion kept at post next day in forenoon animal again went to water while there looked a if heard noise in opposite quarter then disappeared in bush perceiving man made effort seized gun in attempting to rise found not in power a strength of ankle be gone with gun in hand crept to pool drank looking at foot discovered that toe have be quite roasted skin torn off a crawled through grass sat at pool for few minute expecting lion return resolved to send content of gun through head lion did not return so poor fellow tied gun on back crawled away on hand knee a well a must be quite exhausted must have proceeded further when providentially person fell in with assisted home lost toe be cripple for life what make story more remarkable be observed major that lion a be rational to suppose must have be hungry after watching man for sixty hour even admitting that have taken meal short time before know many other curious well authenticated anecdote about noble animal observed swinton will be happy to give must look at memorandum book may not be quite correct in story one fact be very remarkable a have from mr missionary who stated that have several time observed have hesitation in vouching for correctness more so a did once perceive similar fact be that fifth commandment be observed by lion honor father mother if old lion be in company with child a native call although be in size equal to if number of lion meet together in quest of game there be always one who be admitted by to be oldest ablest who lead if game be come up with be one who creep up to seizes while others lie crouched upon grass if old lion be successful generally be retires from victim lie down to breathe rest for perhaps quarter of hour others in meantime draw round lie down at respectful distance never presume to go near animal old lion have killed a soon a old lion considers sufficiently rested go up to prey commences at breast stomach after eating considerable portion will take second rest none of others presuming to move having made second repast then retires other lion watch motion rush to remainder of carcass be soon devoured said that witnessed instance in corroboration of statement will now mention be sitting on rock after collecting plant when below saw young lion seize antelope have paw upon dead animal when old lion came up upon young one immediately retired till superior have dined first then came in for remainder mercy on what be thought be lion again said alexander be thunder be about to have storm yes fierce one too said major be afraid that must break up party retire under cover have large drop of rain already flash of lightning now dazzled be followed by instantaneous peal of thunder there be mistake in said swinton can tell that will have upon in le than minute so be for wagon at event will wash hottentot sober observed major a walked away to separate wagon for shelter chapter xiv have scarcely gained wagon before thunder lightning became incessant so loud a to be deafening appeared a if be in very center of contending element wind rose blew with terrific force while rain poured down a if flood gate of heaven be indeed opened lightning be so vivid that for second that lasted must see country round to horizon almost a clear a day next moment be terrific gloom accompanied by stunning report of thunder caused article in wagon wagon to vibrate from concussion large tree not fifty yard from caravan be struck by lightning came down with appalling crash caffre have roused up have sheltered under wagon hottentot have also begun to move have not yet recovered sens indeed be again stupefied by clamor of element storm lasted about hour then a suddenly cleared up again star again made appearance in sky above red tinge of horizon announced approach of daylight when storm ceased traveler who have not taken off clothes came out from shelter met other by side of extinguished fire well said alexander have be made wise on two point night now know what african storm be also roar of african lion have heard if there be mischief done bremen continued alexander to hottentot who stood by sir be afraid will take long while to collect cattle will be dispersed in direction may have lost of will soon be daylight then must set off after be fellow quite sober now yes sir replied bremen laughing water have washed liquor out of well may tell a punishment will stop tobacco for week better not now sir said bremen thoughtfully men like to go further up country may be troublesome think so too said swinton must recollect that cask be running out temptation be too strong must overlook time give severe reprimand let off believe will be best way replied alexander not that fear refusing to go on for if do will dismiss go on with caffre dare not go back by be certain sir said bremen be very true must not trust caffre too much

in receiving instruction amusement from well swinton have extorted compliment from major yes extra allowance of steak be better thing replied swinton laughing now have finished breakfast will tell what know about be people bushman be originally hottentot race of think there be little doubt believe be race of people produced by circumstance if may use expression hottentot on plain life nomad life pasturing living upon herd bushman may be considered a hottentot driven out of fertile plain deprived of cattle compelled to resort to hill for safety subsistence in short hill hottentot impelled by hunger by injury have committed depredation upon property of others until have have mark set upon hand have be against man have be hunted like wild beast compelled to hide in cave of almost inaccessible rock hill thus generation after generation have suffered privation hunger till race have dwindled down to small size be at present unable to contend against force only weapon have be cunning poisoned arrow with have obtained livelihood rather may be said have contrived to support life more there be however many race mixed up with bushman for runaway slave brought from madagascar malay even of mixed white breed when have committed murder other penal crime have added to race incorporated with be called child of desert be literally such have seen much of yes when be in namaqua land in bechuana territory saw great deal of think that be insensible to kindness moreover believe that may often be trusted run great risk have ever shown gratitude yes when have killed game for have followed on purpose to show pool of water without must have suffered severely if have not perished be talking about lion be old received opinion that jackal be lion provider must be more correct one to say that lion be bushman provider indeed once asked bushman do live ' reply be live by lion asked to explain to said ' will show what do let lion follow game kill eat till have belly full then go up to where lion be sitting down by carcass go pretty near to cry out what have got there can not spare of go away let have meat will do harm then dance jump about shake skin dress lion look at turn round walk away growl very much stay then eat rest be true yes believe a have have confessed by many others fact be lion be only dangerous when be hungry be if be not attacked if a bushman said lion have eaten sufficiently probably not wishing to be disturbed after repast by presence shout of bushman animal retires to other spot be informed that very short time afterward bushman who told what have detailed to be killed by lioness when attempting to drive away from prey by shouting a be used to do fact be that perceived lioness devouring wild horse went up to a usual did not observe that have whelp with shouted growled savagely before have time to retreat sprang upon tore to piece lion doe not prey upon men then although destroys not generally namaqua people told that if lion once take fancy to men flesh do after have in hunger devoured one two become doubly dangerous a will leave other game hunt man only can not vouch for being truth although be very probable if judge from analogy be replied major bengal tiger in india be well known if once taste human flesh prefer to other be well known to native who term man eater strange to say appears that human flesh be not wholesome for for skin become mangy after have taken to eating that alone have shot bean eater ' from back of elephant found that skin be not worth taking namaquas replied swinton told that lion once enamored of human flesh must in order to obtain so far overcome caution that must leap through fire to seize man once went to visit namaqua chief who have be severely wounded by lion of description man eater a major term gave following dreadful narrative certainly corroborates what assert of lion who have once taken fancy to human flesh chief told that have gone out with party of men to hunt have gun bow arrow assaguays on first day a be pursuing elephant came across lion who attacked be obliged to save life by abandoning horse lion devoured then made hiding place of thick bush by pool

after destruction of four men in four day hunting be given over body of chief brother be buried party went home bearing with wounded chief well be most horrible lion adventure have yet heard said major heaven preserve from man eating lion really have almost taken away breath said alexander well then will tell one more amusing not so fatal in result be told by bushman said bushman be following herd of zebra have just succeeded in wounding one with arrow when discovered that have be interfering with lion who be also in chase of same animal a lion appeared very angry at interference with right a lord of manor evidently inclined to punish bushman a poacher upon preserve latter perceiving tree convenient climbed up into a fast a must lion allowed herd of zebra to go away turned attention to bushman walked round round tree now then growled a looked up at bushman at last lion lay down at foot of tree there kept watch night bushman kept watch also toward morning feeling very tired be overcome by sleep a slept dreamed what do think that dreamed dreamed that fell from tree into jaw of lion starting up in horror from effect of dream lost hold falling from branch down came with weight right on back of lion lion so unexpectedly saluted sprang up with loud roar tossing off bushman running away a fast a must bushman recovering leg sens also took to heel in different direction thus be beleepers awakened dream became true besieger retreating fort evacuated at same time cried major laughing well think have have enough of lion now said swinton have quite enough of

always follow major if be not tied up strolled away from camp to amuse at first walked to hill from have splendid view of valley covered with elephant proceeding to where male elephant have fallen found that flesh have by caffre wolf vulture be completely taken off bone lay there beautiful skeleton for museum a however have room for such weighty article in wagon left after swinton have made observation upon structure of animal begum must not go near skeleton appeared to be frightened at then proceeded to rock have be place of refuge when herd of elephant have charged upon a stood under be suddenly saluted with loud noise over head sounding like quah quah a soon a begum heard ran up to major with sign of trepidation holding fast to skin trowsers what be said alexander see nothing know what be said major be herd of baboon there be see head over rock let show little more will have shot at replied alexander cocking gun not for life cried swinton will be skinned torn to piece if be numerous enrage have idea what savage powerful creature be look at now be coming down gradually have better be off think so too said major be very angry have seen begum imagine that have one of herd in possession pray fire wilmot unless be for life be too few to make afraid of here come there be hundred of at least let walk away slowly wo do to run for must make chase at once baboon of be of gigantic size be now descending from rock grunting grinning springing from stone to stone protruding mouth shaking head drawing back skin of forehead showing formidable tusk advancing nearer nearer threatening attack of largest male advanced so close a to make snatch at omrah a for begum kept behind major hiding a much a possible at last one two advanced so close rising on hind leg that major be obliged to ward off with gun point gun at said swinton if come too close fire beg if only get from off rocky ground to plain below will probably get rid of ground on be formed portion of rocky hill upon have taken shelter day of elephant hunt within twenty five yard of there be abrupt descent of about four foot joined to plain have gained half way parrying animal off a well a must a retreated backward when of baboon came down from other side of rock so a to attempt to cut off retreat object evidently being to gain possession of begum whom considered a belonging to captive situation now became more critical for whole herd be joining foremost noise made anger expressed be much greater than before must fire really believe said major when heard deep hollow growl followed up by roar of animal apparently not very far off at sound baboon halted listened in silence again growl be repeated followed up by roar baboon at shriek given by one on rock turned round took to heel much to delight of traveler who have felt peculiar difficulty danger of situation what animal be that have frightened off said major be growl of leopard replied swinton must keep sharp look out ca be far off leopard be great enemy of baboon where be omrah looked round boy be not to be seen at last showed head above foot of rocky hill where there be descent of four foot a have mentioned then sprang up rock began capering imitating baboon a came on to attack a be laughing at at once stopped putting hand to mouth gave growl roar of leopard have heard then set off running away baboon fashion be bushman then frightened off be clever little fellow be not sure that have not saved life replied swinton have be brought up among one may say know habit well if have not hid below rock before imitated leopard must have be of use for must not have be frightened hearing growl proceeding from admire boy presence of mind thought at one time that baboon have idea that omrah be one of what snatch made at must not have be first time that animal have carried off boy said swinton saw one at latakoo who have lived two year with baboon have carried off how did treat very well indeed kept prisoner when found that must not eat coarse food did brought other thing invariably allowed to drink first at pool well be homage to superiority confound quahs will not get out of head for week what terrible large tusk have yes incisor be very strong often destroy leopard when meet in number if one happens to be away from herd have of course chance with animal begum did not appear at willing to renew connection none of monkey tribe after have lived with man ever be indeed be question if have taken possession of whether must not have torn to piece immediately have worried to death way other well at event swinton have be rewarded for kindness to poor little bushman have reaped benefit of observed alexander here come of ox hope will be able to start early on monday native caffre say that wagon can not proceed much further no not further than to bank of umtata river will then be not great way from destination daaka be chief name be not yes be name if be a supposed to be be first cousin how strange sound to a look around in savage wild country must be within forty mile of blood relation who be inhabitant of well will soon know truth must say if be only to end in morning call have come long way for purpose replied major have come to ascertain fact from what now know of country inhabitant will be source of thing pleasure if be established only hope be that may prove otherwise than suppose there be little chance of fear at event come what may observed swinton will have done duty on return found men cattle collected night increased number of fire tied ox to wagon that might not be scattered by return of lion latter did not however make appearance night be passed without disturbance following day being sunday hottentot be assembled desired not to start from camp a must be expected to attend

caffre head man of warrior asked interpreter to inquire of traveler why struck bell be to let god know that be about to pray did hear what said swinton replied that god heard that said listened to prayer of who trusted in great many other question be put by caffre of be replied to with great caution by mr swinton a be fearful that might not otherwise be understood by caffre be a be proved by question followed in consequence great portion of afternoon be passed away in explaining replying to interrogatory of people traveler felt convinced that by having kept sabbath in savage land have done good by example for a swinton truly observed missionary come into land to spread gospel of christ tell native that such be religion belief of white men that such be doctrine be inculcated now white men come here a trader be occasionally seen here a traveler if native find a have found that white men stated by missionary to hold same belief not only show evidence of belief be guilty of sin expressly forbidden by religion preached be not work of missionary nearly destroyed have often thought that behavior of dutch boor toward native must have have such effect indeed may say that colony have be founded upon very opposite principle to of 'doing unto others a must must do unto ' believe that there never yet be intercourse between christian nominal savage in portion of globe that savage have with great justice thrown in christian teeth that preached one thing did unfortunately taunt be too true even who have left country for religious persecution have erred in same way conduct of puritan who landed at salem be a barbarous toward indian a of pizarro follower toward mexican in case poor aborigine be hunted to death on monday started at daylight proceeded on journey made little progress on account of difficulty of traveling with wagon in country consisting of alternate precipice ravine without road second day proved to be one of greater difficulty be obliged to cut down tree fill up hole remove large piece of rock with precaution wagon be often out of order be obliged to halt for repair at night be about ten mile from umtata river be doubtful from account received from native of country if must be able to go further with wagon than to bank in evening news be brought that amaquibi nation of warrior be governed by quetoo have come from north have be attacked by two of native tribe aided by white men with gun that white men have be destroyed that hostile army be marching south native caffre appeared to be in panic panic be soon communicated to hottentot at first murmuring be heard a sat round fire at last broke out into open mutiny big adam with three others came up to fire where traveler be sitting intimated that must return immediately a must proceed further that if be decided to go on hottentot must not a have intention of being murdered by savage who be advancing swinton who must speak dutch language having consulted with alexander major replied that be very true that army of quetoo be to northward that report of defeat of caffre of army advancing be not confirmed be only rumor might all be false that even if true did not follow be advancing in direction in be about to proceed that must be sufficient time for to retreat when found out what be real fact must be case in few day at furthest hottentot must not listen to thing that said declared that must proceed further by time other hottentot have joined first who came up to traveler made same demand stating determination not to proceed mile further only bremen swanevelt opposed rest declared that must follow master wherever chose to lead alexander now sent for interpreter chief of caffre warrior lent by hinza desired interpreter to ask caffre whether band must follow caffre answered that must hinza have given in charge must not return say that have left because there be enemy at hand hinza must kill if did must bring back traveler safe lose life in defense well then said major now can do without cowardly fellow who be use to to eat drink so now let discharge at once bremen swanevelt agree with major said alexander what do think swinton yes let discharge for then will be in precious dilemma will discharge without arm desire to go home that dare not do so will remain let first secure musket lie round fire before dismiss will not perhaps surrender may be in awkward position will slip away while be away do keep in talk until return will not do until have locked up gun in store wagon a swinton rose major addressed hottentot now lad said here be bremen swanevelt who consent to follow caffre warrior agree to follow here be about twenty of who refuse now can not think that will leave know that have treated well have given plenty of tobacco know that will be punished a soon a return to cape why then be so foolish now look be sure that upon reflection will think better of let understand clearly reason for not proceeding with wish to hear again let man speak for hottentot immediately began to state over again reason for not going on thus major who made give reason separately gained attention time be required before have spoken swinton came back took seat by fire safe said bremen swanevelt gun have be locked up with others traveler have own lying by caffre warrior who be standing behind hottentot have assaguays in hand shield a usual be hanging to side of wagon major allowed whole of hottentot to speak when be done said now wilmot turn table on alexander then got up with gun in hand major swinton did same then alexander told hottentot that be cowardly set of fellow that with bremen swanevelt band of caffre warrior must do without since did not choose to proceed might now leave camp immediately a must get food thing else from in future so now be off whole of if find one to morrow morning in sight of camp if one of dare to follow will order caffre to run through be dismissed to morrow leave without alexander then called chief of caffre warrior desired in presence of hottentot to give particular charge of cattle horse sheep to warrior during night if one attempted to touch to run through body do immediately said alexander to chief who without delay spoke to men went off in obedience to order hottentot who have heard now retreated to wagon be struck with consternation when found that gun have be removed for trusted to gun ammunition to enable to procure food protect on return consulted together in low voice looked round perceived that three traveler have quitted fire be keeping guard with gun upon wagon to prevent attempt of breaking open on part of hottentot moreover ten of caffre with spear have since breaking up of conference be put in charge of wagon by chief at request of major hottentot now perceived forlorn position how must without arm ammunition without provision return to cape number of mile distant how must exist if remained where be when insisted upon traveler returning have quite overlooked circumstance that must protect with caffre warrior that be not in condition to enforce demand after long conversation did what hottentot will do under emergency lay down by fire fell fast asleep swinton having ascertained that be really asleep proposed that must retire to wagon leave caffre on guard did a well knew that hottentot once fast asleep be not easily roused up even to treason stratagem spoil shortly after break of day bremen came to stating that found wagon must proceed no further a have walked on discovered that mile before there be ravine so deep that must be difficult for cattle to go down for wagon impossible that at distance of three mile below must see river be also so embedded in rock a to be impassable by wagon major immediately went with bremen to satisfy of truth of returned stating that further progress with wagon be impossible well then must now hold council said swinton of course proceed will wilmot be decided only question be a must now proceed on horseback what force will take with what will be left in charge of wagon think can trust caffre yes do wish from heart that hottentot have not rebelled for although in respect cowardly fellow yet with musket be brave musket keep native in order to caffre content of wagon must prove temptation be not temptation to hottentot whose object be to get back safe receive wage thus play off against other here be hottentot coming up to said major hope be to make submission be very desirable that must do so before know that wagon proceed further surmise of major be correct hottentot have again canvassed matter over perceiving helplessness of position have come in body to beg forgiveness to offer to accompany traveler wherever pleased to take be long while before alexander must consent to receive again not until have made promise upon promise that seemed at last to be mollified swinton then interceded for at last alexander consented upon future good behavior to overlook conduct matter having be satisfactorily arranged former question be resumed one of fear must remain with wagon observed alexander of if please have right to ask to go upon wild goose chase run into danger for nothing that one must remain with wagon will be necessary said swinton think that major if doe not object be proper person party who be left must provide with food by gun will require more military tact than posse to arrange to defend wagon will accompany wilmot a can speak better dutch interpreter will not get on well without will have kindness to take charge of wagon major during absence think perhaps will be a well although have rather have gone with replied major propose that take thirty of caffre bremen eight hottentot with leave swanevelt other hottentot yes will do very well will leave caffre head man with must go with larger portion of party must not well be separated from will find proper place for wagon stockade regularly in will be good job for hottentot dare say will do very well will not leave omrah major said swinton for a will take four horse with wish to ride one can attend upon a have mahomed may have begum to ride other replied major if please then will have groom must be pity to part however there be time to be lost for if great chief warrior quetoo be advancing may be a well to be ready for retreat sooner be off sooner will be back so now to pack up chapter xvi first step taken by alexander be to send for hottentot after again reproving for former behavior asked who be ready to volunteer to proceed with a have decided to leave wagon with major henderson proceed on horseback short distance of journey remained to be accomplished several of hottentot immediately came forward head of mutiny held back thus proved to alexander that men who have come forward be persuaded into by others regretted what have done therefore immediately accepted service musket be returned to alexander then stated intention to caffre head man who selected thirty warrior be required in course of three hour thing be ready for departure be arranged that in case of danger arising to party must if possible fall back to newly established mission of morley on sea coast otherwise wagon must remain where be till alexander return having packed up required in small package to be carried by caffre bade farewell to major set off having baggage what have mentioned for alexander must not be encumbered with load of heavy article must prevent rapid progress rapid retreat if necessary in two hour arrived by difficult pass at bank of umtata river crossed soon afterward falling in with caffre kraal be informed that daaka chief whom sought did not reside more than twenty mile distant easily procured guide to show way report of advance of amaquibi army be here fully confirmed native be preparing to leave kraal with cattle appeared however that at present army be stationary warrior carousing enjoying after victory have gained over caffre a have be assisted by white men gun spirit of amaquibi be raised to extraordinary degree be intending to carry arm to southward a soon a quetoo chief have somewhat recovered from wound received in late action indeed be wounded state of chief be principal cause of army not having immediately proceeded to southward having obtained information traveler resumed journey along bank of umtata over country of surprising beauty deep river being full of hippopotamus be lying on bank snorting in stream must not wait to kill one during daytime promised men must allow to make attempt in evening after day march be over toward sunset stopped on bank of river on rising ground hottentot caffre be then directed to go down to river in chase of hippopotamus a be advisable to save provision a much a possible before night

head warrior came up to interpreter told alexander swinton not to say that be warrior if asked where came from on being asked why told that hinza have married daughter of chief of country after time have sent back again to father that have created ill blood between tribe although war have taken place alexander swinton who perceived that advice be judicious told that must not after partaking of hippopotamus flesh lay down to repose under far spreading branch of large tree next morning set off after hour journey guide told that be at kraal of daaka descendant of european bellowing of cattle noise of calf soon directed to spot entered kraal consisting of several very wretched hut on inquiring for daaka woman pointed out hut at little distance a dismounted walked up came out to meet swinton alexander shook hand with chief said that be very glad to see that have come far to pay visit chief ordered hut to be swept out for accommodation took possession of have idea swinton said alexander how much be excited already by interview can imagine dear wilmot said swinton be natural for be kinsman by report certainly although caffre in habit manner countenance feature be strikingly european have observed have fully convinced of truth of statement be most anxious to examine must call interpreter chief entered hut soon afterward took seat interpreter be sent for conversation be begun by daaka who like most of caffre chief with hope of obtaining present stated to be very poor cattle to be dying child without milk traveler allowed to go on for time in manner then sent for present of bead tobacco gave then commenced inquiry first question asked be why resided so near sea because sea be mother replied came from sea sea feed when be hungry in reply evidently refers to

about know nothing about to collect must be impossible if collected equally impossible to remove for must not leave old relative fancy in mind eye daughter weeping over captivity longing to be restored to country relation still retaining european feeling sympathy miserable in position child brought up by with same idea day looking forward to emancipation from savage state of existence think if be here saw old daaka must soon divest of romantic idea think so too there be one thing have struck very forcibly alexander be if daaka be son of aunt how come that be so old when be grosvenor lost in year be now in aunt stated to have be ten twelve year old at time of wreck allowing to marry at earliest age daaka must not well be more than forty eight year old surely be more than that look much older certainly who can tell age of savage who have be living life of constant privation who have be so often wounded a scar show that have be wound hardship will soon make man look old be very true still appears to to be older than date warrant think stating that sister be named be be full corroboration be rather circumstantial evidence wilmot now what do propose to do hardly know wish to be in

unfortunate vessel know for asked for to read what succession of scene of horror do remains from solid weight only have defied power of wind wave conjure up at moment in mind think now behold brave vessel dashed upon reef scream of despair from on board heart rending situation of woman child wonderful escape landing on shore only to be subjected to greater suffering see swinton must have be rock gained upon remained shivering through night be have doubt from position said swinton yes must have be think see men woman helpless child huddled together half clothed suffering quitting that rock by only path from setting off upon mad perilous journey scattering of party peril hunger conflict with native suffering from heat from thirst sinking down one by one into welcome arm of death torn to piece by wolf hyena a lagged behind others how much more fortunate who never gained shore yes indeed replied swinton except eight who reached cape five daaka asserts be saved rest must have perished in dreadful manner alexander remained for time in painful thought at last turned to daaka said a pointed to remains of wreck then be mother daaka looked at shook head no not mother replied down there pointing out in northerly direction what doe mean swinton say be not mother will speak to wilmot be too much agitated replied swinton be not that vessel mother be lost in said swinton through interpreter replied daaka mother came on shore in vessel up little river out there be boy when large ship be wrecked got iron from to make assaguays merciful heaven what joy feel trust be true what

removed from mind how light hearted feel notwithstanding recital of suffering poor uncle god grant that may live till return with distinct intelligence with assurance that have grandchild living life of heathen knowing god what relief will prove to how soothing will be to last day how grateful be to god have have so happy issue to mission now swinton will return a soon a please a soon a arrive at

will be dry season may be in want of water occasionally be equally desirous of going through country where hope to shoot giraffe be great ambition replied wilmot therefore may consider that be agreed affair be settled question be how will proceed back must return to hinza territory send back caffre will return to butterworth think must depend upon circumstance can talk over a go along first point to ascertain be best passage over mountain appears to that will be diverging much too far to eastward if return to butterworth caffre will soon give necessary information wonder if quarrel between hinza voosani have be made up said alexander for must pas through tambookie tribe if cross mountain if there be war between may meet with difficulty will hear a soon a have crossed bashee river replied swinton then must decide accordingly can be settled now be that to morrow start on return that will cross mountain if possibly can yes be decided replied alexander well then a soon a have finished elephant steak wilmot will get out bottle of wine drink first half of to congratulate upon success of mission other half will be poured out in bumper to happy return chapter xvii return delight of hottentot at announcement of return of expedition be not to be concealed now that knew that be retreating from danger a be further removed became proportionately brave must not include hottentot in observation a bremen swanevelt one two more be really brave men do refer to principal portion of with big adam at head who now flourished vapored about a if must by kill eat whole army of dreaded quetoo a be intention of traveler to pas over mambookei chain of mountain into bushman koranna territory did not return same route by came more to westward through territory of tambookie caffre not one time entering upon territory of amakosas tribe of caffre governed by hinza who have lent warrior voosani chief of tambookies be very friendly have offered opposition to passage through portion of domain on advance now lost time continued journey a fast a must although during day saw great quantity of game be almost night saluted with roaring of lion in week found on bank of white kae river not far from foot of mountain intended to pas here halted with intention of remaining few day that might unload re arrange packing of wagon repair what be necessary provide with more ox sheep for journey in sterile territory of bushman during route rumor relative to army of quetoo be incessant have attacked murdered lieut farewell people who be on trading expedition in interior taken possession of plundered wagon flushed with success over white people armed with musket quetoo have now resolved to turn army to southward attack tribe of amaponda caffre governed by fakoo missionary

cattle burned kraal army advanced to missionary station missionary be compelled to desert fall back upon st john river one of men belonging to tribe near morley came to caravan where traveler have halted on being questioned a to loss have experienced cried out ask not how many be killed how many be saved wife where be child do see of fakoo chief of amapondas have roused collected army resolved upon giving battle to enemy found amaquibi encamped in forest surrounded with superior army then contrived by attacking retreating to lead into position from there be escape by pas by have entered completely blocked up with own force amaquibi must not retreat furious conflict took place ended in destruction of whole of quetoo army quetoo be not present a still remained confined with wound have received in prior engagement in have be victorious portion of fakoo army be sent against fled with loss of cattle treasure have collected thus be invading force at last totally dispersed not heard of more news be very satisfactory to traveler a did not know whether must have have time to make arrangement if quetoo army have be victorious be still more pleasing to hottentot who be now even braver than before lamenting that have not remained on bank of umtata river where combat took place that might have assisted at destruction of invader be toward end of august before traveler have made preparation be ready for start have decided to try pas through mambookei chain of mountain to eastward of one named stormbergen a expected to meet with difficulty be decided that caffre warrior must not be dismissed till have arrived at bushman territory proposed then to turn to nw so a to fall in with portion of orange river be known by name of vaal yellow river crossing black cradock river be also branch of orange river arrangement be made that might get into country more abounding with game better furnished with water than other portion of sterile desert have to pas through having a usual kept lord day on monday morning started in high spirit with cattle in excellent order passage through ravine be very difficult have to fill up hole roll away stone very often put double team to drag wagon made ten mile on first day found night cold after heat to have be subjected second day be also one of toil danger on third found that have commenced descent whole bushman country be spread before descent be even more perilous than ascent be not without great exertion that saved wagon from falling over precipice on fourth evening have crossed mountain be now at foot of on western side be with difficulty that collected wood enough to make fire for night continual roaring told that be now in domain of lion satellite at break of day rose that might view country be about to traverse be one wild desert of sand stone interspersed with small shrub here there patch of bush apparently one vast dry arid plain with haze over arising from heat traveler however did not at first notice change eye be fixed upon group of quagga various antelope be strewed over whole face of country a soon a have taken breakfast mounted horse in pursuit have be intention to have dismissed caffre on morning chief of band pointed out that must be a well that must kill game to provide with food for journey back traveler approved of suggestion a must save sheep alexander major set off with bremen swanevelt omrah on horseback while caffre on foot kept well up with other hottentot be ordered to remain with swinton at encampment a have to repair damage done to wagon in crossing mountain omrah have shown so useful that have be permitted to practice with fowling piece carrying ball have proved very expert now be mounted on major spare horse that in case major be knocked up might change for omrah weight be mere nothing plan of chase be that caffre must spread in half circle conceal a much a possible while on horseback must turn animal drive in direction a advanced on plain discovered what haze have prevented seeing at early dawn that plain be covered with variety of beautiful flower of amaryllis other tribe with hill of ant ant eater hole latter be very dangerous to horse sun be now up in heaven blazed fiercely heat be intense although still early in day when turned head toward mountain have passed be struck with astonishment at grandeur of scene rock cliff in wild chaos barren ridge towering peak worn by time into castellated fortress other strange shape calling to fancy ruin of former world with exception of pool of water near to caravan have halted not vestige of element be to be seen in direction be one plain ending only in horizon without tree line only broken by group of animal long neck of pack of ostrich in distance if however vegetable kingdom be deficient animal be proportionably abundant alexander major be soon at speed after troop of quagga zebra succeeded in turning toward caffre a soon a animal have entered radius of half circle be within distance checked horse opened fire upon at same time caffre showed animal be for time confounded by finding so nearly surrounded during hesitation while attempted to break through here there then turned again several be brought to ground by gun of mounted party till at last a if have summoned up resolution whole herd led by splendid male burst away in direction close to horseman made escape from circle in cloud of dust scattering stone behind a fled caffre ran up to animal lay wounded put out of misery by inserting point of assaguays into spine caused immediate death seven animal be killed three zebra four quagga a swinton have requested that might not be cut up till have ascertained if required skin omrah be sent back to bring to where be lying swinton soon came alexander said to now swinton let know if want of skin of animal to preserve replied swinton have already just thought possible that might have killed zebra well have not there be three of good fellow be not of real zebra specie belong to class described by burchell traveler be termed striped quagga quagga striped quagga a may see have ear of horse while zebra have of as true zebra hardly ever descends upon plain life altogether upon mountainous region occasionally may be found be true be reason why came to see be good eating animal quagga be very indifferent food striped quagga be very passable so if intend to save for dinner pray let be of latter have done hunting to day yes replied major if wilmot be of opinion think have better not work horse more just now plain be so full of large hole ant eater hole bremen say be yes be ant eater hole very dangerous have seen several foot deep if start to day will ask hottentot to try procure one for to night a wish to have stuffed specimen intend to start till to morrow morning replied alexander must dismiss caffre to night that may be also ready to go home to morrow will now have provision enough traveler now rode back to caravan leaving caffre to bring home flesh a soon a have dined chief of warrior be desired to come with men alexander then made man handsome present consisting of tobacco snuff cloth knife bead to chief of band gave three time a much a others then having delivered to very liberal collection of article for king hinza alexander told chief to acquaint king that have be very much pleased with conduct of men thanked majesty for loan of requested that majesty must accept of packet of article have selected for then thanked men for good conduct told to take flesh that wished for journey stated that be at liberty to depart that evening next morning a thought proper caffre be perfectly satisfied with alexander liberality chief of warrior making short speech in reply retired with men well be very sorry that fine fellow be leaving said major so be must not well detain said that must not go further with without king permission replied alexander of course not replied major doe not lessen regret at departure have be steady brave a well a active willing expect that hottentot will serve so well be right not to expect major replied swinton if did must be miserably disappointed if knew now where be going must desert only hold that have upon greater number of be fear go forward because be afraid to go back if must get hold of horse with gun ammunition must leave a soon a advanced in desert very true fear have few stanch fellow among two at least whom can depend upon bremen swanevelt how far be from here to black river swinton about forty mile not so much perhaps to river bed at least that if not more before will fall in with water at season of year must not fail to fill water keg before leave for will have water to night be certain can not travel more than twenty mile over country a for turning here there to avoid hole ant hill twenty mile will be at least thirty said swinton now must go tell hottentot to find what want pound of tobacco will procure have doubt have mine observed major after swinton be gone be too near pool will be surrounded with lion to night hottentot may pretend that will go will not one can not well blame be sure pound of tobacco must not persuade to put head into lion mouth agree with be too near pool a must collect cattle to secure during night think have better fill water keg then yoke take up position for night about mile further off here come swinton who can give advice a swinton agreed with yoked ox drove forward about mile from pool then secured to wagon lighted large fire round caravan major be correct a regarded hottentot procuring ant eater for swinton must not leave fire continual approach of lion during night proved that be wise in so doing there be occasion for lion to roar moaning of begum clinging to major trembling of dog uneasiness of cattle invariably gave notice of lion being at hand shot be fired off during night to keep at distance otherwise night passed away undisturbed started following morning about daybreak at same time caffre took departure to own country ground over caravan traveled be stony sandy at interval have not proceeded far before again discovered great variety of game dispersed over level plain did not however attempt to pursue a be anxious to go on a far a possible so a to give ox opportunity of picking up what little food must during middle of day at time major alexander proposed that must go in pursuit of game before have traveled three hour be surprised at cloud of dust obscured horizon in direction be proceeding what can be said alexander think be springbok said bremen hottentot springbok why there must be thousand thousand of believe that bremen be right said swinton must be one of migratory herd of springbok have never seen have often be told of body of antelope now advanced toward keeping on straight path to state number must have be impossible there might have be fifty hundred thousand more a far a eye must see in direction be one moving mass covering whole plain a approached caravan nearest huddled on one side occasionally bounded away with remarkable spring made by animal from have name alighting not upon earth for want of room upon back of companion then dropping in between rank hazy vapor arose from countless herd a moved on more than once hottentot who be standing on wagon have be stopped a herd came up to pointed out lion be journeying with crowd to feast at leisure animal appeared very tame several be killed close to wheel of wagon for evening supper notwithstanding that herd moved at rapid pace be more than two hour before whole have passed by well observed alexander can now say have seen want of game in africa where will go to will go directly on to southward replied migration of animal be one of most remarkable proof of fecundity of animal life like ant devour thing before if journey in direction have come from will find food for cattle until after rain after rain fall animal will return to former pasture be want of food have brought so far to southward track be evidently from north eastward said major have not better change course more to northward must think not have probably traveled on side of nu gariep black river will have water food for cattle to night therefore think have better go on a be going so a to make sure of water for to morrow at event be useless now stopping to feed cattle have better continue right on till evening will sooner arrive at river so gain by be hour before dark that unyoked tired ox water grass there be none what be misfortune must not find sufficient wood of kind to keep up necessary fire during night must collect before dark be enough for one fire considered better therefore that only one must be lighted wagon be drawn up so a to form square inside of be tied horse sheep be driven underneath ox be tied up outside feasted well upon delicate meat of springbok poor animal have food water after hard day journey a soon a have supped retired to wagon hottentot remained by side of fire be frugally supplied that might last till morning that there be lion prowling in vicinity be evident from restlessness of ox who tried to break leathern thong with be fastened moon have just risen showed imperfect light when perceived body of animal between horizon appeared very large a always do in imperfect light hottentot soon made out that be five six lion not forty yard distant truth of supposition be confirmed by angry roar from one of induced most of hottentot to seize gun to creep under wagon ox now struggled furiously to escape for roar of lion have spread consternation traveler heard in wagon be out with gun in minute at last one of ox broke loose a be running behind companion a if seeking more secure shelter being not more than three four yard from roar be followed by spring of one of lion bore animal to earth major be advancing before fire to attack when animal for moment let go prey be about to spring upon bremen called out for to retreat did a animal advanced step by step toward satisfied with retiring lion then went to prey dragged to distance of about fifty yard where commenced meal distinctly heard although must not plainly distinguish tearing of animal flesh breaking of bone by lion while bellowing be most pitiful now fired in direction where heard noise lion replied to volley by tremendous roar rushed up within twenty yard of wagon so a to be distinctly visible bremen begged traveler not to molest animal a be evidently very hungry very angry must certainly make spring upon must be attended with disastrous effect other lion be also now moving round round camp therefore reloaded gun remained still looking at lion tearing devouring prey must be quiet here said bremen to alexander there be many lion round fire be not sufficient to scare away may attack must not be better to fire gun must frighten sir must frighten other lion perhaps must enrage one so near to must certainly make charge have better throw little gunpowder upon ash now then a have small fire flash will drive away for time in mean time lion be making meal upon poor ox when other of hungry lion approached must rush at pursue for pace with horrible growl made not only poor ox men also to shudder a heard in manner be night passed away one with gun in hand expecting immediate attack morning at last dawned to great relief of lion have disappeared walked out to where old lion have made meal found that have devoured nearly whole of ox such be enormous strength of jaw that rib bone be demolished bone of leg be known a marrow bone be broken a if by hammer really observed major have more respect for lion more become intimate with feline majesty well be off observed swinton think have better be off too chapter xviii ox be yoked caravan proceeded at slow pace to gain wished for river a traveler walked horse for poor animal have be without food water for twenty four hour idea of chasing various herd of animal be to be seen in path be abandoned for present swinton remarked be not far from track of mantatees when made irruption upon caffre about eighteen month back be intending to ask for information on point swinton there have be more than one irruption into country from native to northward mr fairburn gave very fair idea of history of cape colony be too much engaged after arrival in cape town for to obtain further information will may be assured tell know replied swinton must not expect to find in mr fairburn may a well remark that africa appears to be country not able to afford support to dense population like europe chief cause of be great want of water occasionally rendered more trying by drought of four five year continuance grant that such be case at present observed major well know that be not that there be not sufficient quantity of rain fall generally once year because water fall be carried off so quickly river become torrent in few week pour water into sea leaving may say none for remainder of year be true replied swinton so will be until population be not only dense may add sufficiently enlightened industrious then presume will take same measure for securing supply of water throughout year have be so long adopted in india be formerly in south america by mexican mean that of digging large tank from water can not escape except by evaporation believe that will be only remedy not only remedy more than remedy for tank once established vegetation will flourish vegetation will not only husband water in country attract more be very true replied swinton trust time will come when not only land may be well watered with dew of heaven that river of grace may flow through in direction tree of christ may flourish amen replied alexander to resume thread of discourse continued swinton be about to say that increase of population may add increase of rich for in nomadic tribe cattle be only rich be great cause of descent from north for continued drought have mentioned of four five year compel to seek for pasture elsewhere after own be burned up at event appears that caffre nation have be continually sustaining pressure from without from northward southward for many year when dutch settled at cape took possession of country belonging to hottentot tribe driving few chose to preserve independence into bushman namaqua land increasing population in country be only able to afford subsistence to very scattered few then again encroached upon caffre driving first beyond great fish river afterward still more to northward bushman tribe of hill hottentot if may so term have also be increased by various mean notwithstanding constant massacre of unhappy people by dutch boor moreover have by injudicious colonial regulation added new race of people who be already considerable in number do refer to to people now known by name of griquas from having taken possession of griqua country be mixed race between hottentot white by dutch colonial law people must not hold possession of land in colony act of injustice folly have deprived of very valuable race of men who might have added much to prosperity of colony brave intelligent industrious to great degree finding despised on account of hottentot blood in vein have migrated from colony settled beyond boundary being tolerably well provided with fire arm who be peaceably inclined can protect while who be otherwise commit great depredation upon poor savage following example shown by colonist sweeping off cattle property in defiance of law justice now perceive alexander how be that there have be pressure from southward be very evident replied major perhaps have better proceed to northward by degree make mention of caffre tribe be who have suffered from being a be pressed between encroachment from north south caffre race be very numerous origin of general term caffre mean infidel more be not known more than be that of term hottentot proof of what found out at school observed major nickname a be termed stick longer than real one precisely replied swinton acquaintance be mostly with more southern caffre who occupy land bordering on east coast of africa from cape boundary to port natal be amakosa tribe whose warrior have just left tambookies whose territory have recently quitted to northward of by port natal hambonas be eastern caffre on other side of mambookei chain of mountain in central portion of africa below tropic be bechuana who inhabit extent of country a yet imperfectly known to may be termed central caffre on western side of african coast above namaqua land whose inhabitant be probably chiefly of hottentot race have damaras who may be classed a western caffre with have have little communication tribe speak bechuana caffre language with very slight variation be governed by chief king subdivided into numerous body be caffre of character have only to observe a far a have experienced caffre of eastern coast have just left be very superior to others in courage in other good quality now have made intelligible alexander most clearly so nevertheless wish be sitting down in safe place instead of traveling on horseback over withered tract have map before to make understand better will refer to map a soon a can replied alexander have studied map great deal therefore so much require caffre tribe live much same life wealth be in cattle be partly husbandman partly herdsman partly hunter continual conflict with wild beast of country prepare for warrior eastern caffre from whom have lately parted be most populous indeed now that have taken from so much of country have scarcely pasturage for cattle have said that eastern caffre territory extends a far a latitude of port natal formerly extended much further to northward a did to southward before drove from territory indeed a far north a delagoa bay country between port natal delagoa bay being formerly inhabited by tribe of caffre believe alexander mr fairburn gave history of celebrated monarch chaka king of zulu yes did well be chaka who overran that country be now speaking of drove out tribe who occupied a well a large portion of bechuana tribe who inhabited land more to northward now irruption have have into caffre bechuana country bordering upon colony have be wholly brought about by devastation committed by chaka of course refer to irruption have taken place since knowledge possession of cape have doubt that such irruption have be continued that have occurred once in century for age have be brought about by population increasing beyond mean of subsistence have taken place a soon a overplus have required migration of springbok witnessed yesterday may be more frequent be not more certain than of central population of africa caffre state that formerly came from northward won territory by conquest hottentot have same tradition a regard invasion of mantatees a be called by eastern caffre ficani be nothing more than of people dispossessed of property driven from territory by zoolus under chaka indeed last array under quetoo have be destroyed within month may be considered a invading from similar cause having separated from chaka quetoo must find resting place therefore came to southward with intention of wresting territory from caffre in have failed have not failed be cut off by caffre must have destroyed thus made room for own people of course for end of invasion migration must be in such sacrifice of human life a to afford sustenance mean of subsistence to who remain observed major precisely such must continue to be case on continent until art civilization have taught men how to increase mean of subsistence to produce christianity must be introduced for christianity civilization go hand in hand mantatees ficani who be have already said be northern caffre tribe dispossessed of territory by chaka name of tribe know mantatee in caffre language signifies invader ficani also marauder term applicable to people certainly not name of tribe believe now have said enough on subject to allow to enter upon history of last invasion to tell truth heat be so overpowering feel tongue so parched that must excuse for deferring account till opportunity a soon a be little more at ease will give history of mantatees be much obliged to for what have told swinton will spare for present replied alexander what animal be look be gnoos replied swinton there be two variety of common gnoo brindled gnoo form intermediate link between antelope family bovine ox be very good eating then wish be able to go after seem to be afraid of approach nearer at gallop make yes although shy have great deal of curiosity replied swinton watch now animal bounded away again a swinton spoke then returned to gaze upon caravan stirring up dust with hoof tossing mane lashing side with long tail a curvetted shook head sometimes stamping a if in defiance then flying away like wind a if from fear be safe time observed major henderson day will try mettle will find fierce dangerous when wounded sir said bremen who have ridden up be not many mile from river for cattle begin to sniff be delighted to hear say so for then there must be water near haze glare together be so great that can not distinguish above two mile if so much sir replied hottentot can see well enough to see continued pointing with finger to rising ground about hundred yard off on right of one two three there be five of be said major looking in direction pointed out see be lion yes sir must take notice of will not annoy be not hungry be right said swinton must go right on stopping hastening speed let driver look to ox for tired a be smell of lion be sufficient to give ungovernable strength for moment well said major bring gun bremen be willing to accept armed neutrality if will consent to caravan passed on lion remaining crouched where be eying be true not rising from bed ox however through fear of lion scent of water near became more brisk in motion in hour perceived line of tree before told that be near bed of nu gariep cradock river poor animal redoubled exertion soon arrived at bank bremen have ridden forward reported that there still be water in river only in pool a herbage be destroyed on side where be must have crossed bed of river before unyoked that found impossible animal be so impatient for water have not be released must have broken wagon horse ox sheep plunged into pool together for minute appeared a though must never be satisfied at last went out soon returned again till side be distended with quantity of element have imbibed hour be allowed for animal to rest enjoy then be again yoked to drag wagon to other side of river where there be sufficiency of pasturage of wood to make up fire a be intention to remain there for day two wagon be drawn up at distance from river so a not to interfere with path by wild animal went down to drink spoor track of lion buffalo other animal be so abundant a to show that precaution be necessary a soon a wagon be arranged in usual manner cattle be permitted to graze till evening when be brought in secured a usual inside round wagon supped off remainder of springbok be not very sweet horse men be too much exhausted with fatiguing journey to hunt until following day night be not disturbed by lion hyena contrived to crawl under wagon having severely bitten one of ox succeeded in carrying off one of sheep have be so often annoyed by animal that have never mentioned on following morning be found that ox have be so seriously injured that leg bone be broken be obliged to destroy animal be courage of hyena equal to strength must be most formidable animal observed swinton fact be seldom never attack mankind although there may be twenty in troop at same time among caffre very often do enter hut of native occasionally devour child infirm people be greatly owing to encouragement receive from custom of caffre leaving dead to be devoured by animal give liking for human flesh make more bold to obtain must have tremendous power in jaw observed alexander have be given for wise purpose hyena vulture be scavenger of tropical region hyena devours what vulture leaf be skin bone of dead carcass power of jaw be so great that break largest bone with facility be there many variety of in africa there be four common spotted hyena wolf of colonist whose smell be so offensive that dog leave with disgust after be killed own fellow will however devour immediately striped ferocious hyena called shard wolf colonist call bay wolf believe to be one known a laughing hyena there be variety be sort of link between hyena dog called venatica hunt in pack colonist term wild honde be first classed by burchell traveler last be smaller much fiercer than others know that there be leopard in country have never yet fallen in with one be dangerous leopard shuns conflict with man when driven to desperation becomes formidable antagonist recollect very well two boor having attacked leopard animal being hotly pressed by wounded turned round sprang upon one nearest pulling to ground biting shoulder tearing with claw other seeing danger of comrade sprang from horse attempted to shoot animal through head missed leopard left first man sprang upon striking on face tore scalp down over eye hunter grappled with animal at last rolled together down steep cliff a soon a first hunter must reload gun rushed after to save friend be too late animal have seized by throat mangled so dreadfully that death be inevitable that man must do be to avenge comrade death by shooting leopard prof leopard be not to be trifled with animal be when stand at bay be driven to desperation in confirmation of once witnessed one of animal quagga being pressed to edge of precipice by mounted hunter seized man foot with teeth actually tore off so that although medical aid be at hand man died from loss of blood one must hardly expect such tragical issue to chase of wild jackass observed major 'in midst of life be in death never know from whence blow may come until occurred event be supposed impossible very idea must have created nothing ridicule by by one of good missionary be very near losing life by leopard went to save hottentot who have be seized be attacked by leopard a in former instance left first antagonist to meet second fortunately mr s be very powerful man assistance be sooner given than in former instance hottentot however escaped without severe wound confined for many week be there more than one variety of leopard swinton yes there be common leopard hunting leopard besides think two three smaller variety a tiger cat wild cat what do propose doing to day do stay here advance wilmot why major wish to have shot at gnoos have never killed one yet a be of opinion that day rest will recover ox be in hurry think may a well stop provision camp for few day with heart be sorry that hyena have added to store by obliging to kill poor ox however can not be helped there be large body of gnoos quagga under small hill to westward there be better animal for table when get little further to northward be eland largest of antelope specie sometimes weighing more than thousand pound moreover be very fat very easy to run down be excellent eating when be in namaquas land preferred to other food see variety of game on plain there what omrah pointed out be bushman tame bushman a be called in contradistinction to others else korannas most probably latter be coming right towards mahomed say breakfast be ready by time that breakfast be finished party of twelve korannas have joined caravan made sign that be hungry pointing to strap confined stomach interpreter told that be about to hunt that must have of game at be much pleased do know what strap be called round waist wilmot said swinton be called belt of famine native wear when hard pressed by hunger say that be great relief have doubt such be fact well said major hope soon to enable poor fellow to loosen belt fill stomach till be a tight a drum saddle horse bremen omrah ride spare horse carry spare rifle omrah who now understood english although spoke few word gave nod of head went off to wagon for major rifle chapter xix a soon a horse be ready traveler set out in chase of gnoos quagga be collected to westward of caravan bremen swanevelt omrah be mounted ten of hottentot followed with gun korannas on foot among others big adam who have be explaining to who have never seen gnoos manner in used to kill herd permitted to approach within two hundred yard of then after curvetting prancing galloping in small circle stood still at about same distance looking with curiosity anger mixed at horseman after time took to heel scoured plain for about two mile when again stopped tossing head mane stamping a if in defiance mounted party remained quiet till on foot have again drawn near hottentot firing gun drove herd within shot of traveler gun three of gnoos fell while others bounded off to greater distance a neared caravan again started back be again closed in by whole party hottentot now advanced cautiously creeping a near a must to animal whose attention be directed to horseman hottentot be nearly within range when omrah who be mounted on major spare horse fastened to ramrod of major rifle red bandanna handkerchief usually wore round head separating quickly from rest of horseman walked horse to where big adam be creeping along to gain shot stationed behind waving red handkerchief at animal omrah be well aware that gnoo be a much irritated at red handkerchief a bull a soon a commenced waving one of largest male stepped out in direction pawing ground preparing for charge big adam who have idea that omrah be so occupied behind now rose to have shot just a rose gnoo made charge big adam being between gnoo horse omrah rode be of course party against whom animal choler be raised omrah a soon a animal charged have wheeled round galloped away while in meantime big adam perceiving animal rushing at lost presence of mind gun went off without effect turned tail horn of gnoo be close upon when of sudden to surprise of who be looking on big adam disappeared gnoo passed over where have be why what have become of said alexander laughing know think have have wonderful escape replied major have disappeared like ghost through trap door see heel cried swinton laughing have fallen into ant eater hole depend upon mischievous little urchin might have caused death be only to make prove steady aim be boasting so much about replied major stop moment will bring down gallant little animal then will look for big adam before major must get near enough to gnoo be still tearing up ground looking for adversary omrah who have put by handkerchief advanced with major rifle brought animal down volley be at same time discharged at herd by hottentot three more fell after remainder scampered away be soon out of sight then rode up to where big adam have disappeared found a swinton have supposed in deep ant eater hole head downward bellowing for help foot be just above surface be hottentot helped out big adam threw on back seemed exhausted with fright having be so long in reversed position be more vexed at laugh be raised against gnoos be soon cut up when hottentot have taken away a much a required rest of carcass be made over to hungry korannas swinton shook head at omrah who pretended that did not understand why until laughter of alexander major be joined in by swinton a have pretty well fatigued horse in chase resolved to return to caravan keep a fresh a must for future service dined supped on flesh of gnoos be approved of after supper alexander said now swinton if feel inclined major will be very glad to hear history of mantatees with pleasure replied assemblage of tribe known a mantatees invader according to best authority can collect inhabited country to westward of zoolu territory in same latitude be that of delagoa bay a tribe subsist almost entirely upon flesh milk of cattle if deprived of be driven to desperation must become robber in turn perish by hunger such be case of mantatees unable to withstand attack of zoolus be driven from country joined force with others who have shared same fate such be origin of mantatees who although have not courage to withstand attack of zoolus be stimulated by desperation famine to most extraordinary courage in attack made upon others forming immense body now that be collected together accompanied by wife child unable to procure necessary subsistence be certain that habit be so far changed that at last became cannibal be driven to prey upon dead body of enemy flesh of comrade who fell in combat bechuana tribe who be caffre of interior be first assailed town sacked burned cattle seized devoured proceeded on to wankeets one of damara tribe who inhabit western coast to northward of namaqua land wankeets be brave people prepared for mantatees be driven back with great slaughter astounded at defeat turned to southward invaded bechuana country at time missionary have established at koranna when report of mantatees advancing be brought to bechuana be in great consternation for although finer looking men than eastern caffre be not by mean so brave warlike a advance of people must have be ruin of mission a well a destruction of tribe who be afraid to encounter mr m missionary determined upon sending for assistance of griquas people whom have before mentioned who have not only horse be well armed griquas came under chief waterboer marched against enemy accompanied by large army of bechuana who encouraged by presence of griquas now went forth to combat mantatees have at time advanced a far have taken possession of litakoo bechuana town containing inhabitant will now give a nearly a can recollect account of mr m missionary at kuruman who accompanied griquas to propose effect if be possible amicable arrangement with invader told that a proceeded with small party ahead of griqua force to effect purpose passed by number of enemy who have advanced to pool to drink have there sunk down expired from famine a neared mass of enemy found that cattle have captured be inclosed in center of vast multitude attempted parley enemy started forward hurled spear with most savage fury be compelled to retreat finding hope of obtaining parley next day be decided that griquas must advance numbered about one hundred well mounted well armed men enemy flew at with terrible howl hurling javelin club black dismal appearance savage fury hoarse loud voice producing strange effect griquas to prevent being surrounded very wisely retreated be at last decided that griquas must fire be hoped that a mantatees have never seen effect of fire arm must be humbled alarmed thus further bloodshed might be prevented many of mantatees fell although survivor looked with astonishment upon dead wounded warrior writhing in dust flew with lion like vengeance at horseman wrenching weapon from hand of dying companion to replace have already discharged at antagonist a who thus stepped out from main body to attack griquas be chief of mantatees many of be killed death one after other disheartened whole body after griquas have commenced attack bechuana army came up assisted with poisoned arrow with plied enemy small body of fierce mantatees sallying out put whole of bechuana to flight after combat of two hour half griquas finding ammunition failing determined at great risk to charge whole body did so mantatees gave way fled in westerly direction be intercepted by griquas charge being made whole be pell mell confusion mr m say that scene now presented be most awful state of suspense most cruel undulating country around be covered with warrior griquas mantatees bechuana in motion so that be impossible to say who be enemy who be friend cloud of dust rose from immense mass flying others pursuing to scream yell be added bellowing of ox shout of yet unvanquished warrior groan of dying wail of woman of child at last enemy retreated to town set in flame to add to horror of scene then desperate struggle ensued mantatees attempted to inclose griquas in burning town not succeeding fled precipitately strange to say mantatee force be divided into two part during time that griquas engaged one other remained in town having such confidence in former that did not come to assistance when town be set on fire army united retreated together to northward in body of not le than warrior a soon a mantatees retreated bechuana commenced work of slaughter woman child be butchered without mercy a for wounded mantatees appeared a if nothing must make yield there be many instance of individual being surrounded by fifty bechuana a long a life remained fought mr m say that saw more than one instance of mantatee fighting wildly against number with ten twelve arrow spear pierced in body struggling with death men must rally raise from ground discharge weapon fall dead revengeful hostile spirit only ceasing when life be extinct yet same people permitted own country to be taken from by zoolus yes be so want necessity have turned into desperate warrior wonder never thought of going back recovering own country must have be match for zoolus be that end of history swinton not quite perhaps be tired oh pray go on mantatees although defeated by griquas soon recovered courage intelligence came that be about to make descent upon kuruman where missionary have station mantatees having be informed that griquas have gone home now determined to revenge upon bechuana whom considered a dust under foot on information mr m wrote to waterboer who commanded griquas requesting immediate return waterboer replied that immense body of mantatees be coming down upon griquas by val yellow river that be forced to remain to defend own property advising mr m to retreat with family to griqua town put under protection a must no longer remain mission station be abandoned missionary with wife family retreated to griqua town have not however be long at griqua town before news arrived that body of mantatees have altered route one portion of went eastward toward country from have be driven by zoolus appears took possession of country near source of orange river where for many year carried on predatory warfare with tribe in district at last portion of be incorporated settled down on part be now known a mantatee new country remainder made irruption into eastern caffre country where be known a ficani what became of defeated one two of caffre chief caffre implored assistance of english colonist be granted large armed force be sent out against invader be found located for have built town near source of umtata river caffre joined with force ficani be surprised horrid slaughter took place musket artillery congreve rocket be poured upon unfortunate wretch who be hemmed in on side by caffre unfortunate ficani may be said to have be exterminated for caffre spared man woman child such be history of mantatees destruction be horrible perhaps unavoidable very true observed alexander can not help thinking that desolating contest like be permitted by controlling providence a chastisement yet with gracious end for surely be better that must meet with immediate death than linger till famine put end to misery be certain that must have be destroyed others destroyed to make room for in case great sacrifice of life be to be incurred war dreadful a be in detail appears to be one of necessary evil of human existence mean by increase so rapidly a to devour other know whether have made observation appears to plague cholera be almost necessary in country where break out be very remarkable that latter disease never made appearance in europe at least not for century may say until after peace have be established increase of population be so rapid during many year that europe be devastated population thinned by war have cholera little of one two other epidemic have since be very fatal what mean to infer be that hand of providence may be seen in thus sanguinary war desolating ravage of disease be in afflictive visitation probably chastisement for national sin may nevertheless have effect in case of preventing misery result from undue increase of population may be quite right alexander observed way of heaven be inscrutably mysterious when offer up prayer for removal of what may appear to be heavy calamity may be deprecating in end may prove mercy one thing must not help remarking in narrative swinton observed major be position of missionary during scene of terror passed slightly over must have be most trying most surely be yet have not only read heard much said against strong opposition made to subscription for support grant be because people know that great deal of money have be subscribed know us to be applied hear report read find perhaps that light of gospel have a yet glimmered in one place that in other place labor have hitherto be thrown away forget that be grain of mustard seed be to become great tree spread branch wish for immoderate return be therefore disappointed of course can not give opinion a to manner in mission be conducted in other country a have visited most of mission in part can honestly assert think have already seen enough to agree with that money intrusted to society be not thrown away lavishly expended missionary labor with own hand almost provide for own support there agree with swinton replied alexander be objection raised against for now have seen with own eye can not imagine what can be objection have heard have so often attempted to refute be that generality of missionary be fanatical class of men who be more anxious to inculcate peculiar tenet of own sect denomination than religion of saviour that most of be uneducated vulgar men many of very intemperate very injudicious few of of bad moral character that exertion if have used whether to civilize to christianize people among whom be sent have not be followed by commensurate result now let have reply to many objection be doubt true that missionary who be laboring among savage of interior be many if not most of people of limited education indeed major portion of have be brought up a mechanic much question whether men of higher attainment more cultivated mind must be better adapted to meet capacity of unintellectual barbarian highly educated man may be appreciated among who be educated how can be appreciated by savage on contrary savage look with much more respect upon man who can forge iron repair weapon excite astonishment by cunning workmanship for then savage perceives acknowledges superiority in man of intellect must never discover besides admitting that must be preferable to employ person of higher mental attainment where be to be found must expect when so many laborer be required in vineyard sufficient number of volunteer among young men brought up at university must be able to submit to privation incur hardship to african missionary be exposed must be able to work hard labor for daily bread be willing to encounter such toil such danger a must be encountered by who be sent here fear not allow here to remark at first preaching of christianity be not talented educated men who be selected by saviour out of twelve apostle paul be only one who have such claim if have beheld galilean fisherman mending net must have ever imagined that humble laborer be to be people who must afterward regenerate world must overthrow idolatry crumble superstition of ancient empire kingdom what uneducated admit divinely inspired supported have taught must be joyfully received a be now may say from rising to setting of sun to utmost boundary of earth most truly most admirably argued swinton replied alexander almighty a if to prove how insignificant in sight be human power have often made use of meanest instrument to accomplish greatest end who know that even keeping sabbath day in desert may be productive of good be humble mean of advancing divine cause must ever bear in mind counsel 'in morning sow thy seed in evening withhold not thy hand for thou knowest not whether will prosper that whether will be alike good ' surely so replied swinton native consider a superior race see worship be led to think must be right perceive be done by to whom look up a superior may induce to inquire to receive information eventually to be enrolled among follower of saviour be however not to be denied that in few instance person have be chosen for office of missionary who have proved unworthy must will ever be case where human agent be employed argues more against general respectability utility of missionary a body than admission of traitor juda among apostle to efficacy of work zeal in cause having visited station have hesitation in bearing testimony indeed can not admire exemplary fortitude wonderful patience perseverance missionary have displayed devoted men be to be found in remotest desert accompanying wild wandering savage from place to place suffering from hunger from thirst destitute of almost comfort at time without even necessary of life of have without murmuring spent whole life in such service yet zeal be set down a fanaticism by who remain at home assert that money raised for equipment be thrown away happily have not looked for reward in world have built hope upon be to come that people who joined mission station have become more civilized that be very superior to countryman be certain observed major have seen proof of christianity having produced remarkably good effect among native mean one might be brought forward a convincing evidence to who have shown inimical lukewarm in cause yes replied history of africaner be one there be others although not so prominent a of party to whom refer well swinton must now be again taxed must give history of africaner will with pleasure that may be able to narrate when required in support of mission africaner be chief descendant of chief of hottentot nation who once pastured own flock herd on own native hill within hundred mile of cape town a dutch colonist at cape increased so did a mr fairburn have stated to alexander dispossess hottentot of land hottentot unable to oppose invader gradually found more more remote from possession of forefather after time africaner diminished clan found compelled to join take service under dutch boor for time proved most faithful shepherd in looking after securing herd of employer have dutch boor behaved with common humanity not to say gratitude toward who served so well might now have be alive like rest of countryman considered hottentot a mere beast of burden at momentary anger be murdered hunted down a if be wild animal africaner saw clan daily diminished by barbarity of feudal master at last resolved upon further submission a bushman be continually making attempt upon cattle of boor africaner people have not only be well trained to fire arm have constantly in possession assumed master having idea that there must be revolt resolved upon sending portion of africaner people to distant spot where intended to secure by destruction weaken power of clan a be sort of magistrate have power to enforce africaner suspecting view resolved to defeat order after order be sent to hut of africaner people positively refused to comply requested to be paid for long service be permitted to retire further into interior be sternly denied be ordered to appear at house of boor fearful of violence yet accustomed to obey order africaner brother went up one of brother concealed gun under cloak on arrival boor came out felled africaner to ground brother immediately shot boor with gun thus did miscreant meet with just reward of villainy murder wife who have witnessed murder of husband shrieked implored mercy told that need not be alarmed requested that gun ammunition in house must be delivered up to be immediately done africaner then hastened back to people collected cattle with what effect must take with directed course to orange river be soon out of reach of pursuer for required time in so scattered district to collect sufficient force africaner fixed abode upon bank of orange river afterward chief ceding to dominion in great namaqua land territory became by right a well a by conquest think have better leave off now be getting late must to bed if be to start early to morrow morning will have mercy upon swinton defer impatience said major good night to may not have lion serenade hope not music be too loud to be agreeable good night chapter xx having filled water keg next morning at day light yoked ox left bank of cradock black river to proceed more to northward through bushman country a be aware that there be water to be procured if quitted stream altogether till arrived at val yellow river decided upon following course of black river to westward for time before struck off for val yellow river near to expected to fall in with plenty of game particularly giraffe rhinoceros although at season of year river be nearly dry still there be scanty herbage on near bank intermixed with bed of rush high reed be sufficient for pasture of cattle be infested with lion other animal at dry season of year kept near river bank for supply of water by noon have proceeded about fifteen mile to westward a advanced found that supply of water in river be more abundant then unyoked cattle to allow to feed till evening for be too dangerous to turn loose at night a be in hurry resolved that must only travel for future from daylight till noon afternoon evening be to be spent in hunting at night be to halt caravan secure thing a before by inclosing horse sheep tying up ox by arrangement cattle must not be exhausted with labor must have time to follow object of journey that of hunting wild animal with country abounded also of procuring constant supply of food for attendant having now traveled a far a wished stopped at foot of rising ground about quarter of mile from river bank be on outskirt of large clump of mimosa other tree a soon a cattle be unyoked have gone down to river to drink traveler ordered horse to be saddled a bank of river on side be low rode up to rising ground to view country beyond to ascertain what game might be in sight when arrived at summit be threading way through tree omrah pointed to broken branch said elephant here not long ago bremen said that omrah be right that animal must not have left more than week probably have followed course of stream print of foot be observed by omrah pointed out not knowing name to give animal in english dutch imitated motion doe mean gnoo said alexander omrah shook head raising hand up motioned that animal be twice a big come here bremen what print of hoof be said swinton buffalo sir fresh print be here last night be animal be anxious to slay said major must be very careful that doe not slay replied swinton for be most dangerous beast almost a much so a lion well must not return without one at event said alexander without lion also a soon a can find one alone have seen in daytime have always be in three four think odds too great with party first single lion fall in with vote try for skin agreed replied major what do say swinton why say agreed also a came here to look for other thing rather than lion must say a far a be concerned that best part of valor must be discretion however depend upon if go after lion will be with have often be at destruction of when with dutch boor then recollect have horse to spare therefore must not exactly follow method how do hunt lion then inquired alexander hunt more for self defense than for pleasure replied swinton on outskirt of colony lion be so destructive to herd that colonist must destroy generally go out ten twelve of with long gun not fewer if possible must recollect that boor be not only very cool brave men most excellent shot fear will not find that number among present party a with exception of three self breman swanevelt believe that there be one man here who must face lion so that when do attack one will be at disadvantage dutch boor a soon a have ascertained where lion lie approach bush to within moderate distance then alighting make horse fast together with bridle halter in there be danger a sometimes lion will spring out upon at once if so probably not only horse men be sacrificed if lion remains quiet be usually case advance toward within thirty pace thereabouts a know that generally make spring at distance a advance back horse toward a shield in front of knowing that lion will spring upon horse a move forward lion at first look at very calmly very often wag tail a if in playful humor when approach nearer growl a if to warn off then a continue to approach gradually draw up hind leg under body ready for spring at a soon a be within distance see nothing of except bristling mane eye glaring like fire for be then fully enraged in act of springing next moment be critical moment signal be given for party to fire if be not successful in laying dead on spot with first volley spring like thunderbolt upon horse remainder of party then fire seldom fail to put end to generally one more of horse be killed so wounded a to be destroyed in consequence sometimes although rarely one more of hunter share same fate so observe that with advantage be service of danger therefore must not be undertaken without due precaution very true swinton will never do to return to cape without having killed lion a please even must be better than being killed by lion not returning at however opinion be that will have to kill lion before have traveled much further without going in quest of there be hundred of here a many a there be in namaqua land look master said bremen pointing to seven eight splendid antelope about mile distant see replied major be gemsbok said swinton now will thank for specimen of beautiful creature if can get for must dismount leave horse here crawl along from tree to tree bush to bush till get within shot be indeed noble animal look at large male appears to be leader master of herd what splendid horn cried alexander give horse to omrah swanevelt bremen will go with hist not word be looking in direction said major recollect to try for large male want most particularly said swinton master said bremen must creep till get bush between game then can crawl through bush get good shot yes will be best plan said swinton a softly a can for be very shy animal followed one for two three hundred yard creeping from one covert to till have placed bush on plain between herd then stopped little reconnoitered herd of antelope have left off feeding now have head turned toward bush in direction where be concealed large male rather in advance of others with long horn pointing forward nose close to ground party kept silence for time watching animal none of moved much from position a for male remained a if be statue must have scented whispered alexander sir said wind blow from to ca think what be about perhaps may have seen at event will gain nothing by remaining here will be more concealed a descend approach observed major be true so come along creep like mouse said swinton did so at last arrived at patch of brushwood be between antelope be now peeping creeping to find out opening to fire through when heard rustling within bremen touched sleeve of major beckoned retreat motioned to others before must decide a did not know why hottentot proposed for did not speak put hand to mouth a hint to to be silent roar like thunder came from bush within three yard of accompanied with rushing noise must not be mistaken be roar spring of lion looked round amazed stunned to ascertain who be victim merciful heaven exclaimed alexander one hurt master lion spring at antelope now will find on other side of bush kill easy when eye be shut bremen led way round copse followed by traveler soon arrived on other side of with gun ready on arrival to astonishment perceived lion male gemsbok lying together antelope be dead lion still alive though horn of gemsbok have passed through body at sight of hunter lion pierced through a be raised head with loud roar struck out with paw a twisted toward eye glowing like hot coal showing tremendous fang alexander be first who fired ball penetrating brain of noble animal fell down dead upon body of antelope be finest sight ever witnessed observed swinton have heard that gemsbok horn be sometimes fatal to lion must hardly credit have passed nearly through body point be under skin now know master why gemsbok have nose to ground horn pointed said bremen saw lion fought to save herd be quite stunned yet observed alexander what noble animal be well at event can say have shot lion be more than can major only wish that when shoot one may have more danger to incur replied major what different idea doe one have of lion in menagerie one in free native state why menagerie lion ca roar at be nothing overgrown cat compared to lion of desert be very true observed swinton however be delighted for now have not only gemsbok be gem above price also a fine lion a have ever seen must like to have stuffed set up just a be before alexander killed rage agony combined be most magnificent after lion be king of beast bremen send swanevelt to caravan for of men must have skin skeleton of antelope skin of lion traveler be quite satisfied with sport of day after waiting for time while hottentot disentangled animal took off skin returned to caravan omrah having secured portion of flesh of gemsbok for supper a be returning observed herd of buffalo at great distance proposed to hunting of after have halted on following day if animal be at reasonable distance from at flesh of antelope be pronounced better than of gnoo after supper a soon a cattle have be all secured fire lighted alexander proposed that swinton must finish history of africaner if remember right left off where africaner people have escaped to namaqua land where became chief attempt be made to take prisoner bring to colony without success expedition after expedition failed africaner dared to approach territory at last colonist have recourse to griquas offered large reward if must bring africaner in griquas commanded by celebrated chief of name of berend made several attempt in consequence cruel war be carried on between berend africaner in party gained advantage africaner discovering that colonist have bribed berend to make war against now turned wrath against dutch boor fell victim to fury carried off large quantity of cattle eventually africaner became terror of colony native also who resided in namaqua land commenced depredation upon africaner repaid with such interest that at last tribe fled at approach name carried dismay into solitary waste courage intrepidity shown by africaner brother in various combat be most remarkable to narrate adventure must occupy too much time be certain that not only became dreaded in consequence of forbearance on several occasion be respected be in that missionary came into namaqua land unfortunately happened that dispute arose about of africaner property be seized at same time africaner lost cattle party who be at variance with africaner lived near to mission station very unwisely people at mission station be permitted to go to assistance roused anger of africaner who vowed vengeance on mission people collected around connected with a africaner have commenced attack upon namaquas be advancing toward mission missionary be compelled to abandon station return to colony mission station be soon afterward taken possession of by africaner house burned to ground curious circumstance occurred during affair follower be seeking everywhere for plunder when of entered burial ground one of treading on apparently new made grave be astonished by soft note of music proceeding from ground beneath superstitious a native be having most of in former day heard something of christian doctrine started stood transfixed with astonishment expecting dead to arise a have be once told one of mustered courage to put foot again upon spot reply be soft musical a before away started to africaner to inform that there be life music in grave chief who feared living dead went to burial ground with men jumped upon spot immediately gave out soft note a before africaner ordered immediate exhumation when source of mystery proved to be piano forte of missionary wife being too cumbrous article to take away have be buried there with hope of being one day able to recover never having seen instrument before africaner have dissected for sake of brass wire thus piano be destroyed doubt if must ever have be dug up in caffreland observed alexander be convinced never must have be have remained a wonder object of fear a long a held together replied swinton to proceed mission station having be for time broken up by attack of africaner mr c missionary anxious to restore wrote letter to africaner on subject received favorable reply mr e be sent to residence of africaner after short time africaner two brother with number of others be baptized at first must be admitted that profession of christianity did not greatly improve conduct be very much to be ascribed to circumstance that duty of station have devolved upon one who ought not to have be selected for task upon removal more fitting minister of gospel taking place great change be soon observable in africaner from having be one of most remorseless pursuer of vengeance firebrand spreading discord war animosity among neighboring tribe must now make concession sacrifice to prevent collision bloodshed between contending party although power be so great that might have raised arm dared to lift spear draw bow must entreat a suppliant to be reconciled at ' must say 'how many battle have fought how much cattle have taken what have done for make full of shame sorrow ' in short from time till died became peacemaker christian in word deed whole life be devoted to act of kindness charity to instructing exhorting following precept of in whose faith eventually lived died well swinton have indeed given remarkable proof that missionary labor be not always thrown away thank for compliance with request be remarkable instance if only consider how many hundred of life might have be sacrificed if africaner have continued career of slaughter of plunder how many life may add have be also saved by interference a peacemaker instead of being a formerly be promoter of war bloodshed swinton said alexander wanted to ask question have nearly forgotten do recollect what bremen said to that lion have seized gemsbok now lion must shut eye that must shoot yes do be correct in what stated for have witnessed when lion seizes large animal like ox horse animal fell martyr to afternoon spring upon seizes by throat with terrible fang hold down with paw till expires from moment lion seizes prey shuts eye never open again until life of prey be extinct remember hottentot when lion have seized ox in way running up to with gun firing within few yard distance lion however did not deign to notice report of gun continued to hold fast prey hottentot loaded again fired again missed reloaded again then shot lion through head how very strange be can not give reason for that be so well know to be fact perhaps may be that animal after long fasting be quite absorbed with grateful taste of blood flowing into mouth while animal be writhing under clutch there be many singular point about lion be much more noble intelligent animal than most people have idea of have collected number of fact relative to majesty must surprise bushman know animal habit so well that seldom come to accident from inhabiting country in really believe population of lion exceeds that of bushman be true that lion a well a other animal be afraid of eye of man said major can reply to question yes can answered swinton be about to say that be be not better answer will be to give have come to knowledge consider that lion be much more dangerous animal in country indeed in other where there be firearm than where occupant be possessed of may appear strange be fixed opinion that lion have idea of deadly nature of firearm that becomes in consequence more afraid of man remember story told of lion watching man for two day without destroying never permitting to lay hold of gun now be satisfactorily proved that lion will pas man who have gun in hand without attacking provided that doe not attempt to level gun moment that doe will spring upon instance of occurred to great lion hunter diedrich muller who mentioned to have be alone hunting in wild when came suddenly upon large lion instead of giving way a usually do seemed disposed from angry attitude assumed to dispute progress muller instantly alighted confident of unerring aim leveled gun at forehead of lion have crouched in act to spring within sixteen pace of a fired horse whose bridle be round arm started back jerking aside caused to miss lion bounded forward stopped within few pace confronting muller who stood defenseless a gun be discharged horse have galloped off man beast stood looking other in face for short time at lion moved backward a if to go away muller began loading gun lion looked over shoulder growled immediately returned to former position within few pace of muller muller stood still with eye fixed on animal lion again moved cautiously off when be at certain distance muller proceeded to ram down bullet lion again looked back growled angrily muller again be quiet animal continued turning growling a moved off till at last bounded away imagine then that lion be aware of fatal effect of fire arm said major must appear so not only on account of being so angry if presented at being touched even when be close to also from greater respect lion pay to man where fire arm be in use respect that pay to men in colony be not general custom of animal a said before lion be more dangerous in bushman country because in first place awe of man have be removed from invariably successful encounter with who have weapon of force with to oppose secondly because have too often tasted human flesh after lion becomes more partial to than other food be asserted that when lion have once succeeded in snatching unfortunate bushman from cave never fails to return regularly night in hope of meal until horde be so harassed that be compelled to seek other shelter from apprehension of such attack be also asserted that bushman be in habit of placing aged infirm people at entrance of cave during night must lion come least valuable most useless of community may first fall prey to animal of course if permitted to help in way lion can not have much fear of man observed wilmot lurking abroad in night take away much from nobleness of disposition be inclined to attribute to by mean continued swinton that lion generally lurks lie in wait to seize prey be certain be general characteristic of feline tribe of may be considered a head be for mode of hunting nature have fitted wolf hound others be furnished with acute scent be enabled to tire down prey by long chase feline tribe be capable of very extraordinary effort of activity speed for very short time if fail to seize prey at first spring after few tremendous bound generally abandon pursuit lion can spring from nine to twelve yard at leap for few second can repeat bound with such activity velocity a to outstrip movement of quickest horse can not continue amazing effort doe not attempt in fact lion be more than gigantic cat must live by obtaining prey in same manner a cat in country prey be chiefly of antelope specie swiftest animal on earth what chance must have if be to give one of magnanimous roar to announce approach know business better crouch in rank grass reed by side of path made by animal to descend to river pool to drink a pas make spring upon now consider that obtaining food a nature have pointed out to be argument against what consider really noble disposition of lion be that doe not kill for mere cruelty that be really generous unless compelled by hunger to destroy a have already shown by one two example be convinced dear swinton said alexander now let have opinion a to being afraid to meet eye of man consider that lion will generally retreat before presence of man doe not retreat cowardly like leopard hyena others never slinks away appears calmly to survey opponent a apparently measuring prowess must say that lion seems to have secret impression that man be not natural prey although will not always give place to will not attack if in first place man show sign of fear in second sign of hostility instinctive deference to man be not to be reckoned upon may be very angry may be very hungry may have be just disappointed in taking prey may be accompanied by female cub in short animal temper may have be ruffled in case becomes dangerous old namaqua chief with whom be conversing who have be accustomed to lion from childhood fully corroborated opinion also that there be that in eye of man before lion quail assured that lion very seldom attack man if not provoked will approach within few pace survey steadily sometimes attempt to get behind a if must not stand look be desirous of springing upon unawares said that if man in such case attempted to fly must run greatest danger that if have presence of mind to confront animal must in almost instance after short time retire now have already brought forward instance of muller lion a proof of effect of man eye upon lion will now give still more convincing a contact be still closer lion have even tasted blood boor of name of gyt be out with one of neighbor hunting coming to fountain surrounded a usual with tall reed rush gyt gave gun to comrade alighted to see if there be water remaining in a approached fountain enormous lion started up close at side seized by left arm gyt although thus taken by surprise stood motionless without struggling for be aware that least attempt to escape must occasion immediate destruction animal also remained motionless holding gyt fast by arm with fang without biting severely at same time shutting eye a if must not withstand eye of victim fixed upon what terrible position yes may here observe that lion be induced to seize man in consequence of coming so completely in contact a be for self defense have be further apart lion must a usually be case have walked away moreover eye of man being so close to have at same time more power over lion so a to induce to shut own to continue a stood in position gyt recovered presence of mind beckoned to comrade to advance with gun shoot lion through head might easily have be done a animal continued still with eye closed gyt body concealed object approaching comrade be cowardly scoundrel instead of coming to gyt assistance cautiously crawled up rock to secure from danger for long while gyt continued earnestly to entreat comrade by sign to come to assistance lion continuing while perfectly quiet in vain how blood boil at conduct of scoundrel said major admitting first impulse to have be fear yet to allow comrade to remain in position so long while cover with infamy think if gyt escaped must have felt very much inclined to shoot wretch lion hunter affirm that if gyt have persevered little longer animal must have at last released hold left gyt uninjured that grip of lion be more from fear that man must hurt than from wish to hurt man such be opinion gyt indignant at cowardice of comrade losing patience with lion at last drew hunting knife boor invariably carry at side with power of right arm thrust into lion breast thrust be deadly one for be aimed with judgment gyt be bold powerful man did not prove effectual so a to save gyt life for enraged lion striving in death agony to grapple with gyt held at arm length by strength of desperation on part of boor so dreadfully lacerated with talon breast arm of poor gyt that bone be left bare at last lion fell dead gyt fell with cowardly companion who have witnessed fearful struggle from rock now took courage to advance carried mangled body of gyt to nearest house medical aid be at hand vainly applied a on third day died of locked jaw such be tragical end of rencounter from sheer cowardice of gyt companion must mention many other instance in lion have have men in power have not injured if have attempted to escape to assault think have given enough already not only to prove fact of general forbearance toward man also that there be something in eye of man at lion other animal believe will quail can myself give instance that fascinating effect whatever may be of human eye be not confined wholly to lion said major one of officer in india having once rambled into jungle adjoining british encampment suddenly encountered bengal tiger meeting be evidently most unexpected on side party made dead halt earnestly gazing at other officer have fire arm with although have regulation sword by side that knew must be of defense if have to struggle for life with fearful antagonist be however man of undaunted courage have heard that even bengal tiger might be checked by looking steadily in face only artillery being like lady that of eye directed point blank at tiger must have infinitely preferred rifle a be not at sure that eye might miss fire however after few minute during tiger have be crouched ready for spring animal appeared disturbed irresolute slunk on one side then attempted to crawl round behind officer of course officer must not permit turned to tiger a tiger turned with same constancy that tom moore say beunflower turn to sun ' tiger then darted into thicket tried to catch by coming suddenly upon from quarter taking by surprise officer be wide awake a may suppose tiger finding that be go at last went off officer immediately went off too a fast a must to encampment be glad to have heard narrative major replied swinton for many doubt have be thrown upon question of power of human eye opinion be very corroborative one imagine that lion tamer who exhibit in europe have taken advantage of peculiar fact have doubt that be one of great help think that resort to other mean have increased instinctive fear that animal have of have witnessed exhibition always observed that man never for moment took eye off animal be playing with commanding have observed that also what be other mean to allude can not positively say can only express opinion most painful most stunning effect of blow upon part of body not only of man of brute be blow on nose many animal such a seal others be killed by immediately there be doubt severe blow on tender part will paralyze almost beast for time give dread for future believe that repeated blow upon nose will go further than other mean to break courage of beast imagine that be resorted to be only opinion recollect must be taken for just a much a be worth think that animal may be tamed by kindness if can produce in necessary proportion of love fear yes be about to say animal believe must be excepted be from having so great fear of man rather than from other cause if fear must be overcome might be tamed of course there be animal have not sufficient reasoning power to admit of being tamed for instance who must ever think of taming scorpion believe that there be one animal although taken a cub have resisted attempt to tame in slightest degree be grizzly bear of north america have heard so too replied swinton at event up to present time have be unsuccessful be animal of most unamiable disposition be certain must rather encounter ten lion if that say of be true be time for to go to bed fire be getting rather low who have watch major rose walked round to find hottentot who be on duty found fast asleep after sundry kick in rib fellow at last woke up be watch yaw mynher replied big adam rolling out of kaross well then keep so well that will have tobacco next time be served out gentleman awake keep watch so go to sleep little replied adam getting up on leg look to fire sir replied major walking to wagon chapter xxi a fully expected to fall in with herd of buffalo a proceeded started very early on following morning have now satisfaction of finding that water be plentiful in river in of large hole passed heard snorting blowing of hippopotamus to great delight of hottentot who be very anxious to procure one being very partial to flesh a traveled day fell in with small party of bushman be shy at first one two of woman at last approached receiving present of snuff tobacco others soon joined a understood from omrah hottentot that be to hunt in afternoon followed caravan with hope of obtaining food be very diminutive race woman although very well formed not being more than four foot high countenance be pleasing be young one one two of must have be pretty have not be so disfigured with grease dirt indeed effluvium from be so unpleasant that traveler be glad that must keep at distance alexander said to swinton be true that lion other animal prefer black man to white a being of higher flavor swinton be only joke must think there must be truth in idea observed major for say that bengal tiger will always take native in preference to european be believe not to be disputed replied swinton that for one european devoured by lion other animal feast upon ten hottentot bushman perhaps more ascribe cause of so doing not exactly to perceiving difference in flesh of black white man indulging preference lion like many other beast of prey be directed to game by scent a well a by eye be certain now appeal to who have got rid of bushman who know so well how odoriferous be skin of hottentot whether lion nose be not much more likely to be attracted by one of of tribe of people than must by how often in traveling have changed position when wind have borne down upon effluvium of hottentot who be driving why effluvium be borne down with wind for mile be a savory to lion have doubt a beefsteak be to there can think be doubt of said alexander be said that will select hottentot from white men doubt of because follow up scent right to party from whence emanates can give instance of be once traveling with dutch farmer with wagon hottentot unyoked lay down on sand for night there be farmer two hottentot men woman by by very fat one who consequently be more heated by journey during night lion came carried away woman from among by track a found on following morning have passed close to farmer be woman killed night be so dark that must see nothing be roused by shriek seized gun be of use recollect instance be not so tragical hottentot be carried off by lion during night wrapped up in sheep skin kaross sleeping a usually do with face to ground a lion trotted away with fellow contrived to wriggle out of kaross lion went off only mantle well must think one of karosses must be very savory morsel for hungry lion said major imagine be almost time to unyoke must have traveled nearly twenty mile forest promise well for game be in search of suspect that contain not only buffalo elephant however will soon find out by examining path down to river make in going for water think that yonder knoll must be good place to fix encampment swinton said major be well shaded with mimosa yet clear of main forest well be quartermaster general must decide major ordered bremen to arrange wagon a usual turn cattle out to feed a soon a have be accomplished saddled horse awaited return of swanevelt who have gone to reconnoiter shortly afterward returned with report that there be track of elephant buffalo lion in direction by river bank a dog must now be of use be ordered to be let loose seldom be unless game be large to be regularly hunted down traveler mounted proceeded into forest accompanied by hottentot except cattle keeper bushman bremen swanevelt omrah only being on horseback a well a a rode forward slowly cautiously at outset swinton asked major whether have ever shot buffalo yes in india replied major desperate animal be in country be about to say that will find such here alexander must be very careful in first place leaden bullet be of little use against tough hide may almost say impenetrable forehead best shot be under fore shoulder ball be hardened with tin observed alexander know that replied swinton still be most dangerous animal especially if fall in with single buffalo be much safer to attack herd have time to talk over matter now only a say be very careful do approach one be wounded even if be down on knee here come bremen with news hottentot came up announced that there be large herd of buffalo on other side of hill proposed that must take sweep round so a to drive toward river proposal be considered good be acted upon after riding about mile gained position seemed most desirable dog be then let loose hottentot on foot spread on side shouting so a to drive animal before herd collected together for short while stood at bay with large bull in front then set off through forest toward river followed by hunter on horse on foot in quarter of hour whole herd have taken refuge in large pool in river with reed rush small island in center occupied long slip of ground major with swanevelt two other hottentot proceeded further up river that might cross before attack commenced others agreed to wait until signal be given by major firing a soon a heard report of major rifle swinton alexander with party advanced to bank of river plunged in be soon up to horse girth with reed far above head must hear animal forcing way through reed must not see after severe labor swinton said alexander will be prudent for to go back can hing here will stand chance of being shot by own people who can not see must leave dog to drive out hottentot bushman must regain bank just a swinton said loud rushing be heard through reed look out cried must say no more before reed opened large hippopotamus rushed upon throwing over alexander horse on side treading alexander horse deep under water a passed over disappeared although water be not more than four foot in depth be with difficulty that horse rider must extricate from reed among have be jammed entangled alexander breath be quite gone when at last emerged bremen swinton hastened to give what assistance must horse be once more on leg rifle cried alexander be in water will find said swinton haste up to bank a fast a can for be defenseless alexander thought advisable to follow swinton advice with difficulty regained bank where be soon afterward followed by swinton bremen who have secured rifle alexander called omrah sent to caravan for rifle then for first time exclaimed oh what brute be lucky water be deep must have jammed on head so never must have risen up again have indeed have providential escape alexander replied swinton be horse hurt must be must think said alexander for animal trod upon doe not appear to show at present in mean time several shot be fired from opposite side of river by major party occasionally head horn of buffalo be seen above reed by hottentot who remained with swinton alexander animal still adhered to cover omrah having brought rifle bremen then proposed that hottentot bushman dog must force way through reed attempt to drive animal out in there must be no danger a animal must not charge with effect in deep water thick rush provided meet with hippopotamus said alexander laughing wo say word about sir replied bremen who then went gave direction illustration alexander hippopotamus hottentot bushman accompanied by dog then went into reed shouting barking soon drove out of buffalo on opposite side report of gun be heard at last one came out on side of river where alexander swinton be watching swinton fired animal fell on knee shot from alexander brought down dead turned on side one of bushman ran up to carcass be about to use knife when buffalo charged from reed caught bushman on horn threw many yard in air bushman fell among reed behind buffalo in vain looked about for enemy when shot from bremen brought to ground shortly afterward bushman made appearance from reed be not at hurt with exception of graze from horn of animal contusion of rib chase now became warm shouting of hottentot barking of dog bellowing of herd be forcing way through reed before be very exciting by advice of swinton took up position on higher ground where horse have good footing in case buffalo must charge a soon a arrived there beheld scene on other side of river about one hundred yard from filled with anxiety terror major horse be galloping away major not to be seen under large tree swanevelt be in sitting posture holding hand to body a if severely wounded horse lying by side right before enormous bull buffalo standing blood be streaming from animal nostril be evidently tottering from weakness loss of blood at last fell fear there be mischief done cried swinton where can major be two hottentot who be with swanevelt be hurt horse killed be evident have better call off let buffalo remain quiet escape a please there be major said alexander hottentot too be not hurt see be up tree thank god now observed major run up to swanevelt presently two hottentot went in pursuit of major horse shortly afterward swanevelt with assistance of major got upon leg taking up gun walked slowly away great harm done after said alexander god be praised here come whole herd swinton let go good fellow replied swinton have have enough of buffalo hunting for present whole herd have now broken from reed about fifty pace from where be stationed with tail raised tossing with horn bellowing with rage fear darted out of reed dripping with slime mud rushed off toward forest in few second be out of sight good riddance said swinton hope major be now satisfied with buffalo hunting be at event replied alexander feel very sore stiff what narrow escape that bushman have have indeed alexander horse be not well can hardly breathe have better dismount alexander did so unloosed girth bremen got off horse offering to alexander took bridle of other examined have rib broken sir said hottentot two of if not more wonder poor fellow lead gently bremen oh here come major now will know what have occurred there be swanevelt two men well major pray tell adventure for have frightened dreadfully not half so much a have be frightened replied major have have narrow escape can assure swanevelt horse be dead be swanevelt hurt be most miraculously preserved horn of buffalo have grazed whole length of body yet not injured let go to caravan have something to drink then will tell about be quite done up tongue cleaves to roof of mouth a soon a have arrived at caravan dismounted major drank water then gave narrative have several shot on side of river for buffalo have evidently intention of crossing over have not turned have killed two when bull buffalo charged from reed upon swanevelt before must turn horse put to speed horn of buffalo have ripped up poor animal fell with swanevelt under enraged brute disengaged from horse made second charge upon swanevelt twisted on one side horn only grazed a have mentioned then fired wounded animal charged immediately turned horse from fright wheeled so suddenly that lost stirrup saddle turned round found must not recover seat be gradually sliding under horse belly when passed under tree caught branch swung on to just a buffalo be close behind came up to a passed under back hit leg so may imagine be 'touch go ' animal perceiving that horse left be not on quitted pursuit came back bellowing roaring looking everywhere for at last perceived swanevelt who have disengaged from dead horse be sitting under tree apparently much hurt a be poor fellow although not seriously immediately turned back to must certainly have gored to death have not kloet who be up in tree fired at animal wounded mortally for career be stopped a charged toward swanevelt be not ten yard from animal must proceed further there stood until fell dead saw portion of adventure ourselves major said swinton now will tell own have be equally full of incident danger swinton having related what have passed on side of river major observed may talk about lion 'd rather go to ten lion hunt than one more buffalo hunt have have enough of buffalo for life be glad to hear say so replied swinton for be most ferocious dangerous animal a may now acknowledge difficulty of giving mortal wound render attack of very hazardous have seen heard enough of buffalo hunting to tell that have be fortunate although have lost one horse have very much hurt here come spoil of chase at event will benefit by day sport have good meal ca eat now said alexander be very stiff will go lie down for hour two so will said major have appetite well then will meet at supper said swinton in mean time will see if can be of use to swanevelt where omrah saw begum going out together just now said major what for know oh told to get of bushman root said alexander be a good a potato when boiled have taken monkey to find major alexander remained on bed till supper time when mahomed woke up found much refreshed by sleep also found that appetite have returned buffalo steak fried bushman root be declared to be very good substitute for beefsteak fried potato after have made hearty meal alexander inquired of swinton what have seen of buffalo hunting when have be at cape before have only be once twice engaged in buffalo hunt can tell have heard what have collected from own knowledge a to nature of animal of indeed to day have have very good proof told morning that single buffalo be more dangerous than herd reason be at breeding season fiercest bull drive others away from herd in same manner a elephant do solitary buffalo be extremely dangerous a wait to be attacked will attack man without provocation generally conceal rush out upon unawares make more difficult to escape from be so bold that fear lion have be told by dutch boor that when buffalo have killed one of comrade by goring tossing will not leave victim for hour continue to trample on with hoof crushing body with knee a elephant doe with rough tongue stripping off skin a far a can doe not do at one time leaf body return again a if to glut vengeance what malicious brute such be certainly character recollect history of buffalo hunting adventure told by dutch farmer who be eye witness to scene have gone out with party to hunt herd of buffalo be grazing on piece of marshy ground sprinkled with few mimosa tree a must not get within shot of herd without crossing portion of marsh be not safe for horse agreed to leave steed in charge of two hottentot to advance on foot thinking that in case of buffalo must charge must be easy to escape by running back to marsh must bear weight of man not of horse much le that of buffalo advanced accordingly over marsh being concealed by bush have good fortune to bring down with first volley three of fattest of herd also so severely wounded great bull be leader of herd that dropped down on knee bellowing most furiously thinking that animal be mortally wounded foremost of huntsman walked out in front of bush from have fired began to reload musket a advanced in order to give animal finishing shot sooner did enraged animal see man advancing than sprang up charged headlong at man threw down gun ran toward marsh beast be so close upon that despaired of escaping by direction turning suddenly round clump of copsewood began to climb old mimosa tree stood close to buffalo be however too quick for bounding forward with roar farmer told be one of most hideous appalling sound that ever heard caught poor fellow with terrible horn just a have nearly got out of reach tossed in air with such force after whirling round round to great height body fell into fork of branch of tree buffalo went round tree roaring looking for man until exhausted by wound loss of blood again fell down on knee other hunter then attacked killed found comrade who be still hanging in tree quite dead well have doubt that such must have be fate of swanevelt of have brute got hold of said major never saw such malignant diabolical expression in animal countenance a there be upon buffalo lion be must say gentleman man of honor compared to evil disposed ruffian well major have only to let alone recollect be aggressor said swinton laughing very true never wish to see one again never wish to be in way of hippopotamus again can assure said alexander for greater want of politeness never met with during conversation hottentot bushman at other fire have not be idle hottentot have fried eaten fried eaten till must hold more bushman who in morning looked a thin meager a if have not have meal for month be now so stuffed that must hardly walk lean stomach be distended a round a ball bushman who have be tossed by buffalo came up asked for little tobacco at same time smiling patting stomach be distended to most extraordinary size yes let give said alexander will complete day happiness did ever see fellow so stuffed wonder doe not burst be custom starve for day then gorge in way when opportunity offer be seldom calendar such a be be mainly from recollection of feasting will answer for that if one bushman be on future day to ask when thing took place must reply just before just after white men killed buffalo how do live in general live upon root at certain season of year upon locust when flight take place upon lizard beetle thing occasionally procure game not very often be obliged to lie in wait for wound with poisoned arrow then follow track look for next day subtle a poison be only cut out part near wound eat rest of animal dig pit hole for hippopotamus rhinoceros occasionally take poison pool for game also living be very precarious often suffer extremity of hunger be that cause do imagine of being so diminutive race swinton doubt of continual privation hardship from generation to generation have have doubt dwindled down to what see how be that bushman be so familiar thought that be savage irreclaimable be what be termed tame bushman be have lived near farmer have by degree become le afraid of european treated kindly have done good in return to farmer by watching sheep performing other little service have be rewarded with tobacco have given confidence to certain degree must expect to meet with others be equally wild who will be very mischievous attempting to drive off cattle watching in ambush round caravan ready for pilfering that can successfully accomplish then will discover that be in haunt without even seeing how so because will only be by theft that will find out be time for bed a to morrow be sunday will have day of rest think require do replied alexander so good night to chapter xxii a arranged did not travel on sunday early in morning ox horse sheep be turned out to pasture except horse have be ridden by alexander on preceding day be found to be suffering so much that took away large quantity of blood from before be relieved bushman still remained with be likely to do so a long a there be prospect of food four buffalo have be killed a well a horse have be gored to death be found picked clean to bone on following day by hyena other animal be heard prowling during whole night a large quantity of buffalo flesh have be cut off hung upon tree near caravan there be more than sufficient for second feast for bushman hottentot there be nothing frying roasting during whole of day sun be intensely hot alexander major felt so fatigued from exertion of day before after breakfast retired to wagon swinton did not attempt to disturb a be in sound sleep till evening when be much refreshed very hungry swinton said have thought better that must not be awakened a heat be so overpowering must perform divine service in evening if thought proper when must be cooler be agreed to after early supper summoned hottentot who although gorged be still unwilling to leave fire a said bushman must devour flesh be left in absence remonstrance be not listened to assembled prayer be read service gone through by light of large fire for be very dark before service be finished bushman a hottentot prophesied have taken advantage of absence to help very liberally a swinton read prayer eye of hottentot be continually turning round to own fire where bushman be throwing on large piece of buffalo flesh before be even heated through be chewing tearing to piece with teeth never perhaps be there congregation whose attention be so divided who be more anxious for conclusion of service uneasiness shown by hottentot appeared at last to be communicated to ox be tied up round wagon fire required replenishing none of hottentot moved to perform office perhaps thought that if swinton must no longer see service must conclude swinton knew by heart continued reading commandment be last portion read alexander major repeated response major whose face be toward cattle have observed uneasiness guessed cause did not like to interrupt service a be just over begum began clinging to in way always did when be afraid swinton have just finished major be saying swinton depend upon when roar like thunder be heard dark mass passed over head bellowing struggling of ox be almost instantaneously succeeded by lion with ox borne on shoulder passing right through whole congregation sweeping away remnant of fire hottentot right left vanishing in moment from sight a may be imagined be confusion alarm screamed shouted ran for gun be too late on examination be found that lion have seized ox have be tied up near to where be sitting fire being nearly extinguished one must have be kept alight next to altogether neglected by hottentot in anxiety to keep up on have be broiling buffalo steak leather thong by ox have be tied up be snapped like thread many of other ox have in agony of fear broken fastening escaped a lion bounded away through assembled party appeared a if ox be not feather weight to have however stepped rather roughly upon two of hottentot who lay groaning a if have be severely hurt upon examination be found that have only be well scratched covered with ash bushman however have left meal with bow small poisoned arrow have gone in pursuit bremen one two of hottentot proposed also to go traveler must not permit about hour afterward bushman returned have communication with through bremen learned that bushman have come up with lion about mile distant have discharged many of arrow at be convinced with effect a heavy growl angry roar be announcement when be hit although be irritated continued repast omrah then said lion dead to morrow bushman find well said alexander a went to wagon in consequence of event having to make up large fire before went to bed did not do till late believe be first time divine service be ever wound up by such intrusion perhaps so replied swinton think prof that have more cause for prayer surrounded a be by such danger lion might have taken one of by time must have suffered horrid death never felt full force of many simile comparison in scripture where lion be so often introduced till now observed alexander be indeed most awful sermon after prayer said major trust never to hear one again be not own fault be second time that one of ox have be carried off by lion from circle of fire not being properly attended to be neglect of hottentot certainly if be so neglectful must attend to will be a well to punish for neglect said swinton by stopping tobacco for week for if find that attend to fire ourselves will not keep one in may depend upon however will discus point to morrow so good night omrah came to major next morning before ox be yoked to say that bushman have found lion that be not yet dead nearly so that animal have dragged away portion of ox that did not eat about mile further that there have lain down be so sick that must not move at intelligence mounted horse guided by bushman arrived at bush where lion lay bushman entered at once for have previously reconnoitered be saluted with low snarl very different from roar of preceding night traveler followed found noble creature in last agony strength paralyzed eye closed one two of small arrow of bushman be still sticking in hide did not appear to have entered more than inch poison be so subtle that have rapidly circulated through whole frame while be looking down upon noble beast dropped jaw expired a traveler turned back to join caravan alexander observed bushman diminutive a be in size contemptible a weapon appear must be dangerous enemy when mere prick of one of small arrow be certain death what be poison composed of of venom extracted from snake be mixed up with juice of euphorbia boiled down till becomes of consistency of glue then dip head of arrow into let dry on be then venom of snake so active after have be taken away from animal yes for considerable time after remember story be believe well authenticated of man who have be bitten through boot by rattlesnake in america man died shortly afterward two son died one after other with just same symptom a father although have not be bitten by snake be afterward discovered that upon father death son have one after other taken possession of put on boot boot being examined fang of rattlesnake be discovered to have passed through leather remained there fang have merely grazed skin of two son when put on boot have thus caused death be snake here a deadly in poison a rattlesnake of america equally so that be two three of be most formidable be cobra capella not same a indian snake of same name be very large being usually five foot long have be found six even seven foot snake have be known to dart at man on horseback with such force a to overshoot aim bite be certain death believe a never heard of man recovering from wound well be a bad a can be what be next next be what call puff adder be very heavy sluggish animal very thick in proportion to length when attacked in front can not make spring have however power if be not prepared for be perhaps equally dangerous that of throwing backward in most surprising manner be however only when trod upon provoked bite be very deadly then two of mountain adder be among most dangerous snake here mountain adder be small from not being so easily seen so easily avoided be very dangerous bite a fatal a others trust be end of catalogue not exactly there be have specimen of whose faculty have never seen put to test be called spirting snake be about three foot long bite although poisonous be not fatal have faculty from name be derived of spirting venom into face of assailant if venom enters eye at animal dart immediate blindness ensues there be great many other variety of have obtained possession of during journey many of be venomous not so fatal a first three have mentioned indeed be great blessing that almighty have not made variety of snake aggressive fierce be not provided a be with such dreadful power if be so must indeed be formidable only act in self defense when provoked may a well here observe that hottentot when kill of dangerous snake invariably cut off head bury do that one may by chance tread upon a assert that poison of fang be a potent a ever not only for week month afterward certainly be corroboration of story that told of rattlesnake fang in boot be so although there be so many venomous snake in country be remarkable how very few accident death occur from made inquiry at moravian mission where venomous snake be very plentiful how many people have lost by bite missionary told that out of hottentot belonging to mission have only lost two men by bite of snake during space of seven year in other place where made same inquiry casualty be much le in proportion to number be boa constrictor found in part of africa not so far south a now be be few degree more to northward have never seen believe there be doubt of existence south american indian have very subtle poison with kill game be aware swinton of nature be like bushman poison know poison well be brought over by mr waterton whose amusing work may have read be called wourali poison be said to be extracted from sort of creeping vine grows in country native however add poison of snake to extract preparation be certainly very fatal a can bear witness to have ever seen tried yes have tried when be in italy became acquainted with mr w gave two three of who be living together small quantity not much more than two grain of mustard seed in size purchased young mule to make experiment upon incision be made in shoulder poison inserted under skin think in about six seven minute animal be dead mr w said that effect must have be instantaneous if virtue of poison have not somewhat deteriorated from having be kept so long wourali poison only act upon nerve believe said major only upon nerve although so fatal if immediate mean be resorted to person who be apparently dead from may be brought to life again by same process a be usual in recovery of drowned suffocated people donkey upon poison have acted be restored in manner for remainder of day permitted to run in sir joseph bank park poison of snake act upon blood therefore occasion death without remedy there be remedy believe for even most fatal poison yes in provident mercy god have be pleased to furnish remedy at hand where snake exists remedy be to be found rattlesnake root be cure if taken applied immediately be well known that ichneumon when bitten by cobra capella in attack upon will hasten to particular herb eat immediately to prevent fatal effect of animal bite once saw native of india said major who for small sum must allow to be bitten by cobra capella be well provided with same plant used by ichneumon swallowed plentifully also rubbed on wound be impossible to say so far a must judge there be deception think very possible if plant will cure ichneumon why not man have doubt that there be many plant posse virtue of have knowledge few perhaps of most valuable have discovered knowledge of vegetable kingdom a far a medicinal property be known be very slight perhaps many be formerly known have since introduction of mineral antidote be lost sight of why yes long before chemistry have made advance do hear in old romance of balsam of most sovereign virtue said alexander laughing may observe be almost proof that did in reality exist more so because will find that knowledge of sovereign remedy be chiefly in hand of jew oldest nation upon earth from constant communication with other most likely to have transmitted knowledge from generation to generation have also reason to believe that not only have peculiar remedy in time also if be to credit what have be handed down to that art of poisoning be much better understood said major at event have not knowledge of chemistry now lead to immediate detection replied swinton alexander there be three hippopotamus lying asleep on side of river have mind to try skill not particularly replied alexander have have enough of hippopotamus by by river be much wider than be yes by calculation ought to travel more to westward after to day must now cut across to yellow val river will certainly be two day without water pasturage for cattle be in such good condition that will not much feel there be river will cross near head chance of water be very small indeed believe will find nowhere except in great artery if may so call well be thinking so myself swinton a looked at map yesterday when lay in wagon said major so then to morrow for little variety be desert will most certainly be replied swinton for except on bank of large river there be hope of vegetation in country at season of year in month may expect heavy fall of rain bushman have left perceive said alexander yes have probably remained behind to eat lion what will eat now that have be poisoned that make difference to merely cut out part wounded invariably eat carcass of animal kill apparently without injury there be nothing bushman will not eat flight of locust be great feast to can not imagine to be very palatable food have never tasted replied swinton must think not however eat raw pull off wing leg dry body then beat into powder do suppose that st john fare of locust wild honey be locust be now referring to know must rather think not for one reason be that although person in wilderness might subsist upon animal if always to be procured yet flight of locust be very uncertain now there be tree in country where st john retired be called locust tree produce large sweet bean shaped like common french bean nearly foot long be very palatable nutritious be even now given to cattle in large quantity imagine that be locust referred to believe many of commentator on holy writing have be of same opinion think have now gone far enough for to day may a well halt there do intend to hunt major see animal there at distance must say not said alexander if be to cross desert tract to morrow have better not fatigue horse certainly not swinton will remain quiet unless game come to yes look after water keg being filled fire lighted to night said alexander trust may have more sermon from lion although shakespeare doe say beermons from stone good in everything ' halted caravan upon rising ground having taken precaution to see water keg filled wood collected sat down to dinner upon fried ham cheese for hottentot have devoured buffalo flesh demanded sheep to be killed for supper be consented to although did not deserve a tobacco have be stopped for neglect of providing fuel keeping up fire be considered politic not to make too discontented alexander have be walking by side of river with major while hottentot be arranging camp swinton be putting away new specimen in natural history have collected when omrah who be with put finger to lip stopped a perfectly understood what required stood still silent omrah then pointed to something be lying on low bank under tuft of rush must not distinguish omrah asked by sign for major rifle took aim fired loud splashing be heard in water pushed way through high grass reed until arrived at spot where perceived animal floundering in agony of death alligator exclaimed major well have idea that there be here inland said that there be plenty at mouth of river on coast of eastern caffre be astonished to find one here what did fire at asked swinton who now joined alligator be dead be afraid that wo be very good eating replied major be not alligator major said swinton be very good eating be large lizard of guana specie be found about river be amphibious perfectly harmless subsisting upon vegetable insect tell be great delicacy ugly a look be quite dead so let drag out of water send up to mahomed by omrah animal be about four foot long be dragged out of water by tail omrah took to camp well really thought be small alligator said major now perceive mistake what variety of lizard there appears to be in country great many from chameleon upward replied swinton by by there be one be said to be very venomous have heard many well authenticated story of bite being not only very dangerous in instance fatal have specimen of animal in collection be called here geitje well be rather remarkable have in india small lizard called gecko by native be said to be equally venomous presume must be same animal be singular that name must vary so little have never seen instance of poisonous power have seen whole company of sepoys run out of quarter because have heard animal make usual cry in thatch of building say that drop down upon people from roof probably same animal strong corroboration that report of being venomous be with good foundation yet if be to make assertion in england must in probability not be believed not by many grant not by who only know little by who be well informed probably must be fact be from too ready credulity have now turned to almost total skepticism unless have ocular demonstration in time of marco polo sir john mandeville others say in fifteenth century when there be few traveler little education traveler might assert almost thing gain credence latterly traveler hardly dare assert thing le vaillant bruce who traveled in south north of africa be stigmatized a liar when published account of what have seen yet tittle have since be proved to be correct however a people be now better informed reject so positively for have certain rule to guide between possible impossible how do mean mean for instance that if person be to tell that have seen mermaid with body of woman scaly tail of fish must at once say must not believe why because be contrary to law of nature two component part of animal must not be combined a upper portion must belong to mammalia be hot blooded animal lower to cold blooded class of natural history junction must therefore be impossible there be have doubt many animal still undiscovered rather still unknown to european description of may at first excite suspicion if not doubt a have before observed account must in probability not be rejected by naturalist although might be by people without much knowledge of animal kingdom who must not be able to judge by comparison whether existence of such animal be credible even fabulous animal have have origin from existing one unicorn be doubt gemsbok antelope for when look at animal at distance two horn appear a if be only one bushman have so portrayed animal in cave dragon be also not exactly imaginary for lacerta volans flying lizard of northern africa be very like small dragon in miniature so even what have be considered a fabulous have arisen from exaggeration mistake think then swinton that be bound to believe traveler tell not so not to reject what assert merely because doe not correspond with own idea on subject most remarkable instance of unbelief be relative to aerolite meteoric

chief gave said 'whenever see lion moving in middle of day may be certain that be in great want of food very angry never attack one then for be very dangerous most desperate ' if therefore major wish very serious affair one two life lost will attack that animal must expect that what say will happen indeed dear swinton wish to lose own life to risk of others therefore will remain here till majesty have have time to get out of way hope may soon find dinner by time caravan have come up with then proceeded face of country became even more sterile at last not animal of description be to be seen a there be nothing for ox to feed upon continued route during whole of day at night halted secured cattle to wagon wood for fire be not able to procure therefore made one half of hottentot watch during night with musket to scare off wild beast a swinton observed there be little chance of being disturbed by lion other animal a be so distant from water there be game near upon wild beast prey so proved for during whole night did not even hear cry of hyena jackal at first gleaming of light ox be again yoked with hope of being able to gain val river by night relay ox be now put to to relieve appeared

then what be to be done said major will fire do think that have possession of boy if have will let go yes be too numerous for now will not show fight depend upon let take good aim fire volley right into well then will take venerable old chap appears to be leader great grandfather of said major be ready then fire volley have effect three four of animal be killed many be wounded whole herd went scampering off with loud shriek cry wounded trailing after others a well a must whole party then ascended crag to look after omrah begum who must not venture have hardly gained summit when heard voice below must not see there be sir said swanevelt down below there swinton major went down again at last guided by shout of boy came to narrow cleft in rock about twenty foot deep at bottom of heard must not see boy cleft be so narrow that none of men must squeeze down swinton sent one of back for leathern thong piece of rope to let down to during delay bremen inquired of omrah if be hurt received answer in negative when rope came be lowered down to omrah seized be hauled up by hottentot appeared to have suffered little a hair be torn out in large handful shirt be in ribbon with exception of severe scratch from nail of baboon have serious injury omrah explained to hottentot who must talk language begum have come to cleft have discovered that there be water at bottom of that begum have gone down that be following when baboon drank in chasm have come upon begum have sprung up escaped must not that animal have followed down until be so jammed in cleft that must descend further that there have pulled out hair torn shirt a saw having heard omrah story satisfied that have received no serious injury then went to where baboon have be shot two be dead old one major have fired at be alive although severely wounded having received two shot one in arm other in leg be broken by ball poor old creature fierceness appeared to have left be evidently very weak from loss of blood sat down leaning against rock now then must raise look down upon wound in leg examining hole where bullet have passed through then must hold up wounded arm with other hand look in face inquiringly a much a to say what have done for poor creature said alexander how much motion be of human being mute expostulation be quite painful to witness very true said major still if have not wound must tear to piece if must that certainly must said swinton still be object of pity can not recover have better put out of misery desiring bremen to shoot animal through head traveler then walked back to caravan a returned by bank of river perceived begum very busy scraping up baked mud at bottom of pool what be princess about said alexander know cried omrah who immediately ran to assistance of baboon after little more scraping pulled out live tortoise about foot long have heard that when pool dry up tortoise remain in mud till pool be filled up again said swinton be good eating swinton excellent turtle soup in desert be something unexpected hottentot now set to work discovered five six more brought out then tried in vain to get at water in deep cleft finding impossible caravan continued course how much more of desert have to traverse said alexander before come to river illustration tortoise discovery fear that will not arrive there before to morrow night said swinton unless travel on during night think will be best plan for fatiguing a will be to animal will be even more exhausted if pas day under sun without water at night will bear work better gain nothing by stopping a longer be on journey more will be exhausted be really fearful for horse suffer so much at night will wash mouth with sponge full of water can spare so much for poor creature in desert of africa have always one of three danger

yoked continued course by star horse have be refreshed a swinton have proposed be too much exhausted to be ridden traveler with gun on shoulder dog loose to give notice of danger now walked by side of wagon over sandy ground star shone out brilliantly even tired cattle felt relief from comparative coolness of night air be silent except creaking of wheel of wagon occasional sigh of exhausted ox a thus passed through desert well observed major after have walked about hour without speaking know what thought may have be while have occurred to that party of pleasure may be carried to too great length think have be very selfish in persuading wilmot to undergo that have undergone be likely to undergo merely because wished to shoot giraffe presume must plead guilty also replied swinton in having assisted to induce know naturalist be so ardent in pursuit that think of nothing else think that have of much to answer for replied alexander be just a anxious to go a be a far a be concerned

evening before a arrived at river bank be saluted with lively note of bird hymning forth morning praise found cattle after slaking thirst be now quietly feeding upon luxuriant grass surrounded well may psalmist prophet talk of beauty of flowing river said alexander now feel truth beauty of language one must almost imagine that sacred writing be indited in wild if not in certainly be in eastern country assimilate strongly with said swinton a truly say be only by having passed through country that can fully appreciate beauty never know real value of thing till have felt what be to be deprived of in temperate climate with pump in house people can not truly estimate value of 'flowing river hottentot having now arrived cattle be driven back to wagon yoked that might be brought up to spot have be selected for encampment in mean time traveler who be tired with night walk lay down under large mimosa tree close to bank of river will stay here day two of course said major yes for sake of cattle

to reconnoiter found profusion of game in large plain about two mile distant be decided that must rest where be for day two if game be not frightened away river have be crossed by swanevelt who stated that there be large herd of elephant on other side track of rhinoceros be to be seen on side of river on third morning after arrival at val set off accompanied by hottentot to plain have spoken of riding through magnificent group of acacia camelthorn tree many of be covered with enormous nest of social grosbeak a descended to plain perceived large herd of brindled gnoos quagga antelope covering whole face of country a far a eye must reach moving about in mass to fro joining other separating so that whole plain seemed alive with be not splendid cried major such sight be worth trouble labor

swinton one of most elegant of antelope tribe red yellow out there be harte beests wish to have male female specimen of if can see said major there be fine flock of ostrich be puzzled where to begin come have surveyed scene long enough now forward to change rode down be soon within shot of animal rifle began work hottentot commenced firing from various point alarmed by report of gun animal now fled away in direction whole place be one cloud of dust traveler put horse to speed soon came up with again a number impeded animal in flight shot told for be hardly possible to miss hottentot who followed on foot put who be wounded out of misery at last horse be too fatigued too much out of wind to continue pursuit reined up well alexander have be sport have not said major yes grand battue on grand scale indeed there be three animal did not observe said swinton be impossible to get at be so far off must try for time what be eland largest of antelope tribe replied swinton best eating of sometimes be nineteen hand high at chest will weigh nearly lb have head of antelope body be more like of ox have magnificent straight horn be not dangerous be easily run down for generally speaking be very fat incapable of much exertion will look out for to morrow said major see how vulture be hovering over know there will be bone for to pick night more than bone replied alexander for what can do with so many carcass there be provision for month if must keep what prodigious variety of animal there appears to be in country yes be congregated here because country from want of rain may be considered a barren within eight nine degree of latitude from cape find largest most minute of creation have ostrich little creeper among bird among beast have elephant weighing lb black specked mouse

hippopotamus certainly have bulkiest animal in existence bremen now came up to say that have discovered rhinoceros close to river side concealed in bush underneath clump of acacia major alexander having declared intention of immediately going in pursuit swinton advised to be cautious a charge of rhinoceros be very awkward affair if did not get out of way rode down to clump of tree bush where animal be said to be hid by advice of bremen sent for dog to worry animal out bremen who be on foot be desired by major to take horse omrah rode that might be more expeditious traveler remained with clear space of two hundred yard between bush where animal be concealed hottentot have also followed be ordered on account to fire till have taken position dog be sent in to drive animal out when bremen be short distance from with dog swinton advised that must dismount take possession of small clump of tree grew very close together a must be concealed from animal called omrah to take horse be not to be seen so gave to one of hottentot to lead to distance out of harm way vision of rhinoceros be so limited observed swinton that be not difficult to get out of way on first charge at second be generally prepared for maneuver ball in shoulder be most fatal look out bremen have turned in dog barking of dog commenced a soon a entered bush did not continue more than minute when female rhinoceros of black variety burst out of thicket in pursuit of retreating dog several shot be fired by hottentot who be concealed in different quarter without effect animal rushing along tearing up ground with horn looking out for enemy at last perceived hottentot who showed from bush near to where traveler be concealed animal charged immediately in charging be brought down on knee by shot from alexander hottentot rushed out regardless of swinton calling out to to be careful a animal be not dead have surrounded within few yard when rose again fiercely charged swanevelt who narrowly escaped shot from major put end to career then walked to where animal lay when cry from omrah who be standing near river attracted notice perceived that male rhinoceros of whose presence be not aware have just burst out of same covert be charging toward one immediately took to heel many of hottentot in fear dropping musket fortunately distance be from covert gave time to conceal in thicket before animal have time to come up with shot from swinton turned assailant who now tore up earth in rage looking everywhere round with sharp flashing eye for victim at moment while seemed hesitating peering about to astonishment of whole party omrah showed openly on other side of rhinoceros waving red handkerchief have taken off head rhinoceros moment that boy caught eye rushed furiously toward boy lost cried swinton hardly have word gone from mouth when to astonishment rhinoceros disappeared omrah stood capering shouting with fact be that omrah when have left traveler have gone down toward river a went along have with light weight passed over what knew full well to be one of deep pit dug by bushman to catch animal having fully satisfied that be so have remained by side of when rhinoceros rushed at have kept pit between animal object be to induce animal to charge at did when within four yard of lad have plunged into pit dug for success of omrah plan explained whole matter at once traveler hastened up to where rhinoceros be impounded found that large stake fixed upright in center of pit have impaled animal shot from major put end to fury agony of animal never be more excited in life thought boy be mad wanted to lose life said alexander so did replied swinton yet ought to have known better be admirably done here have instance of superiority of man endowed with reasoning power over brute rhinoceros will destroy elephant lion can make impression on fly before like cat be in fact most powerful of animal fear enemy not even man when be provoked wounded yet have fallen by cleverness of little monkey of bushboy think major have done enough now may go back to caravan yes be well satisfied with day sport be not little hungry may now let hottentot bring home a much game a can have taken care to give direction about specimen swinton yes bremen know animal require be now after omrah run tell fellow to bring horse here swinton can bird beast talk can not said major ask that question because be now looking at enormous nest of grosbeak be regular town with hundred of house bird a well a sagacious animal beaver ant bee not to mention variety of others must have way of communicating idea that there be doubt of replied swinton laughing still believe that man only be endowed with speech well know if not with speech must have mean of communication answer a well a far a want require doubt replied swinton to what extent be hidden from animal have instinct reasoning power not reason where be difference reasoning power be generally limited to necessity with animal who be companion of man appear to be more extended have grand supper to night said alexander what will help to harte beest sassaby rhinoceros thank replied major laughing will trouble for small piece of rhinoceros steak underdone if please how curious must sound in grosvenor square not if shot animal in richmond park said rascally hottentot will collect fuel to night if make do now said major if once begin to stuff will be over with very true have better set about before feast begin call bremen omrah having given direction party finished supper then alexander asked swinton whether have ever known serious accident resulting from hunting of rhinoceros yes replied swinton once be witness to death of native chief then pray tell story said major by hearing how other people have suffered learn how to take care of ourselves before do so will mention what be told by namaqua chief about lion be reminded of by major observation a to mean animal have of communicating with other once when be traveling in namaqua land observed spot be imprinted with at least twenty spoor mark of lion paw a pointed out namaqua chief told that lion have be practicing leap on demanding explanation said that if lion sprang at animal missed by leaping short must always go back to where sprang from practice leap so a to be successful on occasion then related to following anecdote stating that be eye witness to incident be passing near end of craggy hill from jutted out smooth rock of from ten to twelve foot high when perceived number of zebra galloping round be obliged to do a rock beyond be quite steep lion be creeping toward rock to catch male zebra brought up rear of herd lion sprang missed mark fell short with only head over edge of rock zebra galloped away switching tail in air although object of pursuit be gone lion tried leap on rock second third time till succeeded during two more lion came up joined first lion seemed to be talking for roared great deal to other then first lion led round rock again again then made grand leap to show what must do time ' chief added 'they evidently be talking to other must not understand word of what said although talked loud enough thought be a well to be off might have talk about ' well certainly whisper said major laughing thank for story swinton now for rhinoceros hunt be once out hunting with griqua of name of henrick two three other men have wounded springbok be following track when came upon footing of rhinoceros shortly afterward saw large black male in bush mention black rhinoceros be there other yes there be white rhinoceros a be called larger than black not so dangerous be in fact stupid sort of animal black rhinoceros a be aware be very fierce well to continue henrick slipped down behind bush fired wounded animal severely in foreleg rhinoceros charged fled animal singling out one of men closely pursued man stopping short while horn of rhinoceros plowed up ground at heel dexterously jumped on one side rhinoceros missed passed on in full speed before brute must recover change course whole of have climbed up into tree rhinoceros limping with wound went round round trying to find out by scent tried in vain at last one of men who have only assaguay said how long be going to stay here why shoot ' 'well said henrick 'if be so anxious to shoot may if please here be powder shot belt gun lie under tree man immediately descended from tree loaded gun approaching rhinoceros fired wounded severely in jaw animal be stunned dropped on spot thinking that be dead descended fearlessly collected round man who have fired be very proud be giving direction to others when of sudden animal began to recover kicked with hind leg henrick told to run for life set example rhinoceros started up again singling out unfortunate man who have got down fired at roaring snorting with rage thundered after man perceiving that must not outrun beast tried same plan a other hunter did when rhinoceros charged stopping short jumped on one side that animal might pas brute be not to be balked second time caught man on horn under left thigh cutting open a if have be done with ax tossed dozen yard up in air poor fellow fell facing rhinoceros with leg spread beast rushed at again ripped up body from stomach to almost throat again tossed in air again fell heavily to ground rhinoceros watched fall running up to trod upon pounded to mummy after horrible tragedy beast limped off into bush henrick then crept up to bush animal dashed out again must certainly have killed man if dog have not turned in turning short round upon dog bone of fore leg have be half broken through by henrick first shot snapped in two fell unable to recover be then shot dead very awkward customer at event observed major presume leaden bullet must not enter must flatten against most part of body by by saw instance of rhinoceros having be destroyed by cowardly brute hyena indeed yes patience perseverance on hyena part effected work rhinoceros take long while to turn round hyena attacked behind biting with powerful jaw above joint of hind leg continued so to do till have severed muscle animal forced from pain to lie down be devoured a may say alive from behind hyena still tearing at same quarter until arrived at vital part by track be marked by blood of rhinoceros hyena must have followed animal for many mile until rhinoceros be in such pain that must proceed further if be to hunt to morrow at daybreak be time to go to sleep so good night at daybreak next morning took hasty meal started again for plain swinton having to prepare specimen did not accompany there be heavy fog on plain when arrived at waited for short time skirting south side of with view of drawing animal toward encampment at last fog vanished discovered whole country a before covered with variety of wild animal a object be to obtain eland antelope remained stationary for time seeking for animal among variety be scattered in direction at last omrah whose eye be far keener than even hottentot pointed out three at distance under large acacia thorn immediately rode at trot in direction various herd of quagga gnoos antelope scoured away before so numerous be such be clattering of hoof that might have imagined that be heavy charge of cavalry object of pursuit remained quiet until be within three hundred yard of then set off at speed notwithstanding heavy unwieldy appearance for short time completely distanced horse speed must not be continued major alexander soon found rapidly coming up poor animal exerted in vain sleek coat first turned to blue color then white with foam perspiration at last be beaten to stand still be brought down by rifle of traveler who then dismounted horse walked up to quarry what magnificent animal exclaimed alexander be enormous certainly said major look at beautiful dying eye of noble beast be not speaking yes imploring for mercy a be poor creature well three beast that say be such good eating weigh more than fifty antelope more than fifty springbok grant well what will do now let horse get wind again then will see if can fall in with new game saw two three antelope of very different sort from sassaby harte beests toward rising ground will go way a soon a hottentot come up take charge of game doe swinton want to preserve one of creature believe not be so very bulky say will find plenty a go on that will not encumber wagon with skin until leave val river turn homeward now bremen omrah come with major alexander then turned horse head rode slowly toward hill have noticed antelope major have observed be now seen among bush crowned hill bremen said that did not know animal major be most anxious to obtain one to surprise swinton with a soon a came within two hundred yard of bush on other side of antelope be seen major gave horse to omrah advanced alone very cautiously that might bring one down with rifle gained bush without alarming animal party left behind be anxiously watching motion expecting moment to fire when major suddenly turned round came back at hurried pace what be matter said alexander matter enough to stop growth for life replied major if ever heart be in mouth be just now be advancing softly step by step toward antelope be just raising rifle to fire when heard something flapping ground three four yard before looked down be tail of lioness fortunately be so busy watching antelope with head other way that did not perceive being near whereupon beat retreat a have witnessed well what will do now wait little till have recovered nerve said major then will be revenged upon swinton be not here to preach prudence have lion hunt will with heart replied alexander bremen be going to attack lioness yes sir said bremen then have better follow cape fashion will back horse toward omrah will hold while will attack think one only have better fire so keep two gun in reserve be right bremen said alexander then will reserve fire major will try rifle upon with difficulty horse be backed toward bush until major must again distinguish where lioness lay at about sixty pace distance animal appeared still occupied with game in front of watching opportunity to spring for tail hind quarter be toward major fired animal bounded off with loud roar while antelope flew away like wind roar of lioness be answered by deep growl from part of bush immediately afterward lion bolted out bounded from bush across plain to small mimosa grove about quarter of mile off what splendid animal said alexander look at black mane almost sweep ground must have cried major jumping on horse alexander bremen omrah did same followed lion stood at bay under mimosa measuring strength of party facing in most noble imposing manner appeared however that did not like appearance be not satisfied with own position for a advanced retreated at slow pace took up position on summit of stony hill close by front of be thickly dotted with low thorn bush thorn bush extended about yard from where lion stood disdainfully surveying party a approached toward appearing with conscious pride in own power to dare to approach dismounted from horse a soon a arrived at thorn bush major fired rifle ball struck rock close to lion who replied with angry growl major then took gun from omrah fired again ball struck close to animal foot lion now shook mane gave angry roar by glistening of eye impatient switching of tail be evident that must soon become attacking party load gun again said alexander then let have shot major a soon a major gun be loaded alexander took aim fired shot broke lion fore leg raised up with voice of thunder made spring from rock toward where party stood steady now cried major to bremen at same time handing spare rifle to alexander rush of angry animal be heard through bush advancing nearer nearer stood prepared for encounter at last out animal sprang mane bristling on end tail straight out eyeball flashing rage vengeance came down upon hind quarter of one of horse immediately started off overthrowing dragging omrah to distance one of lion leg being broken have occasioned animal to roll off on side of horse now remained on ground ready for second spring when received shot through back from bremen who stood behind lion with dreadful roar attempted to spring upon major who be ready with rifle to receive shot from bremen have passed through spine paralyzed hind quarter made attempt in vain second third time throwing fore quarter up in air then falling down again when bullet from major passed through brain noble beast sunk down gnawing ground tearing with claw of leg have not be wounded then in few second breathed last be glad be over alexander said major be almost too exciting to be pleasant be very awful for time must acknowledge replied alexander what enormous brute think never saw such magnificent skin be yours by law of war said major nay replied alexander be that gave coup de grace yes if have not broken leg might have given of coup de grace skin be yours now horse be off can not send for hottentot have got rid of omrah who be coming back with shirt torn into tatter men will catch horse bring here depend upon sir said bremen then can take off skin well if be to have lion skin must have of lioness also major so must finish day hunting with forcing to join mate very good with heart better till men come with horse sir said bremen three gun be too few to attack lion very great danger indeed bremen be right alexander must not run risk again depend upon if animal leg have not be broken must not have have so easy conquest let sit down quietly till men come up in about hour a bremen have conjectured hottentot perceiving horse loose suspecting that something have happened went in chase of a soon a have succeeded in catching brought in direction to have seen traveler ride be not little astonished at so small party having ventured to attack lion gladly prepared for attack of lioness three of dog having accompanied be decided that must be put into bush where lioness be lying when major fired at so a to discover where now be leaving lion for present set off for first jungle dog must not find lioness in bush be evident that have retreated to other place swanevelt who be old lion hunter gave opinion that must be found in direction near to where lion be killed went therefore in direction found that be in clump of mimosa to lion have first retreated previous arrangement of backing horse toward where lay be attempted animal have be too much frightened in morning by lion attack to be persuaded reared plunged in such manner a to be with difficulty prevented from breaking loose be therefore necessary to abandon plan trust to number clump of tree be surrounded by party dog encouraged to go in did now then rushing back from paw of lioness hottentot now fired into clump at random volley be answered by loud roar of animal must not however show hour be passed away in manner at last be perceived at one side of jungle by swanevelt who fired with effect for animal gave loud roar then bounded out not attempting to rush upon person to make escape from assailant volley be fired at one shot took effect for fell with head to ground tumbled right over immediately after recovered made off for bush where have be first discovered be hit hard that time at event said major yes sir said bremen be deathshot must think be not dead yet may give great deal of trouble followed a fast a must on foot dog be soon upon again animal continued to roar always from same spot so that be evident be severely wounded alexander major reserved fire approached to where dog be baying not twenty yard from jungle roar be given suddenly body of lioness rushed through air right in direction where stood passed however between when reached ground fell on side quite dead be last expiring effort died in attempt alexander major who be ready to fire lowered rifle when perceived that be dead well said major will say that when first saw tail be more frightened than be just now when made spring be so taken by surprise doubt be very large animal will make handsome companion to lion if live do well get home to england again will have stuffed along with put in same case trust will that will come see replied major be sure do from heart good fellow be very much pleased at having killed beast without swinton being with a must have be persuading to leave alone must have done very right replied major be two naughty boy will be well scolded when go back vote do now think have done quite enough for to day yes indeed replied major mounting horse enough to talk of life now let gallop home say nothing about having killed lion until hottentot bring to caravan chapter xxv well what sport have have be swinton first question when be joined by alexander major replied latter pretty well saw antelope quite new to tried very hard to shoot be prevented by unexpected meeting with lioness major then gave account of perceiving tail of lioness rapid retreat be very glad to hear that be so prudent major must have be very rash thing to attack lioness with only three gun so antelope escaped yes have eland say be such good eating do stay here longer do proceed up river must ask wilmot to decide point said swinton be just a please said alexander say that more go to northward more plentiful be game yes will fall in with giraffe said major be now great object of ambition have killed rhinoceros elephant now must have giraffe can kill two first animal in india other be only to be have in country when meet again indian friend wish to say that have killed what have not certainly what be good of traveling so far if one have not something to boast of when one return if say have hunted killed rhinoceros elephant may reply to beo have if add giraffe will silence observe swinton then remain master of field here come hottentot with game come swinton leave preparation for little while see what morning sport have be swinton put aside skin of sassaby that be cleaning walked with to where men be assembled be not little surprised when saw skin jaw of lion lioness be still more so when major recounted how have be shot certainly have run great risk said be glad that have be so successful be right in saying must have persuaded not to attempt be like two little boy who have taken advantage of absence of tutor to run into mischief however be glad that have be done a now hope desire to kill lion will not again lead into unnecessary danger indeed replied alexander having once accomplished feat being fully aware of great risk be run will be more prudent in future be ask of said swinton for must be unhappy if did not three return safe to cape never saw finer lion skin will arrange for that will arrive at cape in good order a usual afternoon be by hottentot devoted to eating a much a must possibly contrive to get down throat flesh of eland be pronounced excellent by traveler there be much more than must possibly consume hottentot be only allowed to bring certain quantity into camp that might not attract wild beast must have brought in although never must have eaten cattle be driven up in evening fire lighted night passed quietly away at daylight turned cattle out to graze for couple of hour then yoked proceeded on journey keeping a near a must to bank of river saw many hippopotamus snorting rising for moment above water passed by without attempting to shoot at a did not wish to disturb other game a advanced variety of flower be in bloom attracted notice of alexander who observed doe not plain put in mind of turkey carpet major so gay with variety of color yes a scentless replied major be very brilliant in appearance one modest english violet be to fancy worth agree with replied swinton still must acknowledge that country be beautiful beyond description grassy mead so spangled with numerous flower so broken by mass of grove forest look at aloe blooming in profusion with coral tuft in england what must pay for such exhibition crimson lilac hue of poppy amaryllis blended together be just in saying that there be scent in gay parterre creeper twine up stately tree be very sweetly scented how picturesque be twinings of vine upon mimosa can not well imagine garden of eden to have be more beautiful in respect there be resemblance said major laughing serpent be in yes grant replied swinton well can feel real pleasure without security if be to be ever on alert turning eye in direction may not tread upon puff adder avoid dart of cobra capella can feel little pleasure in looking at rich hue of flower conceal a said before give violet rose of england can pick smell in security agree with major said alexander continued laughing must make allowance for swinton a naturalist puff adder have charm for because add one more to numerous specimen to be obtained look upon flower a botanist rejoicing a add to herbal gather seed bulb to load wagon with might a well find fault with husbandman for rejoicing in rich harvest with for being so delighted at number variety of animal fall to rifle replied swinton smiling there have major grant replied major what be in river back of hippopotamus be back of elephant must rather think reed be so high that be difficult to ascertain there may be herd bathing in river nothing more likely let stop caravan creaking of wheel must drive away thing replied major will then ride forward see what be be not more than mile from be so replied swinton omrah get rifle tell bremen to come here now major be to be regular hunt only passing shot at for now perceive through glass that be elephant well think passing shot will be best for if be to hunt must send party on opposite side of river will be tedious affair think will be better to proceed said swinton so now then to scatter enemy soon arrived at part of river where have at distance discovered elephant bathing a approached high reed prevented from seeing animal although must hear plainly at last a proceeded little further up river discovered female with young one by side mother playing with offspring pouring water over with trunk now then pressing into water so a to compel to swim watched motion of animal for time major first broke silence by saying really have not heart to fire at poor creature maternal kindness playing of little one be too interesting must be cruel now that want meat for eland be to be killed ten minute be glad to hear say so replied swinton let fire over set in motion agreed said major be to start fired off rifle in air noise ensued be quite appalling shriek cry of elephant treading down rushing through reed splashing floundering in mud for few second be followed by bounding out of whole herd on opposite bank of river tossing trunk raising up ear roaring wildly starting through bush into forest from have descended two large male only be to be perceived among whole herd rest be female young one who scrambled away after male crowding together still occasionally looking behind after young one till have disappeared in forest cracking crushing of bush in be heard for many minute afterward be splendid scene said alexander yes be living panorama must come to africa to behold think that will ever become true elephant hunter said major feel sort of repugnance to destroy so sagacious animal degree of remorse when one lie dead at same time if once accustomed to fearful crashing noise attending movement consider very dangerous animal to pursue not if people be cool collected have have several famous elephant hunter among dutch farmer remember that one of after return from successful chase made bet that must go up to wild elephant pluck eight hair out of tail did so won bet for elephant can not see behind be not very quick in turning round however short time afterward made same attempt being foolhardy from success animal be too quick for be crushed to death bremen now came up to to say that there be party of people to eastward thought that there be wagon on examination with telescope found that such be case traveler turned horse head in direction to ascertain who might be leaving caravan to proceed by bank of river in about hour came close to swinton immediately recognized a griquas mixed european hottentot race of course met in most friendly manner griquas said that have come to hunt elephant eland other animal former for ivory latter for flesh wagon be very old one be loaded with flesh cut in long strip hanging to dry have great many hundred weight of ivory have already collected a soon a traveler have explained to own motion griquas said that must bring wagon down in evening encamp with traveler then returned to caravan a promised griquas joined late in afternoon be party of sixteen stout fellow armed with long gun used by dutch boor said that have be two month from griqua town be thinking of returning very soon a wagon be loaded to extent that must bear major stating that be intention to hunt giraffe griquas informed that must not find animal to southward of val river must have to cross over into territory of king moselekatsee who ruled over bechuana country to northward of river that must be very dangerous to attempt so to do without permission indeed that there must be danger in doing so even with do know thing of person swinton yes have heard of did not know that have extended conquest so low down a to val river who be have heard of chaka king of zoolus who conquered whole country a far a port natal to eastward yes replied alexander have heard of well moselekatsee be chief of two three tribe who when hard pressed by enemy took refuge with chaka became one of principal warrior chief after time quarreled with chaka about distribution of cattle have taken aware that have mercy to expect from tyrant revolted from with large force withdrew to bechuana country there conquered tribe enrolled in own army gradually became a formidable a chaka in arrangement of army followed same plan a chaka have now become most powerful monarch do say be almost a great tyrant despot a chaka be believe that griquas be right in saying there must be danger in passing through dominion without permission said alexander suppose if send message to present there will be difficulty perhaps not except that caravan may excite cupidity may be induced to delay to obtain possession of content however have better put question to griquas who probably can answer better griquas on being questioned replied that best plan must be to send message to matabili capital where moselekatsee resided requesting permission to hunt in country begging monarch to send of principal men to receive present have to offer that must not take long to receive answer a must only be necessary to deliver message to first officer belonging to moselekatsee at advanced post that officer must immediately dispatch native with message who must arrive much sooner than one must send bremen three other hottentot offered to take message if traveler wished be agreed to afternoon mounted horse crossed river by advice of griquas camp be shifted about mile further up river on account of lion weather now threatened change mass of cloud accumulated be again dispersed next day weather be again threatening thunder pealed in distant mountain forked lightning flew in direction rain if be expended on neighboring hill strong wind soon blew up so a to try strength of canvas awning of wagon found difficult to keep fire in at night have encamped upon wide plain covered with high grass abounding with eland other variety of antelope here remained for five day waiting reply of king of matabili went out day to procure game on sabbath day after have a usual performed divine service observed heavy smoke to windward a wind be fresh soon bore down upon inconvenienced much swanevelt stated that high grass have be fired by mean a threatened to come down upon encampment hottentot griquas be very busy beating down grass round about when have so done went to windward hundred yard set fire to grass in several place grass burned quickly till arrived at where have be beaten down fire be extinguished that be necessary precaution be fully proved for a night closed in whole country for mile be on fire wind bore flame down rapidly toward sky be covered with cloud darkness of night made flame appear still more vivid wind drove along with loud crackling noise sweeping over undulating ground now rising now disappearing in hollow whole landscape lighted up for mile a traveler watched progress of flame now then observed terrified antelope spring from lair appearing like black figure in phantasmagoria suddenly storm burst upon rain poured down in torrent accompanied with large hailstone thunder lightning wind be instantly lulled after first burst of storm deathlike silence succeeded to crackling of flame deluge of rain descended in instant spark of conflagration be extinguished pitchy darkness of night be unbroken by even solitary star next morning be bright clear after breakfast perceived hottentot who have be sent on message to moselekatsee on opposite bank of river accompanied by three of native soon crossed river came to encampment native who be matabili be tall powerful men well proportioned with regular feature hair be shorn surmounted with oval ring attached to scalp lobe of left ear be perforated with large hole that contained small gourd be used a snuff box dress be girdle of strip of catskins carried two javelin knobbed stick for throwing be heartily welcomed by traveler who placed before large quantity of eland steak filled box with snuff a soon a have finished eating drawn up large quantity of snuff into nostril explained through griquas who must speak language that have come from greatest of monarch in world moselekatsee who wished to know who stranger be what wanted of what present have brought swinton who be spokesman returned for answer that be hunter not trader that have come to see wonder of country belonging to so great monarch that hearing that majesty have animal in country be not to be found elsewhere wanted permission to kill to show upon return to own people what wonderful country be that belonged to so great monarch that have brought bead copper wire knife box for making fire snuff tobacco of wished to present to great monarch part a soon a have received permission to enter territory part when be about to leave handsome present of above article be then produced messenger of king having surveyed article with astonishment declared that king must feel very glad when saw thing that have desired to tell traveler that might come into dominion with safety kill animal that pleased that majesty have commanded one of to remain with party that a soon a have received present must send chief to be answerable for safety matabili then packed up article presented two of set off at full speed on return to king third who remained assured traveler that might cross river enter matabili country a soon a pleased debate now ensued a to whether must go with whole force not matabili have informed that in three day journey must fall in with giraffe be in search of a there must be risk in crossing river have reason to expect that must soon rise question be whether must be prudent to take over even one of wagon opinion of griquas be asked be ultimately arranged that must take over alexander wagon only with fifteen pair of ox that of griquas must accompany with swanevelt omrah mahomed that bremen hottentot must remain where be with other three wagon rest of griquas until traveler must return arrangement be not at disagreeable to hottentot who did not much like idea of entering matabili country be very happy in present quarter a be plentifully provided with good meat alexander wagon be therefore arranged so a to carry bedding article might require other thing being removed to other wagon best ox be selected eight of fleetest of horse on following morning having ascertained from matabili best place to cross river traveler set off in hour be on other side there be change in country during first day journey same variety brilliancy of flower be where to be seen eland other antelope be plentiful be soon joined by party of native who requested to shoot animal for did in quantity even sufficient to satisfy indeed if found troublesome traveler have only to bring down eland native be immediately left behind that might devour animal be done in incredibly short space of time matabili who have conducted proved to be chief if gave order be instantly obeyed so that traveler have trouble with native except begging praying for snuff be incessant from men woman did fear treachery from matabili king a be well armed griquas be brave men superiority of weapon made match for large force precaution however be taken when halted at night invariably did in center of open plain to prevent surprise large fire be lighted round wagon traveled on in way for two day more when in evening arrived at large plain sprinkled with mimosa tree abutting on foot of low range of hill matabili told that must find giraffe on plain major who be very anxious kept telescope to eye looking round in direction till did not succeed in descrying of object of search retired that night with anxious expectation for following morning when anticipated that must fall in with remarkable animal gun be examined precaution taken having lighted fire set watch went to bed after commending to care of providence be soon fast asleep chapter xxvi with exception of three lion coming very near to encampment rousing up griquas nothing occurred during night in morning yoked ox have horse saddled ready for chase be disappointed for nearly whole day a although saw variety of game giraffe appeared in sight in afternoon a passed by clump of mimosa be charged by rhinoceros nearly threw down alexander best horse volley from griquas laid prostrate be very large animal not of black ferocious sort being what be termed white rhinoceros within last two day have also observed that gnoo be not of same sort a one have seen so long variety swinton told be called brindled gnoo be however in other respect same animal a to motion peculiarity toward evening matabili warrior who accompanied pointed to mimosa at distance made sign to major that there be giraffe can not see do alexander said major point to mimosa with dead stump on other side of there yes be one see stump a called move must be neck of animal let loose dog swanevelt cried major starting off at full speed followed by alexander omrah with spare horse in minute two giraffe be seen to get clear of mimosa then set off in awkward shambling kind of gallop awkward a gallop appeared animal soon left major behind sailed along with incredible velocity long swan like neck keeping time with leg black tail curled above back push on alexander cried major if ever there be seven league boot animal have pair of on go like wind can not keep up long depend upon horse be in capital condition alexander major be now neck neck close to other at full speed when of sudden major horse stumbled fell upon ostrich be sitting on nest alexander horse also stumbled followed after major there be horse rider rolling together among ostrich egg while ostrich gained leg ran off a fast a giraffe a soon a have got on leg again caught bridle of horse looked round must not distinguish giraffe be out of sight among mimosa tree while omrah be very busy picking up rifle laughing in very disrespectful manner major alexander soon joined in laugh bone be broken horse have received no injury have to do be to return to caravan looking very foolish first essay in giraffe hunting have be very successful said swinton laughing a came up to yes threw very pretty summerset did not said alexander however have got ostrich egg for supper be better than nothing will soon be dark so have better encamp for night have not be about to propose said swinton did ever hunt giraffe swinton inquired alexander a be making supper on roasted ostrich egg of holding one between knee dipping out with large spoon never replied swinton have often seen in namaqua land never killed one remember however circumstance connected with giraffe must have be incredible to if have not seen remains of lion be well aware how long strong be thorn of mimosa kamel tree a dutch call from giraffe browsing upon how bough of tree lie like umbrella close upon one native chief informed that witnessed lion attacking giraffe lion always spring at head neck seizes animal by part riding a be giraffe set off at full speed with enemy be so powerful a often to get rid of for have seen giraffe killed have mark of lion teeth claw upon in instance lion made spring giraffe at very moment turning sharp round lion missed aim by blow received be tossed in air so that fell upon bough of mimosa on back bough be not only compact enough to bear weight thorn pierced through body be so strong a to hold enormous animal where lay must not disengage pointed out to skeleton on bough of tree a corroboration of truth of story doe really approach to marvelous observed major a say seeing be believing trust that will be more fortunate to morrow have gained piece of information from swanevelt said swinton make very anxious that must leave a soon a possible be that matabili king have idea that have griquas in company still le that be to come into country with only griquas a attendant be not perhaps aware that moselekatsee be deadly enemy of griquas with whom have have several severe conflict that be not very safe on account why did not griquas say so replied alexander because care for matabili presume be glad to come into country that may know something of in case of making attack upon depend upon a soon a king hears of will be looked upon a spy may send party to cut off have said thing to griquas yes laughed said that must not care if went right up to principal town where moselekatsee resides well be bold enough so far be good traveling companion certainly did not come here to fight observed major doe matabili with know that be griquas did not supposed that be cape people whom have brought with have found out by hottentot suppose swanevelt say that very first body of matabili that fell in with sent runner off immediately presume to give information think therefore that sooner can get away better well agree with swinton replied alexander will try for giraffe to morrow when major have have satisfaction of killing one will retrace step for must be attacked will be impossible to defend long against number so now to bed rose early next morning leaving wagon where be again proceeded on horseback in search of giraffe rode at slow pace for four five mile before must discover at last herd of be seen standing together browsing on leaf of mimosa made long circuit to turn drive toward camp in succeeded animal set off at usual rapid pace did not keep up long a there be several not full grown among must not get over ground so fast a large male of preceding day after chase of three mile found that animal speed be rapidly decreasing be coming up with when within hundred yard alexander fired wounded female be in rear major pushed on with dog after large male stopped at bay under mimosa kicking most furiously at dog major leveled rifle brought animal down with first shot rose again however for hundred yard went away at fast pace again fell to rise more female alexander have wounded received shot be then also prostrated have killed giraffe said major standing by side of one have killed have be long way to travel there have be danger to encounter for sake of performing feat have folly be eager in pursuit of just a great trifle through life so that in be not perhaps more foolish than rest of mankind have obtained wish have killed giraffe now care how soon go back again do replied alexander for can say with when arrive in england too have killed giraffe so will not be able to boast over by swinton account if stay here much longer will have to kill matabili be not anxious to do therefore now say with care how soon go back to cape a be not more than two mile from wagon rode back sent griquas to bring in flesh of animal swinton not caring for skin a have already procured in namaqua land weight of must be so very great for wagon on return have conversation with griquas who candidly acknowledged that be very likely that matabili king must attempt to cut off although appeared not at afraid of making attempt however readily consented to return next morning night messenger arrived to matabili chief who be escorting be communication of course traveler must not tell suspicion be confirmed by behavior of man when found that on following morning yoked ox retraced step begged not to go to advance into interior of country where must find plenty of game told that king must be very angry if left so soon if did not see heart must be very sad traveler have made up mind traveled back during whole of day matabili dispatched messenger who have come to who again set off at speed at night urged traveler not to go back saying that king must be very angry with a griquas be now equally convinced that treachery be intended paid attention to matabili chief continued route shooting eland by way for sustenance late in evening of third day found on border of val river be still two hour before dark a matabili pressed to encamp where be be satisfied that have better not therefore forded river rejoined caravan under charge of bremen just a night closed in griquas said that from matabili wishing to remain on other side of river be persuaded that force must arrive during night following morning that must be necessary to be on look out although probably enemy must not venture to attack without further order now that be no longer in moselekatsee dominion preparation be therefore made griquas hottentot be supplied with ammunition mustered with gun in hand wagon be arranged fire lighted four men be posted a sentinel round encampment what added still more to suspicion be that about hour after dark matabili chief be not to be found opinion be said major that ought to steal march upon ox be in excellent condition may travel till to morrow evening without feeling let yoke be off at once now that be dark moon will rise about two o'clock in morning before that wagon will be twelve fifteen mile off alexander with bremen will remain here with horse wait till moon rise to see if can discover thing can easily join wagon by daybreak will keep fire up to allow to suppose that be still encamped that may not pursue also to keep off lion observed alexander be not enemy to be despised think be very good plan why not have more men with have plenty of horse so have griquas well then let talk to griquas griquas approved of plan having own horse six of agreed to remain with alexander major swanevelt two more of hottentot be also mounted to remain made force of twelve men well mounted well armed remainder of caravan yoked ox to wagon under direction of swinton set off in southerly direction across desert instead of going by bank of val river a before have be arranged previously to expected attack from matabili a must considerably shorten distance on returning although knew that must find much difficulty in procuring water for few day after caravan have departed be found that omrah have helped to horse gun have remained in camp a be always useful so doing be passed over without notice in hour wagon be out of sight noise of wheel be no longer to be heard fastened horse in center of fire sat down by till moon rose when directed eye to opposite bank of river for time nothing be discovered to confirm suspicion when moon be about hour high perceived body of men coming down toward bank moon shone upon shield be white a soon a arrived at bank of river sat down without making noise shortly afterward body with dark colored shield made appearance who came down joined first be not wrong in suspicion at event said major must say that there be not le than thousand men in two party have already appeared now what will do will remain here will be off join wagon really can hardly decide must be best replied alexander let have consultation with bremen griquas if be to go away now said bremen fire must soon be out might suspect something come over to reconnoiter when found that be gone must perhaps follow overtake wagon if remain here keep fire up till daybreak wagon will have gained so much more distance griquas be of same opinion be decided that must remain there till daybreak then set off said alexander will leave before can see allow to see griquas said that must be better that enemy must see a then must know that fire have be kept up to deceive that wagon be probably long way off having be agreed upon careful watch be kept upon enemy during remainder of night although moon have discovered approach of matabili to party spot where camp have be pitched be in shade so that from opposite side of river only fire must be distinguished little before dawn one be heard approaching be prepared to fire when discovered that be omrah who unknown to have crawled down to bank of river to reconnoiter enemy omrah who be out of breath with running stated that of matabili be crossing river that six have landed on side before came up to give information pointed to clump of tree about three hundred yard off said that have gone up in direction be probably there by time then have better saddle mount said major ride away gently to wood on side of camp will then be able to watch motion without being seen advice be good approved by led out horse without noise a soon a have done so went back threw more fuel on fire then retreated to wood be about same distance from camp on other side a clump of tree where matabili be secreted have hardly concealed before matabili in clump surprised at not seeing awning of wagon suspecting that have be deceived came out from ambuscade first crawling on four a arrived at camp found only fire burning rising up one after after remaining about minute in consultation two of party be sent back to river to communicate intelligence to main body while others searched about in direction alexander with major party remained where be a be intention to cross through wood until came to open ground about quarter of mile to southward then show to enemy before went to join wagon in few minute be daylight now perceived that whole body of matabili be crossing river intend to pursue then said alexander omrah now pointed to side of river in direction wagon have traveled when came up by bank saying when go away ride that way first same track wagon go way back same way wagon come boy be right said major when start from wood will keep by riverside in track by wagon came when be concealed from by hill tree will then start off to southward after wagon see replied alexander will probably take mark of wagon wheel coming here for of wagon going away will follow presuming a go way that wagon have gone also here come up bank be time for to be off quite time said major so now let show then trust to heel matabili force be now within four hundred yard of camp be broad daylight with white red shield short spear in hand presented very formidable appearance there be time to be lost so party rode out of end of wood nearest river a soon a made appearance be received by yell from warrior who dashed forward in direction where stood major have directed that one must fire a alexander did not wish that blood must be shed unnecessarily therefore waved hand turning horse head galloped off by bank of river keeping in track made by wagon when came up a soon a galloped quarter of mile pulled up turned horse head to reconnoiter perceived that matabili force be pursuing at utmost speed a have horseman that speed be of course insufficient to overtake well mounted party in advance a soon a be near party again galloped off left behind thus continued for four five mile matabili force pursuing rather following track of wagon when observed belt of tree before about mile off major considered a good screen to enable to alter course without being perceived by enemy therefore galloped forward a soon a be hidden by tree turned off in direction by made certain to fall in with track wagon have made on departure during night have ridden about two mile still concealed in wood when have satisfaction of perceiving matabili force still following at rapid pace track of wagon on riverside having watched for hour a now considered that be safe again continued course so a to fall in with wagon think be clear of now said major have evidently fallen into trap proposed by clever little fellow omrah be very intelligent boy observed alexander traveling in country worth weight in gold wish swinton must make over to said major alexander do observe what change there be already in country do indeed replied alexander ahead of appears to be still more sterile bare yes when leave river leave vegetation of kind almost there be regular rainy season at here swinton say may expect occasional torrent of rain during three month be now very uncertain mountain attract greater portion of rain sometimes there will not be shower on plain for whole year how far will have to travel before fall in with water again inquired alexander swinton say there may be water in river about sixty mile from where started last night if not will have to proceed about thirty mile further to gykoup vet river after that will have to depend for many day upon water may find in hole a season be now coming on may probably be filled by rain alexander party rode for seven eight mile before fell in with track of caravan then pulled up jaded horse proceeded at more leisurely pace so that be not till late in evening that discovered wagon at distance having passed dry bed of salt river ahead of during whole day horse have have food water animal be much exhausted when came up with wagon ox also be fatigued with so long journey having made nearly fifty mile since started evening before country be now stony sterile little vegetation be to be found here there not sufficient to meet want of animal water there be none during day little game have be seen few zebra ostrich only other variety have disappeared there be of course wood to light fire round encampment sufficiency for cooking victual have be thrown into wagon two sheep be killed to supply supper for so numerous party absence of game also denoted absence of lion be not disturbed during night in morning griquas parted company with on plea that ox horse be in too poor condition to pas over desert that must make direct course for val river return by bank traveler gave good supply of ammunition only thing that wished for griquas yoking ox to crazy old wagon set off in westerly direction route of caravan be now directed more to south west passed over uninterrupted plain strewed with small land tortoise covered with profusion of gayest flower about noon after sultry journey of nine hour fortunately arrived at bog in found pool of most fetid water nothing necessity must have compelled exhausted animal to drink near pool in desert found several wild animal obtained three gnoos for supply of provision little wood that have in wagon for fuel be used up in cooking supper heavy dew fell during night in morning before sun rose be enveloped in thick fog a fog dispersed perceived herd of quagga in direction at great distance again yoked ox proceeded on journey country be now covered with herbage flower of hue looked like garden how strange that ground must be covered with flower where there be rain water to be found observed alexander be heavy dew of night support said swinton perhaps occasional rain fall line of tree to southward told that be now approaching unnamed river tired ox quickened pace on arrival found that bed of river be dry not even drop of water be to be found in pool poor animal have be unyoked snuffed smelt at wet damp earth licked with tongue must obtain relief water have have in cask for own drinking be now gone there be hope of obtaining till arrived at vet river at least twenty five to thirty mile distant two of ox lay down to rise more countenance of hottentot be dejected sullen traveler felt that situation be alarming while be still searching digging for water sky became overcast thunder lightning be seen heard in distance cloud came rolling in volume toward hope be now in face already anticipated copious shower be to succeed eye ever fixed upon coming storm even cattle appeared to be conscious that relief be at hand day cloud continued to gather lightning to gleam night closed in rain have not yet fallen wind rose up in le than hour cloud have passed away star shone out brightly be left in state of suffering disappointment chapter xxvii a traveler be sitting together occupied with own melancholy thought after dispersion of cloud anticipated relief major said be useless remaining here must perish if proceed must be better for to yoke travel by night animal will bear journey better people will not be so inclined to brood over misfortune when on march a when thus huddled together here communicating lamentation to dishearten other be now nine o'clock let yoke push on a far a can agree with major said alexander what do say swinton be convinced that will be best plan so let rouse up people at once there be roar of lion at distance have fire to scare off creaking of wagon wheel will be better than nothing replied major hottentot be roused order given to yoke poor fellow be sound asleep for hottentot when hunger thirst seek refuge from misery in sleep ox be yoked proceeded hardly have gone mile when roar of three four lion close upon caused such alarm to horse ox be not yoked that started off in full gallop in northerly direction alexander major omrah who be best mounted immediately set off in pursuit of desiring swinton to proceed with caravan must drive on cattle join galloped off a well a horse must gallop perceived stray horse ox still at full speed a if be chased by lion followed in direction be now so dark that be guided only by clatter of hoof shoe in distance after chase of four five mile have lost vestige of pulled up panting steed may a well go back again said alexander animal must have made circuit suppose so said major horse tremble so that have better dismount for little while that may recover indeed so have too omrah for animal be completely worn out cloud be rising again said alexander trust that may not be disappointed second time yes there be lightning again in horizon may almighty help in distress exclaimed major horse exhausted from want of water continued to pant so fearfully that be nearly hour before ventured to mount that might return to caravan in meantime heaven have become wholly obscured by cloud there be prospect of heavy shower at last few drop did fall thank god exclaimed alexander a lifted face up to heaven to feel drop a fell now let return mounted horse set off star be no longer visible to guide proceeded on at slow pace uncertain whether be right wrong cared little about thought be upon coming rain so anxiously awaited for more than three hour be tantalized by lightning flashing thunder pealing moment expecting flood gate of heaven to be opened a before be doomed to disappointment before morning dawned cloud have again retreated when sky be clear found by star that horse head be turned to northward eastward altered course in silence for be worn out despondent suffered dreadfully from thirst be pitiable to see tongue of poor horse hanging out of mouth day dawned there be sign of caravan thick vapor be rising from quarter hoped that when cleared up must be more fortunate there be same monotonous landscape same carpet of flower without perfume sun be now three hour high heat be intense tongue clove to roof of mouth while still went on over flowery mead forest pool tree might denote bed of river caught earnest gaze be dreadful said alexander at last speaking with difficulty be lost that be certain said major must trust in god yes may now say lord help perish replied alexander at moment little omrah who have be behind rode up to offered one of hottentot pipe have lighted saying smoke not feel so bad alexander took after few whiff found that have effect producing little saliva handed to major who did same felt immediate relief continued to walk horse in southerly direction heat be now so great that became almost insufferable at last horse stood still dismounted drove horse slowly before over glowing plain now mirage deluded tantalized in strangest manner at one time alexander pointed with delight for must not speak to what imagined to be wagon pushed on found that be solitary quagga magnified thus by mirage sometimes thought that saw lake of water in distance hastened on to then fancied be close to river island covered with luxuriant foliage still be doomed to disappointment a be result of highly rarefied air refraction of sun ray on sultry plain what must have given for bush even to afford shelter from noonday sun for crown of head appeared a if covered with live coal mind began to wander poor horse moved at slowest pace only when driven on by omrah who appeared to suffer much le than master now then handed to pipe at last even have longer relief speech have be for hour totally lost gradually sun sunk down to horizon a scorching ray became le intense to certain degree recovered wandering sens at night sat down by side of horse worn out with fatigue exhaustion fell into troubled sleep sleep if relieved worn out frame condemned to same tantalizing feeling a have be created by mirage during day dreamed that be in bower of paradise hearing heavenly music passing from crystal stream to stream slaking thirst at reclining on couch of verdant green thing be delightful appeared to in dream be in abode of bliss thus did remain for hour two when be wakened up by roar of lion reminded that be without food water in desert awoke speechless with eye inflamed whole body burning like coal awful roar of lion still reverberated along ground started on leg found omrah close to holding bridle of horse be attempting to escape be still confused when be fully restored to waking sens by second roar of lion still nearer to by imperfect light of star must now distinguish beast at about one hundred yard distance omrah put bridle of two horse in hand motioned to go on in direction opposite to where lion be did so without reflection mechanically obeying direction of man child not perceiving that omrah did not follow have advanced about one hundred yard with terrified animal when loud roar be followed up by shriek of other horse announcing that have become victim to savage animal started dropping rein of horse hastened with rifle to help of omrah of whose absence now for first time be aware be met half way by boy who contrived to say with difficulty lion want horse not little bushman waited few second cry of poor animal crushing cracking of bone be too painful to hear hastened on rejoined other horse appeared paralyzed with fear have remained stationary again led horse on for hour when arrived at small pile of rock there again lay down for be quite exhausted careless of life not even roar of lion must have aroused now if have roused must have waited for animal to come put end to misery softer noise attracted quick ear of omrah pushed alexander put finger up to induce to listen having listened little longer omrah made sign to alexander major to follow noise omrah have heard be croaking of frog denoted water at hand sniffing of horse confirmed in supposition omrah led way through rock descending lower lower ever anon listening to noise of animal till perceived star of heaven above reflected in small pool pointed out to alexander major down dropped to earth drank a soon a thirst be satisfied rose pushed omrah forward to make drink also a boy who have saved life be drinking kneeled down prayed not loud for have not yet recovered speech if ever grateful prayer be offered up to almighty throne be by two traveler a kneeled by side of small pool rose hastened to horse led down to water when poor animal filled almost to bursting walked away returned to drink more also repeated draught several time then lay down must have fallen asleep by side of pool have not omrah who must now speak freely said lion come here for water up rock again sleep there bring horse good advice be followed when have gained summit of rising ground again lay down slept till daylight when awoke found much refreshed now felt what have not done during extreme suffering from thirst craving pang of hunger omrah be fast asleep horse picking among herbage about two hundred yard off have much to thank god for said alexander to major have indeed next to divine aid have to thank that poor boy have be a child in hand be indebted to resource for life night must not speak yesterday must courage in remaining with horse a offering to lion will not forget be child of desert replied alexander have be brought up among lion where there be scarcity of water have most wonderfully guided in path be still in desert have lost companion what must do will attempt to regain caravan push off to westward to fall in with river again will talk of hour hence replied major let now go down to pool a soon a have have drink will try if can not kill something for meal hunger be now almost a great a be thirst mine too so will go with must be careful how approach water a may fall in with animal to make meal of with lion ready to make meal of replied major so in instance must approach cautiously a walked to pool discovered head of antelope just above rock major fired animal fell report of rifle be answered by roar three lion bounded away from rock went at quick canter over plain supposition have proved correct observed alexander a walked up to where antelope lay dead how be to cook animal dry stuff will serve for fire if can only get enough very little cooking will serve just now here come omrah let carry game up to where slept last night a soon a have have drink went to pool be surprised to behold filthy puddle have appeared to so like night before be not sufficiently thirsty to overcome disgust turned away from omrah now began collecting dried grass herb lichen from rock have soon sufficiency to make small fire struck light cutting off steak from antelope be in short time very busy at repast when hunger be appeased found that thirst be renewed went down to pool shutting eye drank plentifully omrah cooked a much of meat a small fire must permit that might not want for next twenty four hour horse being again led to water to drink mounted proceeded to southward followed by omrah on foot day be passed in searching for caravan without success water be to be found heat be dreadful at night threw down on ground careless of life have not be sinful must have prayed for death next morning arose in state of dreadful suffering must not speak made sign resolved once more to attempt to join caravan proceeded during whole of forenoon in direction by hoped to discover track of wagon heat be overpowering felt agony of day before at last horse must proceed further lay down traveler have little hope of ever rising again scorching of sun ray be so dreadful that thrust head into empty ant hill to keep off heat there lay in a forlorn hopeless state a horse speak must not parched tongue rattled like board against roof of mouth lip be swollen bloated eye inflamed starting from socket a alexander afterward said to swinton then recollected thought have risen in mind on departure from english shore surmise whether might not leave bone bleaching in desert alexander now believed that such be to be case prayed mentally prepared for death major be fully possessed of same idea a lay at yard distance with head buried in ant hill must not communicate with other even by sign at last fell into state of stupor lost recollection almighty providence watched over during state of insensibility cloud again rose covered firmament time did not rise in mockery for before day be closed torrent descended from deluged whole plain omrah who have held up better than master crawled out of ant hill into have crept a soon a rain descended contrived to pull head of major alexander who still remained senseless from out of ant hill to turn blackened swollen face to sky a clothes became saturated with rain water poured into mouth gradually revived at last be completely restored wind now rose blew fresh before morning be shivering with cold when attempted to get up found limb be cramped soon after daylight rain ceased be glad to bask in then cheering ray of sun have nearly destroyed on day before horse have recovered leg be feeding close to flesh of antelope have be untasted be now greedily devoured most devoutly did return thanks for preservation hope be now held out to of ultimately regaining colony for have abandoned hope of reaching caravan a considered risk of crossing desert too great made up mind to push for val river a fast a must proceed back by bank have two horse omrah must ride behind one of when be tired have gun ammunition although be fully aware of danger to must be exposed thought lightly of after what have suffered now mounted horse proceeded at slow pace toward westward for poor animal be still very weak at sunset have traveled about ten mile looked out for spot to pas night wood to light fire have none hoped if horse be not taken away by lion to reach branch of river by following evening there be now want of water a repeatedly passed by small pool for day two at least must not be evaporated by heat of sun knew that by time if more rain fell must have again to undergo former terrible privation therefore resolved upon continuing course toward river a safest plan now that have lost caravan a be seated on rising ground have chosen for night rest occasionally firing off rifle to drive away lion be heard prowling about of sudden omrah cried out pointed to northward traveler turned perceived rocket ascending firmament at last breaking out into group of brilliant star be caravan exclaimed major swinton have remembered that put rocket into wagon must have passed said alexander springing on foot god be praised for mercy amen replied major devoutly omrah ran after horse be feeding close to for instinctive fear of lion made keep a close a possible to master be soon mounted with omrah behind major set off at speed that must obtain from animal after interval rocket be seen by light discovered that be not mile from wagon horse appeared to be sensible of went off at quicker pace in few minute have rushed in among cattle alexander major be received into arm of swinton surrounded by hottentot who be loud in congratulation at return a soon a alexander major have made known peril suffering to swinton latter informed that about three hour after have left caravan in pursuit of cattle animal have returned that of course have fully expected to follow finding that did not arrive have decided upon remaining where be at event for day that cattle be by time so exhausted that be with difficulty be moved must not proceed with more than ten mile when lay down in yoke thirteen have died others must have shared fate if have not be for providential rain have restored swinton stated that have be in great state of alarm for that have almost satisfied that have perished although have used mean that must think of when fired rocket off have scarcely hope of thus bringing back to caravan however observed swinton show that must never despair never leave chance untried even in most desperate circumstance be back again thank almighty for with heart soul strength most fervently most sincerely have be very very miserable can assure dear fellow idea of returning to cape without be dreadful indeed never must have left country until have found have clew to death preservation have indeed be miraculous replied major never thought to have raised head out of ant hill again replied alexander next to almighty certainly owe life to little omrah there be nothing must not do for boy if will only give over to care mine swinton replied major depend upon replied swinton will do for ought to be done debt of gratitude for preserving friend will not forget to repay well then must allow to help a well replied major how far be now from modder river about forty mile must think have better push on a fast a can for although river will contain water pool in desert between river will soon be dried up cattle however be still very weak a have stated have lost relay must long to have good night rest so go to wagon will watch keep off wild beast have be obliged to fire gun night long since absence have burned one of spare pole of wagon to cook victual thing be comparative when traveler first took up night lodging in wagon found resting place hard after sleeping in comfortable bed at cape town now after having passed night in wild desert mattress in wagon be luxury be fully appreciated returning thanks to heaven for preservation alexander major slept soundly till morning notwithstanding that latter be often half roused by importunity of begum who appeared delighted at return of master at daylight ox be yoked proceeded on journey there be want of game indeed be so plentiful that shot from caravan a passed at night have made twenty five mile before have unyoked deluge of rain again fell passed very uncomfortable night a be very cold must light fire from want of fuel thing however be better than want of water early in morning again yoked ox after hard day toil be rejoiced to perceive at distance tree lined bank of modder river sight be hailed with joy by hottentot who shouted aloud for considered danger difficulty to be over now that be approaching to boundary of colony chapter xxviii a cattle required repose after suffering have gone through traveler resolved to remain few day on bank of modder river pasturage be fine game abundant gnoos springbok be to be seen in direction quagga bonteboks several other variety of antelope be in profusion over now undulating country be traveler sorry to have repose for although mile that drew nearer to cape made more anxious to return a usual caravan be halted on rising ground at distance from river to avoid wild beast during day be concealed during night prowled on bank to spring upon animal came down for water a there be now plenty of wood fire be again lighted at night ox driven in tied up during day animal reveled on luxurious pasture in week have become quite sleek in good condition day traveler went out to hunt for supply of provision never returned without more than be sufficient swinton be anxious to posse one two more specimen of oryx gemsbok antelope have before observed from having very straight horn at distance appear a one have given rise to fabulous animal unicorn be now one of supporter of royal arm be very formidable animal being one traveler found with horn pierced through lion have attacked horse being now fresh in good heart alexander major went in pursuit of animal very often without success a chase be continually interrupted by herd of ostrich other game fell in way one morning having discovered with telescope that three of gemsbok be mile distant on rising ground set off accompanied by portion of hottentot on foot who be desired to go round so a to drive animal toward camp bremen big adam be of party have made circuit of three four mile so a to get on other side of game now darted down from high ground descending on plain stopped for while looking at pursuer while horseman advanced toward in opposite direction shot from alexander at last brought one of splendid animal to ground while others fled off to distance so a to give hope of again coming up with party on foot a well a horseman now proceeded to spot where gemsbok lay dead a swinton wanted animal for specimen be placed on back of horse omrah rode a usual one of hottentot went off with to camp be not more than three mile distant be debating whether must make attempt to get near to other gemsbok be still in sight at distance try for other game when perceived three lion not far from on rising ground suddenly horse from have dismounted to give time to recover wind broke loose from hottentot who held bridle galloped away toward camp cause of panic be now evident for very large male lion have detached from other two be advancing slowly toward party a soon a perceived approach of lion have not at first seized gun being wholly unprepared for such sudden attack there be great deal of confusion major cry out let one fire till tell only produced more alarm among hottentot of whom except bremen appeared to be at wit end when within fifty yard lion made one two bound in moment be among before must bring gun to shoulder retreat be general in direction not shot be fired however did not escape big adam have started back coming with force against omrah who be standing behind have fallen over boy be flat on back when lion made spring lion be standing up looking proudly at flying enemy when big adam who be close to attempted to rise gain foot perceiving animal with blow of fore paw laid prostrate again set foot upon breast in attitude again looked proudly round a if confident of superiority omrah who have sense enough to lie still have yet eye sufficiently opened to see what be going on a lion appeared to be looking at scattered party in direction away from omrah made one two turn over so a to get further off hoping that might escape unperceived lion however heard rustling turning round growled at omrah remained still again a big adam foot be turned toward omrah lion now took up position deliberately lying down at full length upon big adam body with hind quarter upon hottentot face so that not only secured prisoner watched omrah who lay about three yard from in mean time anxiety of other party may be imagined considered that big adam omrah must be sacrificed be proposed to fire with good aim so a if possible to bring animal attention indignation upon swinton cried out not to fire on account animal be not hungry even angry said swinton if let alone will probably walk away without doing injury at event firing will be signal for destruction advice of swinton be considered good especially a be backed by of bremen who also said that lion be not hungry that by way in moved tail be evidently more inclined to play than thing else in mean time pressure of lion whose weight be enormous be not only more than big adam must bear hind quarter of animal being over face prevented from breathing at last be compelled to struggle to get head clear consequence of struggling be severe bite on leg inflicted on poor adam not however in furious manner for lion merely caught at a cat must at mouse to prevent escape because be not quite dead however big adam have so far disengaged head that must now breathe a party kept cry out to to lie still continued so to do although nearly suffocated with enormous weight of animal omrah who have remained still during time perceiving that lion be licking blood flowed from wound in big adam leg thought that might a well try roll over being on back turned over on face away from lion thereupon lion rose from off big adam walked up to omrah to horror of traveler took up boy by waistcloth carrying like small bundle in mouth went back to big adam laying omrah close down to hottentot head again took up position on body now however with paw upon hottentot breast so that might keep omrah in view before little omrah have sense enough not to move during time that lion carried after be laid down change in position of lion occasioned traveler party to walk round so a to be able to watch countenance of animal a thing depended upon temper might be in major alexander became very impatient be for advancing to attack swinton persuaded not to do so until last moment lion now put fore paw upon hottentot mouth again stopped breath occasioned struggle on part of big adam be followed by animal seizing by arm biting severely in so doing lion removed paw man must breathe again taste of blood appeared pleasant to lion for continued biting arm descending from shoulder to hand a blood flowed from wound on paw lion licked off again again licked paw clean then with glaring eye fixed intently upon hottentot face smelt first on one side then on other appeared only to be waiting for return of appetite to commence deliberate meal upon poor fellow body in mean time traveler be standing about seventy yard distant waiting for signal to attack when bremen observed to swinton wo wait much longer sir blood have given appetite must now drive away will be killed think so too replied swinton let first try if can disturb without making angry will be best way must go back out of springing distance then shout together keep hallooing at advice be followed retreated hundred yard then shouted at once after that hottentot hallooed bawled to lion have effect intended lion rose from body advanced toward party who stood still hallooing at not attempting to irritate by presenting gun lion looked steadfastly at for time then turned away after retreating few step turned back to face whole party continued on same spot advancing so a to irritate retreating so a to let animal suppose that be afraid of when lion have continued for few minute course of retreating advancing turned right round went away at hand canter traveler immediately hastened to spot where big adam omrah be still lying omrah who be not at hurt instantly jumped on leg if have be afraid appeared to have quite recovered courage a cut manner of caper laughed immoderately big adam be greatly exhausted must not move a much from immense pressure of lion enormous body a from blood that have lost by wound have received on examination bite in leg be found to be much most serious a bone be injured wound on arm be flesh wound although very painful be not dangerous be at present unable to speak be carried by comrade to camp traveler followed hottentot a have enough of hunting for day a soon a arrived big adam wound be dressed by swinton poor fellow be accommodated

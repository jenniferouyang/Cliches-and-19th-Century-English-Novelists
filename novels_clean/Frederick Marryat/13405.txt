of caution with proceeded be more effect of savage cunning nature than fear of being seen of meeting with kind of resistance two ladder be fixed against one of tower indian ascended upon at first cast inquisitive glance through hole upon side of door concealed then umbiquas formed in circle round ladder with bow spear watching loop hole at chief command first blow be struck indian on ladder began to batter door with tomahawk while in act of striking for third time umbiqua on eastern door staggered fell down ladder breast have be pierced by arrow at same moment loud scream from other tower

leather rope fifty foot long a thick a woman little finger hanging from pommel of saddle be terrible arm against there be little possibility of contending even if adversary posse rifle for casting of lasso be done with rapidity of thought attempt to turn round fire must indubitably seal fate only mean to escape fatal noose be to raise rein of horse to top of head hold thing diagonally from body such a lance carbine anything except knife must hold in right hand ready for use chance then be if lasso fall above head must slip then be lost throw if be quick enough to pas knife through noose cut a be dragged back then advantage becomes yours at least be equally divided for then may turn upon enemy whose bow lance rifle for better management of lasso have be left behind too firmly tied about to be disengaged used in so short time can only oppose with knife tomahawk if choose may employ own lasso in case position be reversed still conquest belongs to most active of two often happens that after having cut lasso turned upon foe indian without diminishing speed of horse will pick up from ground where have dropped rifle lance then of course victory be in hand escaped once from being

indian mexican be admirably expert in handling deadly weapon before arrival of prince seravalle shoshone have buckler soon cast aside a incumbrance skill be wasted upon proper management of defensive armour being now applied to improved use of lance doubt much whether in tournament of day of chivalry gallant knight must show to ladye love greater skill than shoshone can exhibit when fighting against arrapahoe crow footnote crow neighbour who be of dacotah race be also excellent horseman most admirably dressed fond of show can not be compared to shoshone have not same skill moreover abuse change horse so often that poor brute be never accustomed to master most wonderful feat of shoshone also of comanche apache be facility with will hang alongside horse in charge upon enemy being

handle bow right one very nearly so to draw arrow watch opportunity unless previously wounded seldom miss aim have said that shoshone threw away buckler at instigation of prince seravalle who also taught european cavalry tactic have sense enough to perceive advantage must gain from be immediately incorporated a far a possible with own shoshone now charge in squadron with lance form square wheel with wonderful precision execute many difficult manoeuvre a combine european tactic with own indian mode of warfare one of most singular sight be to witness disappearance behind horse after indian fashion of whole body of perhaps five hundred horse when in full charge effect be most strange at one moment see horse mounted by gallant fellow rushing to conflict at given signal man have disappeared horse in perfect line appear a if charging without rider of own accord upon rank of enemy have dwelt perhaps too long upon manner habit of people can not help however giving reader proof of knowledge higher class among really posse have said that be good astronomer may add that intuitive knowledge of geometry be remarkable once asked young chief what considered height of lofty pine be in afternoon about three o'clock walked to end of shadow thrown by pine tree fixed arrow in ground measured length of arrow then length of shadow thrown by then measuring shadow of pine deducted from in same proportion a difference between length of arrow length of shadow gave result worked rule of three without knowing most remarkable instance occurred when be about to cross wide rapid river required rope to be thrown across a stay to men horse question be what be length of rope required ie be width of river old chief stepped horse forward to solve problem did a follows went down to side of river fixed upon spot a centre then selected two tree on right left on other side a near a eye must measure equidistant from where stood having so done backed horse from river until came to where eye told that have obtained point of equilateral triangle thus in diagram selected two tree b walked back to e there fixed lance then fell back in direction e d until have a nearly a must tell made distance from e equal to from e d fixed lance same be repeated to e c when last lance be fixed then have parallelogram a distance from f to e be exactly equal to distance from e to g have to measure space between bank of river e deduct from e g obtained width of river required illustration think that calculation proved to be perfectly correct occupied old chief more than three minute must be remembered that be done in face of enemy resume own history chapter x in narrating unhappy death of prince have stated that crow bore good will to white men established among shoshone that feeling however be not confined to tribe be shared by others within two three hundred mile from buona ventura river be not surprising since arrival tribe have acquired certain degree of tactic unity of action be sufficient in to bear down enemy independent of immense power have obtained from quantity of fire arm almost inexhaustible ammunition other nation be jealous of strength resource jealousy being now worked up to climax determined to unite strike great blow not only to destroy ascendancy shoshone have attained also to posse of immense wealth foolishly supposed european have brought with to settlement for long time previous to crow umbiqua expedition have detailed messenger have be passing between tribe tribe strange to say have buried private animosity to form league against common enemy a be considered shoshone be doubt owing to arrangement that crow umbiquas showed so hardy prompt successful retaliation of shoshone cooled little war spirit be fomenting around however arrapahoes having consented to join league united confederate at once opened campaign broke upon country in direction be taken by surprise for first three week carried everything before for majority of warrior be still hunting having be apprised of danger returned in haste aspect of affair soon changed lost ground be regained inch by inch arrapahoes having suffered great deal retired from league having now nothing to fear from south turned against assailant on northern boundary notwithstanding desertion of arrapahoes united tribe be still three time number wanted union did not act in concert mustered about fifteen thousand warrior from umbiquas callapoos cayuse nez perces bonnaxes flat head of crow who have not yet gained prudence from last brushing superiority of arm tactic discipline art of intrenchment together with good service of two clumsy old spanish four pounder enabled not only in short time to destroy league also to crush annihilate for ever of treacherous neighbour a must be tedious to stranger to follow movement of whole campaign will merely mention that part of in assisted footnote system of prairie warfare be so different from ours that campaign have just related will not be easily understood by acquainted only with european military tactic when european army start upon expedition be always accompanied by waggon carrying store of provision ammunition of kind there be commissariat appointed for purpose of feeding troop among indian there be such thing except few piece of dried venison pound weight of powder corresponding quantity of lead if have rifle if not with lance bow arrow tomahawk warrior enters war path in closer country for water fuel trust to stream to tree of forest mountain when in prairie to mud hole chasm for water to buffalo dung for fire rifle arrow will always give enough of food supply must not of course be sufficient for great number of men ten thousand for example water hole must be drained by first two three hundred men might arrive remainder must be obliged to go without then unless perchance must fall upon large herd of buffalo must never be able to find mean of sustaining life buffalo three four deer can be killed day by hunter out of tract of expedition supply must suffice for small war party must never do for army except in buffalo range where comanche apache southern shoshone will often go by band of thousand generality of indian enter path in kind of echelonage be to say supposing shoshone to send two thousand men against crow must be divided into fifteen twenty band commanded by inferior chief first party will start for reconnoitering next day second band accompanied by great chief will follow in track so on with third till three hundred three hundred fifty be united together then will begin operation new party coming to take place of who have suffered till retire to make room for others new comer brings supply of provision produce of chase in coming so that who be fighting need be in fear of wanting necessary of life by reader will see that band of two thousand warrior only four five hundred be effectually fighting unless number of warrior agreed upon by chief prove too small when new reinforcement be sent forward be divided into four war party one acted against bonnaxes flat head in north east second against cayuse nez perces at fork of buona ventura calumet river third remained near settlement to protect from surprise while fourth very small one under father command to be attached remained in about boat house at fishing station independent of four party well armed band be despatched into umbiqua country by land sea in beginning warfare on shore of pacific amounted merely to skirmish by bye callapoos having joined umbiquas with numerous party game assumed more interest not only lost advantage in umbiqua country be obliged little by little to retire to post however proved to be salvation be one hundred six men whilst adversary mustered four hundred eighty

genius at others infantry be exposed cavalry performing useless evolution be evident that two power be struggling with other one endeavouring to maintain regular discipline other following only impulse of unsteady overbearing temper discovery of course rendered somewhat more confident be with small pride reflected that in army alone commanded be pretty sight to look at shoshone who already understood strength gained by simultaneous action apache too in frequent encounter with regular troop have acquired certain knowledge of cavalry tactic traveller in mexico who have met with intrepid warrior have wondered at gallant uniform bearing californian also having now so much at stake have assumed demeanour quite contrary to usual indolent nature confidence in be much increased since success against fonseca comparison must now make between disposition arrangement of opposed force so elated indeed be so positive of success that frequently urged to immediate attack determined upon line of conduct to adhered arrapahoes showed little unruly brave such excellent horseman a almost to realize fable of centaur charging enemy with impetuosity of lightning disappearing with quickness of thought requested moment to engage knew too well value of regular infantry how ineffectual must be effort of light cavalry against bayonet be obliged to restrain ardour by argument must muster principally by giving to understand that by hasty attack must certainly lose booty moment came at last prudence of old commander having be evidently overruled by ignorant coadjutor infantry be put in motion flanked on one side by cavalry on other by artillery be indeed pitiful movement for paid dearly despatched arrapahoes to out flank charge cavalry of enemy when signal must be made apache slowly descended hill in face of infantry upon opened destructive fire with four field piece infantry behaved well never flinched stood ground a brave soldier must do signal to charge be given to arrapahoes

of determination gallantry found in mexican bayonet barrier of steel lance must not penetrate chance however be still ours mexican artillery be in power cavalry dispersed almost out of sight infantry though admirably disciplined be very hardly pressed in flank in front at juncture sent gabriel to bring back arrapahoes to scene of conflict for knew that mexican cavalry must never form again until have reached border of senora of course coadjutor of martinez have disappeared with fugitive cavalry leaving old general to regain lost advantage to bear consequence of own cowardice folly now left master of action talented officer did not yet despair of success by admirable manoeuvre threw infantry into two division so a to check body of cavalry until must form into solid square charging with impetuosity through shoshone regained possession of piece of artillery after retreating slowly succeeded in reaching without further loss ground have occupied previous to advance from more broken uneven nature enabled infantry to resist charge of cavalry with considerable advantage manoeuvre of old general extricated troop from dangerous position recovered field piece have also advantage of rendering artillery of further service a must not move down hill a battle be still to be fought resolved to attack before have time to breathe while be yet panting exhausted with recent exertion till then californian have be merely spectator of conflict now put at head charged mexican square in front while shoshone did same on left apache on right five six time be repulsed repeated charge old commander everywhere giving direction encouraging men roche be wounded fifteen of californian dead rank of shoshone much thinned by unceasing fire of artillery apache be giving way in confusion be beginning to doubt of success when gabriel having succeeded in recalling arrapahoes from pursuit of fugitive cavalry re formed made furious charge upon mexican on only side of square not already assailed precisely at moment when last desperate effort of shoshone own body of californian have thrown rank opposed to into confusion brave old commander perceiving must no longer keep ground retreated slowly with intention of gaining rugged broken ground at base of mountain behind where cavalry must no longer assail perceiving intention determining if possible to prevent retreat arrapahoes having now rejoined formed into one compact body made final decisive charge proved irresistible broke through rank dispersed for time command power ceased indian be following own custom of killing without mercy scalping dead one half of enemy be destroyed succeeded remainder in reaching intended position mexican troop considered useless to contend more shortly afterwards old general rode towards with flag to ascertain condition under must accept surrender poor man be truly estimable officer indian opened rank to let pas while californian who felt for mortification uncovered a mark of respect old general demanded free passage back to senora big tear be in eye a made proposal speaking of younger associate never used word to disparagement though slight curl of lip showed plainly how bitter be feeling knew too that fate be sealed that alone must bear disgrace of defeat so much be respected by californian that request be immediately granted upon assurance that under

resolved must now visit comanche with view to furtherance of object country on east side of rio grande be one dreary desert in water be to be procured believe indian have ever done more than skirt border indeed a assert that be inhabited by spirit demon be clear that can not have visited to proceed to comanche country be therefore necessary that must follow rio grande till came to presidio of rio grande belonging to mexican from there cross over take road to san antonio de bejar last western city of texas proceed through texan country to where comanche be located therefore decided that must join band of apache who be proceeding towards texas during excursion apache have captured many horse arm from trading party have surprised near chihuahua with accustomed liberality furnished with

populated by more deserving class of individual might have be even by time country of importance wealth have from commencement be resort of vagabond scoundrel who must not venture to remain in united state unfortunately texan character be fixed established a community wholly destitute of principle probity before emigration of more respectable settler have commenced consequence have be most disastrous be to be questioned whether of will ever be removed at period of independence population of texas be estimated at about forty thousand now if be to credit texan government have increased to about seventy five thousand such however be not fact although of course suit member of republic to make assertion instead of increase stated by population of texas have decreased considerably be not now equal to what be at independence may appear strange after so many thousand from united state england germany have be induced to emigrate there fact be that after having arrived in country having discovered that be at mercy of band of miscreant who be capable of dark deed have quitted country to save remainder of substance have passed over into southern united state anywhere else where have chance of security for life property among population of texas be counted many thousand mexican who remained in country trusting that order law must soon be established disappointed in expectation

thence taking good to san antonio distance of about one hundred forty mile western boundary line of texas at time of declaration of independence be understood to be river nueces if so nothing must have prevented san antonio from becoming inland depot of much commercial importance numerous party of mexican trader have long be accustomed to come to san antonio from rio grande be generally very honest in payment showed very friendly spirit have trade be protected a must have be by putting down band of robber who rendered road unsafe by depredation atrocity must have become of more value than trade to santa fe recognized unrecognized texas must have carried on trade merchant must have settled in west to participate in emigrant must have collected in district where soil be rich climate healthy be true trade must have be illicit such be ever inevitable consequence of high ill regulated tariff must nevertheless have be very profitable must have conciliated population of rio grande towards texan in probability have forced upon mexican government establishment of friendly relation between two country trade have be totally destroyed indian now seize plunder caravan to from san

bearing more to west obliged to keep out distance from ravine to avoid small gully emptying into various elbow made about noon struck upon large trail running directly west followed on reaching main chasm found that led to only place where there be chance of crossing here too found that innumerable trail joined coming from direction proof conclusive that must cross here travel many weary mile out of way dismounting from animal looked at yawning abyss before first impression be that passage be impracticable that buffalo mustang very probably indian horse have crossed here be evident enough for zigzag path have be worn down rocky precipitous side three horse be unused to sliding down climbing precipice drew back on being led to brink of chasm after many unsuccessful attempt at last persuaded steed to take path others followed in place went along very verge of rocky edge where false step must have precipitated hundred of foot down to instant death in others be compelled to slide down pass nearly perpendicular gabriel horse be much bruised after hour severe toil gained bottom without sustaining serious injury here remained couple of hour to rest weary animal find trail leading up opposite side discovered after great exertion succeeded in clambering up to top where again found upon smooth level prairie on looking back shuddered to behold frightful chasm have so successfully passed thought miracle that have got safely across very short time afterwards be convinced that feat have just accomplished be mere nothing after giving animal rest resumed journey across dreary prairie not tree bush must be seen in direction green carpeting of short grass be spread over vast scene with naught else to relieve sight people may talk of solitude of forest a much a please there

good now hurried march difficult crossing of immense chasm began to tell upon at sunrise halted near small pond of water to rest animal allow hour to feed while stretched upon ground perceived large antelope slowly approaching now stopping now walking few step nearer evidently inquisitive a to who rather what might be curiosity cost life with well directed shot gabriel brought down none starved man must appreciate delight cooked best part of animal made plentiful dinner resumed journey for three day more same dreary spectacle of boundless prairie be still before not sign be visible that be bearing edge journeyed rapidly on till near middle of afternoon of third day when noticed dark spot mile half ahead of at first thought to be low bush a gradually neared have more appearance of rock although nothing of kind have be seen from time first came on prairie with exception of at chasm buffalo cried roche whose keen eye at last penetrated mystery buffalo lying down asleep here then be chance for making good meal felt courage invigorated gabriel went ahead on foot with rifle in hope that must at least get near enough to wound animal while roche made preparation for chase disencumbering horse of pound of superfluous weight started for sport rendered doubly exciting by memory of recent suffering from starvation for mile beyond where buffalo lay prairie rose gradually knew nothing of nature of ground beyond gabriel crept till within hundred fifty yard of animal now began to move show sign of uneasiness gabriel gave shot evidently hit rose from ground whisked long tail looked for moment inquiringly about still kept position few hundred yard from gabriel who reloaded piece shot followed buffalo again lashed side then started off at rapid gallop directly towards sun evidently wounded not seriously hurt roche started in pursuit keeping close together until have nearly reached top of distant rise in prairie here horse being of superior mettle passed that of roche on reaching summit found buffalo still galloping rapidly at quarter of mile distance descent of prairie be very gradual must plainly see object within five mile now applied spur to horse who dashed madly down declivity giving one look behind saw that roche at least horse have entirely given up chase prairie be comparatively smooth although dared not to spur horse to full speed be soon alongside of huge animal be bull of largest size bright glaring eyeball peering out from shaggy frontlet of hair showed plainly that be maddened by wound hot pursuit be with greatest difficulty so fierce did buffalo look must get horse within twenty yard of when fired one of pistol at distance ball did not take effect a chase progressed horse came to work more kindly soon appeared to take great interest in exciting race let fall back little then by dashing spur deep into side brought up directly alongside within three four yard of infuriated beast fired other pistol buffalo shrank a ball struck just behind long hair on shoulder be under such headway when fired be obliged to pas animal cutting across close to head then again dropping behind at moment lost rifle have nothing left bow

tenanted by two frenchman missionary of name of tonti have descended that river full of grief at not finding la salle have established post near arkansas a reader may perceive there be not much difference between printed record tradition of comanche chapter xxv be during convalescence that fate of texan expedition to santa fe be decided a real fact have be studiously concealed intelligence gained from indian who be disinterested party be afterwards fully corroborated by irish gentleman who have be persuaded to join may a well relate here assuming character of friendly trader with hundred dollar worth of good a blind to real intention be to surprise mexican during neutrality have be agreed upon about five hundred men be collected at austin for expedition although report be everywhere circulated that be to be trading experiment expedition when quitted austin certainly wore very different appearance men have be supplied with uniform general colonel major be dashing about in direction quitted capital of texas with drum beating colour flying deceived by texan few respectable european be induced to join expedition for scientific research desire to visit new unexplored country under such protection little imagining that have associated with large band of robber for other name can be given to lawless plunderer if force made tolerable appearance on quitting capital few hour march put end to discipline restraint although country abounded with game be killed from mere wantonness such be improvidence that be obliged to resort to salt pork other provision a in thirty day forty large cask of whisky be consumed be easy to suppose be indeed fact that night that halted camp be scene of drunkenness riot during last few day of march through game country killed more than hundred buffalo yet three day after have quitted prairie have entered dreary northern desert have provision left be compelled to eat worn out miserable horse true account of horrible suffering must beggar description became so weak utterly helpless dozen mexican well mounted must have destroyed yet miserable a be under necessity of conciliating indian must not forego piratical thieving propensity fell upon small village of wakoes whose warrior hunter be absent not satisfied with taking away eatable must carry amused with firing indian store shooting child did not leave until village be reduced to heap of burning ash act of cowardice sealed fate of expedition be so constantly harassed by wakoe warrior have lost already so many scalp afterwards meeting with small party of mexican surrendered to that might escape well deserved unrelenting vengeance of warlike wakoes such be fate of texan expedition there be portion of history have be much talked of in united state mean history of captivity suffering while on road from santa fe to mexico mr daniel webster hath made government question mr pakenham british ambassador in mexico have employed influence of own position to restore to freedom half dozen of englishman who have joined expedition of course knew nothing of circumstance except from report of texan now be just that mexican version must be heard also latter be true one at least so far a can judge by what saw what heard upon spot from mexican document yet in possession day before capture texan who for last thirteen day have suffered pang of hunger came suddenly upon flock of several thousand sheep belonging to mexican government a usual flock be under charge of mexican family living in small covered waggon in must remove from spot to spot shifting pasture ground a required in country very few individual be employed to keep largest herd of animal be always accompanied by number of noble dog appear to be particularly adapted to protect guide animal dog run about never bark bite on contrary will walk gently up to one of flock happens to stray take carefully by ear lead back to companion sheep show least fear of dog be there occasion for useful guardian be cross of newfoundland st bernard breed of very large size very sagacious now if texan have asked for hundred sheep for money in barter sheep be worth about sixpence must have be supplied directly a soon a flock be perceived one of texan leader exclaimed with oath mexican property welcome booty upon boy upon mercy one of poor mexican who have charge be shot through head others succeeded in escaping by throwing down among thick rank of affrighted animal till out of rifle distance then began carnage without discrimination texan never ceased firing until prairie be for mile covered with body of victim yet grand victory be not purchased without severe loss for dog defended property intrusted to care scorned to run away before must all be killed have torn to piece dozen of texan dreadfully lacerated a many more evening be of course spent in revelry danger fatigue delay vexation of march be now considered over high be anticipation of rich plunder in perspective be only feat accomplished by texan expedition mexican have not be deceived have have intelligence of real nature of expedition advanced party have be sent out to announce approach twenty four hour after have regaled with mutton one of party amounting to about one hundred men made appearance excitement of previous evening have evaporated texan sent out flag of truce three hundred of surrendered unconditionally to small mexican force on one point european nation have be much deceived be a to character of mexican soldier who appears to be looked upon with degree of contempt be great mistake have arisen from false report unfounded aspersion of texan a to result of many of engagement can boldly assert although opposed to that there be not braver individual in world than mexican in opinion far superior to texan although probably not equal to in knowledge use of firearm one great cause of mexican army having occasionally met with defeat be that mexican who be of oldest best castile blood retain pride of spanish race to absurd degree son of old nobility be appointed a officer learn nothing know nothing of military tactic know how to die bravely be battle of st jacinta decided separation of texas have be greatly cried up by texan fact be be battle at mexican be commanded by santa anna who have great military talent mexican reposed full confidence in santa anna feeling very unwell went to farm house at small distance to recover be captured by dozen texan robber who took on to texan army loss of general with knowledge that there be one fit to supply place dispirited mexican retreated since time have proved to texan how insecure be even at moment england other european government have thought proper very hastily to recognize texas mexico have not will not expedition to santa fe by texan broke peace occurred in autumn of mexican army entered texas in spring of sweeping everything before from san antonio de bejar to colorado texan have sent emissary to yucatan to induce province to declare independence war in yucatan obliged mexican army to march back in direction to quell insurrection did then returned to texas again took possession of san antonio de bejar in september of same year taking many prisoner of consequence away with be intention of mexican to have returned to texas in spring of year fresh disturbance in yucatan prevented santa anna from executing project texas be therefore by mean secure population be decreasing who have respectability attached to character have left hardly need observe that texan national debt now amounting to thirteen million of dollar may for many reason turn out to be not very profitable investment footnote perhaps english reader will find extraordinary that santa anna once freed from captivity must not have re entered texas with overwhelming force reason be very simple bustamente be rival of santa anna for presidency general absence allowed to intrigue when news reached capital that santa anna have fallen prisoner became necessary to elect new president bustamente have never be very popular having promised to american population of seaport that nothing must be attempted against texas if be elected through mercantile interest supported not only with influence also with money when at last santa anna returned to mexico power be lost design upon texas be discarded by successor bustamente be man entirely devoid of energy looked with apathy upon numerous aggression made by texan upon border of mexico a soon however a mexican heard that texan in spite of law of nation have sent expedition to santa fe at very time that be making overture for peace recognition of independence called upon bustamente to account for culpable want of energy believing secure against revolution president answered with harsh measure soldiery now exasperated put santa anna at head forcing to re assume presidency bustamente ran away to paris santa fe expedition be soon defeated a have seen president santa anna began dictatorship with invasion of texas march to return to santa fe expedition texan be deprived of arm conducted to small village called anton chico till order must have be received a to future disposition from general armigo governor of province be not to be supposed that in small village of about one hundred government shepherd several hundred famished men must be supplied with necessary superfluity of life texan accuse mexican of having starved in anton chico forgetting that texan have same ration of provision a mexican soldier of course texan now attempted to fall back upon original falsehood that be trading expedition have be destroyed plundered by indian unfortunately assault upon sheep cowardly massacre of shepherd be not to be got over a governor armigo very justly observed to if be trader have committed murder if be not trader be prisoner of war after painful journey of four month prisoner arrived in old capital of mexico

forest in such such spot where two road cross other where old oak have be blasted by lightning boy grows to manhood family tradition be deeply engraved in memory when alone in solitude near haunted place morbid imagination embodies phantom of diseased brain wonder then that such men must tamely yield to superior will of one like joe smith who to knowledge wanders alone by moon light in solitude

with malignant look said ' care who devil belongs to will not have ' col nahum howard chapter xxxix must pas over many detail interesting in too long to insert in work must suffice to say that after time joe smith stated that have possession of golden plate have received from heaven pair of spectacle by mean of unknown character must be decyphered by may appear strange that such absurd assertion must be credited reader must call to mind credence given in country to joanna southcote infatuation displayed by proselyte to very last origin of mormonism deserves peculiar examination from success have attended imposture prospect have of becoming firmly established a new creed at first organization took place at time that golden plate be translating reader may suppose be nothing more than

university privilege asked for be very extensive such be desire to secure political support that be granted for mere asking indeed leader of american legislature seemed to vie with other in sycophancy towards body of fanatical stranger so anxious be party to do favour must secure gratitude tended to produce jealousy in mind of neighbouring citizen fear be expressed lest body so united religiously politically might become dangerous to liberal institution mormon have at election voted in body with leader alone made formidable legion of mormon have be amply supplied with arm by state whole body be under strictest military discipline fact together with complaint similar to be made in missouri tended to arouse strong feeling against at last in early part of summer of citizen of illinois

proclamation have be obeyed to great extent strange to say hundred have be flocking in from great manufacturing city of england what be to be result of be impossible to tell one thing be certain that in political point of view mormon be already powerful that object of smith be evidently to collect follower into one focus thus concentrate power wealth design of smith coadjutor at time of first publication of book of mormon be doubtlessly nothing more than pecuniary aggrandizement believe expected at time so many must ever be duped to be converted when however delusion began to spread publisher saw door opened not only for wealth also for extensive power history throughout show that have not be remiss in effort to acquire extent of desire be now by mean limited for writing action show design to pursue same path attain same end by same mean a did mahomet idea of second mahomet arising in nineteenth century may excite smile when consider step now taken by mormon to concentrate

mentioned remained in depository until when be found by joseph smith jun who be directed in discovery by angel of lord on plate be certain hieroglyphic said to be of egyptian character smith by direction of god being instructed by inspiration a to meaning proceeded to translate will be here proper to remark that narrative so extraordinary a contained in book of mormon translated from hieroglyphic of even most learned have limited knowledge that too by ignorant man who pretended to other knowledge of character than what derived from inspiration requires more than ordinary evidence to substantiate will therefore be purpose to inquire into nature degree of testimony have be given to world to substantiate claim of extraordinary book in first place existence of plate have ever since alleged discovery be in dispute on point must be extremely easy to give proof by making exhibition of to world if be so ancient a be claimed to be designed for purpose of transmitting history of people if have lain for age deposited in earth appearance must certainly indicate fact what evidence then have of existence of plate why none other than mere dictum of smith certificate of eleven other individual who say that have seen upon testimony be required to believe most extraordinary narrative now even admitting for sake of argument that witness be honest credible men yet what must be easier than for smith to deceive must not easily procure plate inscribe thereon set of character matter what exhibit to intended witness a genuine what must be easier than thus to impose on credulity weakness if be necessary to give appearance of antiquity chemical process must effect matter admit that witness be honest for six of after having made attestation to world that have seen plate left church thus contradicting that to have certified one of witness martin harris who be frequently mentioned in book of covenant who be high priest of church who be one of most infatuated of smith follower who even gave property in order to procure publication of book of mormon afterwards seceded from church smith in speaking of in connection with others said that be so far beneath contempt that notice of must be too great sacrifice for gentleman to make of mormon have said that copy of plate be presented to professor anthon gentleman standing in first rank a classical scholar that

ended in rude representation of mexican zodiac conclusion be irresistible that cunning fellow have prepared paper in question for purpose of imposing upon countryman who brought told man so without hesitation then proceeded to give history of whole affair convinced that have fallen into hand of sharper while left in great astonishment at simplicity professor also state that gave opinion in writing to man that mark on paper appeared to be merely imitation of various alphabetic character have meaning at connected with following letter received relative to occupation of joe smith a

black sheep must be taken on ground where treasure be concealed that after cutting throat must be led around circle while bleeding being done wrath of evil spirit must be appeased treasure must then be obtained share of must be four fold to gratify curiosity let have sheep afterwards informed that sheep be killed pursuant to commandment a there be mistake in process did not have desired effect believe be only time ever made money digging profitable business however have constantly around worthless gang whose employment be to dig for money at night who during day have more to do with mutton than money when found that better class of people of vicinity must no longer put faith in scheme for digging money then pretended to find gold bible of said book of mormon be only introduction latter book be at length fitted for press mean be taken by individual to suppress publication one apprehended danger from book originating with individual who have influence honesty honour two joseph hiram promised to show plate after book of mormon be translated afterwards pretended to have received express commandment forbidding to show plate respecting manner of obtaining translating book of mormon statement be always discordant elder joseph must say that have seen plate that knew to be gold at other time must say looked like gold at other time asserted have not seen plate at have thus briefly stated few of fact in relation to conduct character of family of smith probably sufficient have be stated without going into detail william stafford following be curious document from one of very individual who printed mormon bible having noticed in late number of sign of time notice of work entitled beormon delusion monstrosity occurred to that might perhaps be of service to cause of truth to state one circumstance relative to authenticity of book of mormon occurred during publication at time be engaged in office where be printed became familiar with men principle through whose agency be 'got up ' circumstance alluded to be a follows have heard much said by martin man who paid for printing only one in concern worth property about wonderful wisdom of translator of mysterious plate resolved to test wisdom accordingly after putting one sheet in type laid aside told harris be lost there must be serious defection in book in consequence unless sheet like original must be produced announcement threw old gentleman into great excitement after few moment reflection said must try to obtain after two three week sheet be produced more like original than other sheet of paper must have be written over by common schoolboy after having read a have manuscript preceding succeeding lost sheet a might be expected disclosure of trick greatly annoyed author caused little merriment among who be acquainted with circumstance a be none of christian only laboured for 'gold that perisheth ' did not care for delusion only so far a to be careful to avoid enjoy hoax not one of hand in office where wonderful book be printed ever became convert to system although writer of be often assured by harris that if did not must be destroyed in tn tucker groton may chapter xliii let now examine into political view of mormon follow smith in lofty aspiring vision of sovereignty for future be rogue swindler one can doubt yet there be something grand in composition joe mean miserable half starved money digger of western new york be a have before observed cast in mould of conqueror out of same clay nature have employed for creation of mahomet first struggle be successful greater portion of follower surrounded in kirkland acknowledged power a of god right hand while many individual from among better class repaired to attracted by ascendancy of bold genius by expectation of obtaining share in fame power glory kirkland however be inland place there on side smith have to contend with opposition power be confined plan have not sufficient room for development turned mind towards western border of missouri be thought with rapid action be a much natural consequence of thought a thunder be of lightning examine into topography of country holy zion promised land of mormon will be easy to recognize fixed unchangeable view of smith a connected with formation of vast empire for last twelve fifteen year government of united state have through mistaken policy be constantly engaged in sending to western border eastern indian tribe be disposed to sell land also various tribe who having rebelled against cowardly despotism have be overpowered conquered during struggle gross want of policy be obvious surrounded demoralized by white men indian fall into complete state of decadence abrutissement witness choctaw tribe that hover constantly about mobile new orleans winnibegoes who have of late come into immediate contact with settler of wisconsin pottawatomies on shore of lake michigan miami of north indiana many more on contrary tribe on border in wilderness be on increase of course there be few exception such a kanzas poor mandans who have lately be almost entirely swept away from earth by small pox of smaller tribe may be destroyed by warfare may incorporate with others thus lose name nationality increase of indian population be considerable among great uncontrolled nation such a chippewa dahcotahs sioux of north united state comanche pawnee on boundary even in very heart of texas shoshone snake on southern limit of oregon brave apache of sonora bold bedouin of mexican desert who constantly on horseback wander in immense phalanx from eastern shore of gulf of california to very water of rio grande admitting therefore a fact that tribe on border do increase in same ratio with material strength grows also invincible stern unchangeable hatred towards american in fact more le have be ill treated abused additional outrage to one tribe be locked up in memory of who wait for moment of retaliation revenge in wisconsin war black hawk even after poor starved warrior have surrendered by treaty after noble struggle more than two hundred old men woman child be forced by american to cross river without boat canoe poor thing endeavoured to pas with help of horse river there be more than mile broad while unfortunate be struggling for life against current of nine mile hour be shot in water fact be known to tribe even to comanche who be so distant have satisfied a to what may expect from who thus violate treaty faith remainder of brave tribe be now dwelling on west border of iowa wrong be too deeply dyed with own blood to be forgotten even by generation cause be ready to be espoused by tribe even who have be hereditary enemy for what be after history history of almost indian nation transplanted on other side of mississippi belt of indian tribe therefore be rather unsafe neighbour especially in event of civil war of contest with england having by mistaken policy collected together cordon of offended warrior united state will day deplore when too late former greediness cruelty towards natural owner of vast territory be among tribe joe smith wish to lay foundation of future empire settling at independence be interposing a neutral force between two opponent who must of have purchased massive strength effective energy with gift of supremacy over immense wealthy territory a have seen chance fortune of war have thrown smith mormon back on eastern shore of mississippi opposite entrance of desmoines river when forced back mormon be unruly turbulent crowd without mean military tactic now such be not case already prophet have sent able agent over river sac fox same tribe have just spoken of a much abused nation of wisconsin actually residing at about eighty mile nnw from nauvoo besides many others be on good understanding with latter day saint few bold apostle of mormonism have also gone to far far west among unconquered tribe of prairie to organize offensive power ever ready for action thus link after link smith extends influence be already felt in illinois in iowa in missouri at washington at very foot of rocky mountain moreover hundred of mormon without avowing creed have gone to texas established there save crop have numerous cattle drove of horse undoubtedly to feed sustain mormon army on future invasion let now examine further into cunning long sighted policy will admire great genius presides over be not one of so common in day who have adopted nil admirari for motto genius well ill guided be still genius if load with shame former life of smith present abominable religious imposition still be bound to do justice to conquering spirit can form such vast idea work such multitude to will population of texas doe not amount to seventy thousand soul among whom there be twenty five different form of religion two third of inhabitant be scoundrel who have there sought refuge against offended law of country be not only curse check to civilization reflect dishonour upon remaining third portion of texan who have come from distant clime for honest purpose of trade agriculture mongrel mixed congregation of being though firmly united in one point war with mexico that in expectation of rich plunder be continually at variance on other point three thousand texan must fight against mexico not two hundred against mormon for many reason government alone not individual must be gainer by victory in texas not soul care for anything besides mormon be yankee can handle rifle setting aside good drilling excellent discipline in number must also have advantage while be now writing can muster five thousand well drilled soldier in event of invasion of texas must easily march ten thousand men from sabine to rio grande from red river to gulf of mexico opposition will not meet year after capture whole of texas becomes mormon while joe king emperor pharaoh judge regenerator rule over host of two hundred fifty thousand devoted subject let reader observe that be not wild utopia of heated imagination speak a do believe intercourse with mormon during travel have be sufficiently close to give clear insight into design for future joe policy be above to conciliate indian once done there will not be in america power capable of successfully opposing in order to assist join in new faith in admitting indian to be right though guilty descendant of sacred tribe flatters with acknowledgment of antiquity only point on white can captivate even blind shrewd though untutored man of wild in explanation of plan proceeding of joe smith mormon may not be amiss to make remark upon locality have designed a seat of empire dominion where have already established follower a destined instrument of ambition according to mormon prophet whole region of country between rocky mountain alleghanies be at period of about thirteen hundred year ago densely peopled by nation descended from jewish family who emigrated from jerusalem in time of prophet jeremiah six seven hundred year before christ immense city be founded sumptuous edifice reared whole land overspread with result of high extensive civilization book of mormon speaks of city with stupendous stone wall of battle in hundred of thousand be slain land afterwards became waste howling wilderness traversed by few straggling band tribe of savage descended from branch of aforesaid jewish family who in consequence of wickedness have complexion changed from white to red emigrant from europe descendant having filled land god having be pleased to grant revelation by be made known true history of past in america event be about to take place have also commanded saint of latter day to assemble together there occupy land be once held by member of true church state of missouri illinois territory of iowa be region to prophet have hitherto chiefly directed scheme of aggrandizement be to form nucleus of mormon empire remaining state be to be licked up like salt fall before sweeping falchion of glorious prophetic dominion like defenceless lamb before mighty king of forest have given result of note taken relative to mormon not perhaps in very chronological order a gathered from time to time reader will agree with that subject be well worth attention absurd ridiculous a creed may be creed ever in so short period obtained so many such devoted proselyte from information have since received may now amount to three hundred thousand have wealth energy unity have everything in favour federal government have be so long passive that doubt if have power to disperse indeed to obtain political support have received so many advantage may say such assistance that be now so strong that attempt to wrest from privilege have be conceded must be signal for general rising have fortified nauvoo can turn out disciplined force a large a state be likely to oppose to if successful can always expect co operation of seventy thousand indian if defeated retreat among will enable to coalesce for more fortunate opportunity of action do imagine that loss of leader joe smith must now much affect strength there be plenty to replace equally capable not perhaps to have formed confederacy religious political have done to uphold now that be so strong united state appear to to be just now in most peculiar state of progression very soon eye of whole world will be directed towards result of institution change be about to take place what that change will be be difficult to say few year will decide question chapter xliv having now related principal event witnessed in be actor in california in texas a country be

a animal always wander alone with exception of wolf from whom however there be little to fear a in prairie animal be always glutted with food timid at approach of man a prairie wolf be entirely different from european will borrow page of ross cox who having have opportunity of meeting give very good description of manner way of living yet a traveller doe not describe animal will add that general colour of prairie wolf be grey mixed with black ear be round straight be about forty inch long posse sagacity cunning of fox prairie wolf say cox be much smaller than inhabit wood generally

call robinson tell will trouble to forget to go to sleep again a did last time leave here kicking heel contrary to rule regulation of service chapter xiv first lieutenant have more patient mr chuck boatswain let into secret of gentility before proceed with narrative wish to explain to reader that history be not written in after life when have obtained greater knowledge of world when first went to sea promised mother must keep journal of what passed with reflection upon to promise rigidly adhered since have be own master journal have remained in possession in writing therefore early part of adventure everything be stated a be impressed on mind at time upon many point have since have reason to form different opinion from be recorded upon many others have since laughed heartily at folly simplicity still have thought advisable to let idea of period remain rather than correct by of dear bought experience boy of fifteen brought up in secluded country town can not be expected to reason judge a young man who have seen much of life passed through variety of adventure reader must therefore remember have referred to journal for opinion feeling guided between distinct anniversary of existence have now be cruising for six week found that profession be much more agreeable than have anticipated desire to please be taken for deed although occasionally made blunder yet captain first lieutenant seemed to think be attentive to duty to best of ability only smiled at mistake also discovered that however natural capacity may have be estimated by family that be not so depreciated here day felt more confidence in hoped by attention diligence to make up for want of natural endowment there certainly be something in life of sailor enlarges mind when be at home six month before allowed other people to think for acted wholly on leading string of suggestion on board to best of ability thought for became happy with messmate who be harsh upon left off because never resented conduct who be kind to be even kinder than before time flew away quickly suppose because knew exactly what have to do day be forerunner of ensuing first lieutenant be one of most amusing men ever knew yet never relaxed from discipline of service took least liberty with superior inferior humour be principally shown in various mode of punishment however severe punishment be to party manner of inflicting be invariably source of amusement to remainder of ship company often thought that although individual liked being punished yet that ship company be quite pleased when punishment took place be very particular about deck be always a white a snow nothing displeased so much a being soiled be for reason that have such objection to use of tobacco there be spitting pan placed in different part of deck for use of men that might not dirty plank with tobacco juice sometimes man in hurry forgot to use pan a mess to stain might be opposite have grog stopped if party be not found out took good care not only to keep look out to inform against offender now punishment for offence be a follows man hand be tied behind back large tin spitting box fixed to chest by strap over shoulder other box on lower deck be taken away be obliged to walk there ready to attend summons of man who might wish to empty mouth of tobacco juice other men be so pleased at fancy that spat twice a much a before for pleasure of making run about mr chuck boatswain called first lieutenant perambulating spitting pan observed to one day really mr falcon be such epicure about deck that be afraid to pudding anchor on forecastle be much amused one morning watch kept be stowing hammock in quarter deck netting when one of boy came up with hammock on shoulder a passed first lieutenant latter perceived that have quid of tobacco in cheek what have got there good lad gum boil cheek be very much swelled sir replied boy there be nothing at matter o there must be be bad tooth then open mouth let see very reluctantly boy opened mouth discovered large roll of tobacco leaf see see said first lieutenant mouth want overhauling teeth cleaning wish have dentist on board a have not will operate a well a can send armourer up here with tongs when armourer made appearance boy be made to open mouth while chaw of tobacco be extracted with rough instrument there now said first lieutenant be sure that must feel better already never must have have appetite now captain of afterguard bring piece of old canvas sand here clean teeth nicely captain of afterguard came forward putting boy head between knee scrubbed teeth well with sand canvas for two three minute there will do said first lieutenant now little fellow mouth be nice clean will enjoy breakfast be impossible for to have eaten anything with mouth in such nasty state when be dirty again come to will be dentist one day be on forecastle with mr chuck boatswain who be very kind to have be showing how to make various knot bend of rope be used in service be afraid be very stupid showed over over again until learnt how to make amongst others taught fisherman bend pronounced to be king of knot mr simple continued there be moral in knot observe that when part be drawn right way together more pull faster hold more impossible to untie see by hauling apart how little difference pull other way immediately disunites then how easy cast off in moment point out necessity of pulling together in world mr simple when wish to hold on be piece of philosophy worth twenty six thousand odd year of friend carpenter lead to nothing brown study when ought to be attending to duty very true mr chuck be better philosopher of two be better educated mr simple trust more of gentleman consider gentleman to be to certain degree philosopher for very often be obliged to support character a such to put up with what person may very properly fly in passion about think coolness be great character stick of gentleman in service mr simple one be obliged to appear angry without indulging sentiment can assure that never lose temper even when use rattan why then mr chuck do swear so much at men surely be not gentlemanly most certainly not sir must defend by observing very artificial state in live on board of man of war necessity dear mr simple have law must observe how gently always commence when have to find fault do to prove gentility sir zeal for service obliges to alter language to prove in end be in earnest nothing must afford more pleasure than to be able to carry on duty a gentleman be impossible really can not see why perhaps then mr simple will explain to why captain first lieutenant swear pretend to answer only do so upon emergency exactly so sir beergency be daily hourly duty in continual working of ship be answerable for go amiss life of boatswain be life of beergency therefore swear still can not allow to be requisite certainly be sinful excuse dear sir be absolutely requisite not at sinful there be one language for pulpit for on board ship in situation man must make use of term most likely to produce necessary effect upon listener whether be from long custom of service from indifference of sailor to common thing language ca exactly explain mr simple know what mean perhaps constant excitement may do therefore requires more betimilis a call to make move certain be that common parlancy wo do with common seaman be not here a in scripture doeth ' by bye chap must have have soldier in tight order be 'do d n eye then be done directly order to do just carry weight of cannon shot want perpelling power d n be gunpowder set flying in execution of duty do comprehend mr simple perfectly understand mr chuck can not help remarking that without flattery that be very different from rest of warrant officer where did receive education mr simple be here boatswain with clean shirt say one dare gainsay also with thorough knowledge of duty although say that ever be better off can say have be in best society in company of lord lady once dined with grandfather be more than ever did for never asked took least notice of replied what state be true did not know that be grandfather until yesterday when be talking with mr o'brien perfectly recollect although be very young at time now mr simple if will promise a gentleman know be one that will not repeat what tell then will let into history of life mr chuck a be gentleman never will divulge until be dead buried not then if wish when be dead buried may do a please may then be of service to other people although story be not very long one mr chuck then sat down upon fore end of boom by funnel took place by side when commenced a follows father be boatswain before one of old school rough a bear drunken a gosport fiddler mother be mother will say no more father be invalided for harbour duty after life of intoxication died shortly afterwards in meantime have be by kindness of port admiral wife educated at foundation school be thirteen when father died mother not knowing what to do with wished to bind apprentice to merchant vessel refused after six month quarrelling on subject decided point by volunteering in narcissus frigate believe that gentlemanly idea be innate mr simple never a child must bear idea of merchant service after have be week on board be appointed servant to purser where gave such satisfaction by alertness dexterity that first lieutenant took away from purser to attend upon so that in two month be person of such consequence a to create disturbance in gunroom for purser be very angry many of officer took part be whispered that be son of first lieutenant that be aware of how far may be true know not there be likeness between mother who be very pretty woman attended ship many year before a bumboat girl ca pretend to say anything about do say mr simple many will blame for ca help natural feeling have rather be bye blow of gentleman than 'gitimate offspring of boatswain wife there be chance of good blood in vein in latter instance whereas in former may have stolen drop two so happened that after have served first lieutenant for about year young lord must not mention name mr simple be sent to sea by friend by own choice know be told that uncle who be 'zeckative have interest in death persuaded to go lord at period twenty five year ago be rarity in service used to salute when came on board consequence be that young lord must have servant to although rest of midshipman have one servant between captain inquired who be best boy in ship purser to whom appealed recommended accordingly much to annoyance of first lieutenant for first lieutenant in day did not assume a do now not that refer to mr falcon who be gentleman be immediately surrendered to lordship have very easy comfortable life of did little nothing if inquired for when hand be turned up be cleaning lordship boot brushing lordship clothes there be nothing to be said when lordship name be mentioned went to mediterranean because lordship mamma wished have be there about year when lordship ate so many grape that be seized with dysentery be ill for three week then requested to be sent to malta in transport going to gibraltar rather to barbary coast for bullock became worse day made will leaving effect on board certainly deserved for kindness with have nursed off malta fell in with xebeque bound to civita vecchia captain of transport anxious to proceed advised going on board of a wind be light contrary mediterranean vessel sailed better on wind than transport master who be now sinking fast consented changed ship next day died gale of wind came on prevented from gaining port for several day body of lordship not only became so offensive affected superstition of catholic sailor so much that be hove overboard none of people must speak english must speak maltese have idea who be have plenty of time for cogitation have often thought what fine thing be to be lord a often wished that have be born one wind be still against when merchant vessel ran down to have left civita vecchia for gibraltar desired captain of xebeque to make signal of distress rather did vessel proved to be english bore down to manned boat to go on board idea came into head that although might refuse to take must not refuse lord put on midshipman uniform belonging to lordship then certainly belonging to went alongside of merchant vessel told that have left ship for benefit of health wanted passage to gibraltar on way home title immediate acceptance of term demanded for passage be sufficient property be brought from xebeque of course a must not speak english must not contradict even if suspected here mr simple must acknowledge slight flaw in early history impart to in confidence otherwise must not have be able to prove be correct in asserting have dined with grandfather temptation be too strong must not resist think mr simple after having served a ship boy clouted here kicked there damned by one sent to hell by to find treated with such respect deference lorded lorded that minute of day during passage to gibraltar have plenty of time for arranging plan hardly need say that lord kit be valuable what be better exactly fitted also have watch trinket many other thing besides bag of dollar however be honestly mine only thing that took be name have further occasion for poor fellow be use defending what be wrong be dishonest there be end of now observe mr simple how one thing lead to declare to that first idea of making use of lordship name be to procure passage to gibraltar then be undecided how to act a have charge of paper letter to mother guardian think indeed be almost sure must have laid aside dignity midshipman dress applied for passage home to commissioner of yard be fated to be otherwise for master of transport went on shore to report obtain pratique told everywhere that young lord be passenger with going to england for benefit of health in le than hour off came commissioner boat boat from governor requesting honour of company must take bed at house during stay what must do began to be frightened be more afraid to confess be impostor for be sure master of transport alone must have kicked overboard if have let know that have be so confounded polite to ship boy so blushed half from modesty half from guilt accepted invitation of governor sending polite verbal refusal to commissioner upon plea of there being paper pen on board have so often accompanied late master knew very well how to conduct have borrowed good deal of air appearance indeed have natural taste for gentility must write read not perhaps so well a ought to have done considering education have received still quite well enough for lord indeed much better than late master knew signature well enough although very idea of being forced to use made tremble however die be cast ought to observe in one point be not unlike have curly light hair blue eye in other point there be resemblance be by far better looking chap of two a have be up mediterranean for two year have fear of doubt a to identity until arrived in england well mr simple dressed very carefully put on chain ring little perfume on handkerchief accompanied aide de camp to governor where be

five minute before came up be be shoved up for be so heavy that must not get up without assistance know how elephant in india push cannon through morass with head from behind well steward used to shove up companion ladder just in same way with head completely buried in petticoat a soon a be up used to pull head out looking a red hot a fresh boiled lobster well up came with will in hand looking

lady kept word never made will proved one have recovered at doctor common touched whole of money a first lieutenant must prove whether story be true not of course expressed congratulation at good fortune soon afterwards left cabin to report marvellous story to messmate when went on deck found that shark have just be hooked be hauling on board mr phillott have also come on deck officer be eager about shark be looking over side calling to other giving direction to men now although certainly there be want of decorum on quarter deck still captain having given permission be to be excused mr phillott thought otherwise commenced in usual style beginning with marine officer mr westley will trouble not to be getting upon hammock will get off directly sir if one of fellow be to do so 'd stop grog for month see why be to set bad example have be too long in barrack sir by half who be that mr williams mr moore on hammock too up to foretopmast head of directly mr thomas up to main say youngster stealing off perch upon spanker boom let know when have rode to london by god service be going to hell know what officer be made of now day will marry of young gentleman to gunner daughter before long quarter deck better than bear garden wonder when lieutenant set example latter remark must only be applied to o'brien who stood in quarter boat giving direction before tirade of mr phillott stopped amusement of party o'brien immediately stepped out of boat going up to mr phillott touched hat said mr phillott have captain permission to catch shark shark be not to be got on board by walking up down on quarter deck a regard a long a captain be on board hold responsible to alone for conduct if think have done wrong forward complaint if pretend to use such language to a have to others will hold responsible be here sir a officer gentleman will be treated a such allow to observe consider quarter deck more disgraced by foul ungentlemanly language than do by officer accidentally standing upon hammock however a have thought proper to interfere may now get shark on board mr phillott turned very red for never have come in contact in way with o'brien other officer have submitted quietly to unpleasant manner of speaking to very well mr o'brien will hold answerable for language replied will most certainly report conduct to captain will save trouble captain kearney be now coming up will report o'brien did upon captain putting foot on quarter deck well observed captain to mr phillott what be complain of mr o'brien language sir be to be addressed on quarter deck in manner really must say mr phillott replied captain kearney perceive anything in what mr o'brien said what be correct command here if officer so nearly equal in rank to have committed be not to take law into own hand fact be mr phillott language be not quite so correct a must wish overheard word that passed consider that have treated superior officer with disrespect be gave permission that shark must be caught with permission consequently allowed little deviation from discipline of service must inevitably take place yet have thought proper to interfere with permission be tantamount to order have made use of harsh language punished young gentleman for obeying injunction will oblige sir by calling down in restraining petulance for future will always support authority when be correct regret that in instance have necessitated to weaken be most severe check to mr phillott who immediately went below after hailing masthead calling down midshipman a soon a be gone be on hammock again shark be hauled forward hoisted on board frying pan in ship be in requisition be all much pleased with captain kearney conduct on occasion a o'brien observed to really be good fellow clever officer what thousand pity be that be such confounded liar must do mr phillott justice to say that bore malice on occasion treated a before be saying great deal in favour when be considered what power first lieutenant have of annoying punishing inferior chapter xxxiii set to between captain first lieutenant cutting out expedition mr chuck mistaken dy like gentleman swinburne begin account of battle off st vincent have not be more than week under danish island of st thomas when discovered brig close in shore made sail in chase soon came within mile half of shore when anchored under battery opened fire upon elevation be too great several shot passed over between mast once met with very remarkable circumstance observed captain kearney three gun be fired at frigate be on board of from battery at same time three shot cut away three topsail tie down came topsail yard upon cap at same time that frenchman might not suppose that have taken such good aim turned up hand to reef topsail by time that men be off yard tie be spliced topsail run up again mr phillott must not stand most enormous fib replied very odd indeed captain kearney have known stranger circumstance have put in powder to four gun on main deck when be fighting danish gun boat in frigate be in a men withdrew rammer shot from enemy entered muzzle completed loading of gun fired own shot back upon occurred three time running upon word replied captain kearney who have glass upon battery think must have dreamt circumstance mr phillott not more than did about topsail tie captain kearney captain kearney at time have long glass in hand holding up over shoulder shot from battery whizzed over head took glass out of hand shivering to piece be once said captain kearney very coolly will pretend that must ever happen three time running might take head off arm next time not glass whereas topsail tie might be cut by three different shot give glass mr simple be certain that vessel be privateer what think mr o'brien be bit of opinion captain kearney replied o'brien think must be very pretty bit of practice to ship company to take out from under footy battery starboard helm mr phillott keep away four point then will think of to night frigate be now kept away ran out of fire of battery be then about hour before sunset in west indie sun doe not set a doe in northern latitude there be twilight descends in glory surrounded with cloud of gold ruby in gorgeous tint once below horizon be dark a soon a be dark hauled wind off shore consultation being held between captain mr phillott o'brien captain at last decided that attempt must be made indeed although cutting out be very serious affair a combat under disadvantage still mischief done to trade by fast sailing privateer be so great in west indie that almost sacrifice be warrantable for interest of country still captain kearney although brave prudent officer one who calculated chance who must not risk men without deemed that necessity imperiously demanded that such must be done be averse to attack from knowledge of bay in brig be anchored although mr phillott o'brien be of opinion that must be night attack captain kearney decided otherwise considered that although risk might be greater yet force employed must be more consolidated that who must hold back in night dare not do so during day moreover that people on shore in battery a well a in privateer must be on alert night not expecting attack during day must be taken off guard be therefore directed that everything must be in preparation during night that boat must shove off before daylight row in shore concealing behind rock under cliff formed cape upon one side of harbour if not discovered remain there till noon at time be probable that privateer men must be on shore vessel might be captured without difficulty be always scene of much interest on board man of war when preparation be made for expedition of description a reader may not have be witness to may perhaps be interesting to describe boat of men of war have generally two crew common boat crew be selected so a not to take away most useful men from ship service fighting boat crew be selected from very best men on board coxswain of boat be most trustworthy men in ship on occasion have to see that boat be properly equipped launch yawl first second cutter be boat appointed for expedition carried gun mounted upon slide ran fore aft between men after boat be hoisted out gun be lowered down into shipped in bow of boat arm chest be next handed in contain cartridge ammunition shot be put into bottom of boat so far be ready oar of boat be fitted to pull with grummet upon iron thole pin that might make little noise might swing fore aft without falling overboard when boat pulled alongside privateer breaker two be small cask holding about seven gallon of water be put into boat also men allowance of spirit in case must be detained by unforeseen circumstance men belonging to boat be fully employed in looking after arm fitting flint to pistol others major part of sharpening cutlass at grindstone with file borrowed from armourer be busy merry very idea of going into action be source of joy to english sailor more joke be made more merriment excited at time than at other then a often happens that one two of service boat crew may be on sick list urgent solicitation be made by others that may supply place only party who appear at grave be who be to remain in frigate not share in expedition there be occasion to order boat to be manned for men be generally in long before be piped away indeed one must think that be party of pleasure instead of danger of death upon be about to proceed captain kearney selected officer who be to have charge of boat must not trust of midshipman on so dangerous service said that have known so many occasion in rashness foolhardiness have spoilt expedition therefore appointed mr phillott first lieutenant to launch o'brien to yawl master to first mr chuck boatswain to second cutter mr chuck be much pleased with idea of having command of boat asked to come with to consented although have intended a usual to have gone with o'brien about hour before daylight ran frigate to within mile half of shore boat shoved off frigate then wore round stood out in offing that might at daylight be at such distance a not to excite suspicion that boat be sent away while in boat pulled quietly in shore be not quarter of hour before arrived at cape forming one side of bay be well secreted among cluster of rock be underneath oar be laid in boat painter made fast order given for strictest silence rock be very high boat be not to be seen without one must come to edge of precipice even then must in probability have be supposed to have be rock water be a smooth a glass when be broad daylight men hung listlessly over side of boat looking at coral below watching fish a glided between ca say mr simple said mr chuck to in under tone think well of expedition have idea that of will lose number of mess after calm come storm how quiet be everything now will take off great coat for sun be hot already coxswain give jacket mr chuck have put on great coat not jacket underneath have left on one of gun on main deck ready to change a soon a heavy dew have gone off coxswain handed jacket mr chuck threw off great coat to put on when be opened proved that by mistake have taken away jacket surmounted by two small epaulette belonging to captain kearney captain steward who have taken out to brush have also laid upon same gun by nobility of england cried mr chuck have taken away captain jacket by mistake here be pretty mess if put on great coat will be dead with sweating if put on jacket will be roasted brown if put on captain jacket will be considered disrespectful men in boat tittered mr phillott who be in launch next to turned round to see what be matter o'brien be sitting in stern sheet of launch with first lieutenant leaned over told by power see why captain jacket will be at hurt by mr chuck putting on replied o'brien unless indeed bullet be to go through then wo be fault of mr chuck replied first lieutenant if one did captain might keep jacket swear that bullet went round body without wounding will have good yarn to spin so put on mr chuck will make good mark for enemy will stand risk of with pleasure observed boatswain to for sake of being considered gentleman so here be on with there be general laugh when mr chuck pulled on captain jacket sank down in stern sheet of cutter with great complacency of countenance one of men in boat that be in thought proper however to continue laugh little longer than mr chuck considered necessary who leaning forward thus addressed say mr webber beg leave to observe to in most delicate manner in world just to hint to that be not custom to laugh at superior officer mean just to insinuate that be d d impudent son of sea cook if live do well will prove to that if be to be laughed at in boat with captain jacket on be not to be laughed at on board frigate with boatswain rattan in fist so look out hearty for squall when come on forecastle for will be d d if make see more star than god almighty ever made cut more caper than dancing master in france mark word burgoo eating pea soup swilling trowsers scrubbing son of bitch mr chuck having at end of oration raised voice above pitch required by exigency of service be called to order by first lieutenant again sank back into stern sheet with importance authoritative show peculiarly appertaining to pair of epaulette waited behind rock until noonday without being discovered by enemy so well be concealed have already sent officer who carefully hiding by lying down on rock have several time reconnoitred enemy boat be passing repassing continually from privateer to shore appeared that went on shore full of men returned with only one two so that be in great hope that must find few men to defend vessel mr phillott looked at watch held up to o'brien to prove that have complied exactly with order have received from captain then gave word to get boat under weigh painter be cast off by bowman gun be loaded primed men seized oar in two minute be clear of rock drawn up in line within quarter of mile from harbour mouth not mile from privateer brig rowed a quickly a possible did not cheer until enemy fired first gun did from quarter unexpected a entered mouth of harbour with union jack trailing in water over stern for be dead calm appeared that at low point under cliff at side of little bay have raised water battery of two gun one of gun laden with grape shot be now fired at boat elevation be too low although water be ploughed up to within five yard of launch injury be received be equally fortunate in discharge of other three gun two of passed so quickly that be not aimed sufficiently forward so that shot fell astern other although shot fell among did further injury than cutting in half two of oar of first cutter in meantime have observed that boat have shoved off from privateer a soon a have perceived have returned to laden with men boat have be despatched second time have not yet returned be now about same distance from privateer a be boat be quite undecided of must be first on board o'brien perceiving painted out to mr phillott that must first attack boat afterwards board on side to pulled a in probability there must be opening left in boarding netting be tied up to yard arm presented formidable obstacle to success mr phillott agreed with o'brien ordered bowman to lay in oar keep gun pointed ready to fire at word given desiring other men to pull best nerve muscle be brought into play by anxious intrepid seaman when within about twenty yard of vessel also of boat order be given to fire carronade of launch poured out round grape so well directed that one of french boat sunk immediately musket ball with other smaller gun be loaded did great execution among men in one minute more with three cheer from sailor be alongside together english french boat pell mell most determined close conflict took place french fought desperately a be overpowered be reinforced by from privateer who must not look on behold companion requiring assistance without coming to aid jumped down into boat from chain into midst of men others darted cold shot at to kill to sink boat thus did one of most desperate hand to hand conflict take place that ever be witnessed be soon decided in favour for be stronger party better armed when opposition be over jumped into privateer found not man left on board only large dog who flew at o'brien throat a entered port kill said o'brien a sailor hastened to assistance only take away gripe sailor disengaged dog o'brien led up to gun saying by jasus boy be prisoner although have possession of privateer difficulty a will prove be by mean over be now exposed not only to fire of two battery at harbour mouth have to pas also to of battery at bottom of bay have fired at frigate in meantime be very busy in cutting cable lowering topsail taking wounded men on board privateer from out of boat be however work of few minute most of frenchman be killed own wounded amounted to only nine seaman mr chuck boatswain who be shot through body apparently with little chance of surviving a mr phillott observed captain epaulette have made mark for enemy have fallen in borrowed plume a soon a be on board laid on deck for there be a near a can recollect about fourteen wounded frenchman a well a own tow rope be got out forward boat be manned proceeded to tow brig out of harbour be dead calm made little way boat crew flushed with victory cheered rallied pulled with strength enemy perceiving that privateer be taken french boat drifting empty up harbour now opened fire upon with great effect before have towed abreast of two water battery have received three shot between wind water from other battery sea be pouring fast into vessel have be attending to poor mr chuck who lay on starboard side near wheel blood flowing from wound tracing course down plank of deck to distance of foot from where lay appeared very faint tied handkerchief round body so a to stop effusion of blood brought water with bathed face poured into mouth opened eye wide looked at ah mr simple said faintly be be over with must not be better must how do mean inquired why have not fallen dressed like officer gentleman said referring to captain jacket epaulette 'd sooner die now with dress on than recover to put on boatswain uniform feel quite happy pressed hand then closed eye again from weakness be now nearly abreast of two battery on point gun of have be trained so a to bear upon boat be towing out brig first shot went through bottom of launch sank fortunately men be saved a be boat towed next to brig great delay occurred in getting others clear of taking brig again in shot now poured in thick grape became very annoying still men gave way cheering at shot fired have nearly passed battery with trifling loss when perceived that brig be so full of water that must not swim many minute longer that must be impossible to tow alongside of frigate mr phillott under circumstance decided that must be useless to risk more life that wounded must be taken out of brig boat must pull away for ship desired to get wounded men into cutter sent alongside then to follow other boat made haste must not wishing to be left behind a soon a wounded men be in boat went to mr chuck to remove appeared somewhat revived must not allow to remove dear mr simple said be of use never can recover prefer dying here entreat not to move if enemy take possession of brig before sink will be buried with military honour if will at least die in dress of gentleman hasten away a fast a can before lose more men here stay be decided expostulated with at time two boat full of men appeared pulling out of harbour to brig enemy have perceived that boat have deserted be coming to take possession have therefore time to urge mr chuck to change resolution not wishing to force dying man shook hand left be with difficulty escaped for boat have come up close to brig chased little while yawl cutter turning back to assistance gave up pursuit on whole be very well arranged well conducted expedition only man lost be mr chuck for wound of others be none of mortal captain kearney be quite satisfied with conduct so be admiral when be reported to captain kearney did indeed grumble little about jacket sent for to inquire why have not taken off mr chuck brought on board a did not choose to tell exact truth replied must not disturb dying man that jacket be so saturated with blood that never must have worn again be case at event might have brought away epaulette replied youngster think of nothing gormandizing have first watch night when swinburne quarter master came up to asked particular of affair for be not in boat well said that mr chuck appeared to be very good boatswain in way if

do sir now then will tell about more about too than most can for know how action be brought about have log marked board then sat down abaft on signal chest with swinburne who commenced narrative a follows must know mr simple that when english fleet came down mediterranean after 'vackyation of corsica did not muster more than seventeen sail of line while spanish fleet from ferrol carthagena have joined company at cadiz beounted to near thirty sir john jervis have command of fleet at time a don did not seem at inclined to come out have brush with almost two to one sir john left sir hyde parker with six sail of line to watch spanish beggar while went in to lisbon with remainder of fleet to water refit now see mr simple portugal be at time what call neutral be to say did meddle at in affair being friend with party just a willing to supply fresh beef water to spaniard a to english if so be spaniard have come out to ax for dar' portuguese english have always be best of friend because ca get port wine anywhere else ca get nobody else to buy of so portuguese gave up arsenal at lisbon for use of english there kept store under charge of old dare devil sir isaac coffin now so happened that one of clerk in old sir isaac office portuguese chap have be time before in office of spanish ambassador be very smart sort of chap sarved a interpreter old commissioner put great faith in how did learn swinburne why will tell mr simple steered yawl a coxswain when admiral captain talk in stern sheet very often forget that coxswain be close behind only learnt half of way rest put together when compared log with admiral steward who of course heard great deal now then first heard of be when old sir john called out to sir isaac after second bottle say sir isaac who killed spanish messenger ' 'not by god ' replied sir isaac ' only left for dead ' then laughed so did nelson who be sitting with well mr simple be reported to sir isaac that clerk be often seen taking memorandum of different order given to fleet particularly a to there being wasteful expenditure of majesty store upon sir isaac go to admiral request that man might be discharged now old sir john be sly old fox answered 'not so commissioner perhaps may catch in own trap ' so admiral sits down call for pen ink flourish out long letter to commissioner stating that store of fleet be expended representing a how must be impossible to go to sea without supply wishing to know when commissioner expected more transport from england also said that if spanish fleet be now to come out from cadiz must be impossible for to protect sir h parker with six sail of line who be watching spanish fleet a must not quit port in present condition to letter commissioner answered that from last account thought that in course

of clerk spanish ambassador sent away two messenger one for cadiz other for madrid be town where king of spain life one to cadiz be permitted to go one to madrid be stopped by direction of admiral job be confided to commissioner sir isaac who settled somehow be reason why admiral called out to ' say sir isaac who killed messenger brought back despatch by found out that advice have be sent to spanish admiral forget name something like magazine informing of supposed crippled state of squadron sir john taking for granted that spaniard must not lose opportunity of taking six sail of line more english ship than have ever taken in life waited few day to give time then sailed from lisbon for cape st vincent where joined sir hyde parker fell in with spaniard sure enough pretty drubbing gave now be not everybody must tell mr simple well now for action swinburne lord bless mr simple be now past seven bell ca fight battle of st vincent in hour besides be well worth glass of grog to hear

xxxiv o'brien good advice captain kearney again deal in marvellous remember circumstance in life at time lay so heavily on mind a loss of poor mr chuck boatswain who of course took for granted must never see again believe that chief cause be that at time entered service one considered to be fool of family mr chuck o'brien be only two who thought of treated differently be conduct induced to apply encouraged to exertion believe that many boy who if properly patronized must turn out well be by injudicious system of browbeating ridicule forced into wrong path in despair throw away self confidence allows to be carried away by stream to perdition o'brien be not very partial to reading played german flute remarkably well have very good voice chief amusement be practising rather playing be very different thing although did not study always made come into cabin for hour two day after have read repeat to content of book by method not only instructed gained great deal of information for made so many remark upon what have read that be impressed upon memory well peter must say a came into cabin what have to tell morning sure be be schoolmaster not for learn from day have not read much o'brien to day for have be thinking of poor mr chuck very right for so to do peter never forget friend in hurry will not find too many of a trot along highway of life wonder whether be dead why be question can not answer bullet through chest lengthen man day be certain know that will not die if can help now that be got captain jacket on yes always aspired to be gentleman be absurd enough in boatswain not at absurd peter very absurd of to talk without thinking when did one of shipmate ever know mr chuck to do unhandsome mean action never why because aspired to be gentleman that feeling kept above vanity be confounded donkey very apt to put head between leg chuck over pride be fine horse who will carry over ground enable to distance fellow traveller mr chuck have pride be always commendable even in boatswain how often have read of people rising from nothing becoming great men be from talent sure enough be talent with pride to force onward not talent with vanity to check be very right

between marine officer mr phillott occurred morning nothing at in marine officer be bit of gaby take offence where none be meant mr phillott have foul tongue have good heart what pity be be pity for be smart officer fact be peter that junior officer be too apt to copy superior make very important that young gentleman must sail with captain who be gentleman now phillott served best of time with captain ballover who be notorious in service for foul abusive language what be consequence that phillott many others who have served under have learnt bad habit must think o'brien that very circumstance of having have feeling so often wounded by such language when be junior officer must make doubly careful not to make use of to others when have advanced in service peter be just first feeling wear away after time at last own sense of indignation becomes blunted becoming indifferent to forget also that wound feeling of others carry habit with to great injury disgrace of service be time to dress for dinner so 'd better make scarce peter while tidivate off little according to rule regulation of majesty service when be asked to dine with skipper met at captain table where found a usual great display of plate very little else except ship allowance certainly have now be cruising time there be excuse for still few captain must have be so unprovided be afraid gentleman will not

never have taste for bad company midnight orgy have acquaintance with respectable portion of inhabitant of portsmouth at last ship company be removed into brig went out of harbour anchored at spithead captain hawkins came on board gave order book saying mr simple have great objection to written order a consider that article of war be quite sufficient to regulate ship still captain be in very responsible situation if accident occurs be held amenable therefore have framed few order of own for interior discipline of vessel may probably save harmless in case of being hauled over coal not with wish that must interfere with comfort of officer only to guard against mischance of onus may fall upon received order book captain went ashore when went down into gun room to look through at once perceived that if rigidly conformed to officer in ship must be rendered uncomfortable if not conformed to must be party be answerable showed to webster who agreed with gave a opinion that captain good nature amiability be blind that be intending to lay hold of a soon a be in power therefore called officer together told opinion webster supported be unanimously agreed that order must be obeyed although not without remonstrance major part of order however only referred to time that brig be in harbour a be about to proceed to sea be hardly worth while saying anything at present order for sailing of brig came down by same post received letter from sister ellen stating that have heard from captain fielding who have immediately written to bombay where regiment be stationed have received answer informing that there be married man in regiment of name of sullivan woman who have followed that regiment of name at once put end to research after wet nurse who have be confined in uncle house

next day sailed for station in north sea captain added night order book to other sent up evening to be returned in morning with signature of officer of night watch also required signature to general order book that might not say have not read have first watch when swinburne came up to well mr simple think have made much by exchange of captain have shrewd suspicion will have squall ere long must not judge too hastily swinburne replied say that must still must go little by look in world be sure look must help much be just like winter day short dirty walk deck a if plank be not good enough for foot mr williams say look a if be 'big with fate of cato of rome ' what that mean know joke suppose for youngster be always joking be ever up baltic mr simple now think of know never be have seen tight work up there with gun boat so must now with captain o'brien a for little man have idea 'twill be more talk than work appear to have taken great dislike to captain swinburne know whether a first lieutenant ought to listen to be because be first lieutenant tell mr simple never be mistaken in main of officer character when must look in face hear talk for hour came up on purpose to put on guard for feel convinced that towards mean mischief what doe mean by having greasy faced serjeant of marine in cabin for hour morning report a master of arm ought to come through a first lieutenant mean a spy upon upon in particular fellow have begun to give air already speaks to young gentleman a if be beneath thought might not know mr simple so thought right to tell be much obliged to swinburne for good wish can do duty why must fear anything man may do duty mr simple if captain be determined to ruin have power have be longer in service than have have be wide awake only be careful of one thing mr simple beg pardon for being so free in case lose temper fear of swinburne replied be very easy to say 'no fear of ' mr simple recollect have not yet have temper tried a officer have have always be treated like gentleman must find treated otherwise have too good blood in vein not to speak be sure of have seen officer insulted irritated till angel must put up with treatment then for unguarded word must have be swab not to have made use of sent out of service to devil forget swinburne that article of war be made for captain a well a for everybody else in ship know that still at court martial captain make great distinction between what superior say to inferior what inferior say to superior true replied quoting shakespeare 'that be in captain choleric word in soldier be rank blasphemy exactly meaning rather think said swinburne if captain call gentleman mus' say same to certainly not can demand court martial yes will be granted what do gain by be like beating against heavy gale lee tide thousand to one if fetch port if do vessel be strained to piece sail worn a thin a newspaper rigging chafed half through wanting fresh serving order for re fit laid up in ordinary for rest of life mr simple best plan be to grin bear keep sharp look out for depend upon mr simple in best ship company in world spy captain will always find spy follower do refer observation to mr swinburne said voice from under bulwark started round found captain who have crept upon deck unperceived by during conversation swinburne made reply touched hat walked over to leeward presume mr simple said captain turning to that consider justified in finding fault abusing captain to inferior officer on majesty quarter deck if heard previous conversation sir replied must be aware that be speaking generally about court martial imagine have be guilty of impropriety in conversing with officer upon point connected with service mean then to assert sir that gunner did not refer to when said word captain ' acknowledge sir that a be listening unperceived term might appear to refer to gunner have idea at time that be listening observation be that spy captain must always find spy follower take to be general observation be sorry that think otherwise very well mr simple said captain hawkins walked down companion ladder into cabin now a' odd mr simple must come up with intention of being of service to yet get into scrape however perhaps be for best open war be preferable to watching in dark stabbing in back never meant to have shown colour hit so hard that forgot suspect that to be case swinburne think that have better not talk more with to night wish have talked quite so much a thing have turned out replied swinburne good night sir reflected upon what have passed felt convinced that swinburne be right in saying that be better have occurred than otherwise now knew ground stood upon forewarned be being forearmed chapter lv encounter dutch brig of war captain hawkins very contemplative near capstan hard knock thanks for who be afraid men will talk brig go about on wrong tack at next morning be off texel must see low sand hill have scarcely made out when fog in offing cleared up made strange vessel hand be turned up sail made in chase made out to be brig of war a altered course considerably have idea that be enemy made private signal be unanswered cleared for action brig making sail on starboard tack following bearing about two mile on weather bow breeze be not steady at one time brig be staggering under top gallant sail while have royal set at must have hand by top gallant sheet topsail halyard while expanded stitch of canvas on whole however in hour have neared about mile men be at quarter happy to be so soon at old work jacket hat be thrown off bandana handkerchief tied round head else black silk handkerchief tied round waist gun be ready everything be in place soul be going to say be anxious for set to rather think must not include captain who from commencement showed sign of pleasure anything presence of mind when first chased vessel be reported that be merchantman be not until have broad daylight that discovered to be man of war there be one thing to be said in favour have never be in action in life breeze now fell light be with sail set when thick fog obscured from sight fog rolled on till met then must not see ten yard from brig be source of great mortification a have chance of losing fortunately wind be settling down fast into calm about twelve o'clock sail flapped against mast reported twelve o'clock asked captain whether must pipe to dinner not yet replied will put head about go about sir replied with surprise yes said be convinced that chase be on other tack at moment if will lose if go about sir said must get among sand will be sure of sir replied when ask advice will be pleased to give command vessel touched hat turned hand up about ship convinced that captain wished to avoid action a only chance of escape for brig be keeping wind in tack be on 'bout ship 'bout ship cried men what hell be going about for inquired of one a came up ladder silence there fore aft cried captain hawkins think can get round unless wear wind be very light then wear ship mr simple there be time when grumbling discontent among seaman be so participated by officer although show that expression made use of be passed unheeded such be case at present officer looked at other said nothing men be unguarded in expression brig wore gradually round when men be bracing up yard sharp on other tack instead of hurrah down with mark fell back with groan brace up yard in silence there said to men rope be coiled down piped to dinner captain who continued on deck must not fail to hear discontented expression occasionally be made use of on lower deck made observation occasionally looked over side to see whether brig went through water did slowly for about ten minute when fell perfect calm so that to use common sea phrase gained little by motion about half past one slight breeze from opposite quarter sprung up turned round to increased fog blew away in quarter of hour chase be again visible now upon lee beam men gave three cheer silence there fore aft cried captain angrily mr simple be way that ship company have be disciplined under late commander to halloo bawl whenever think proper be irritated at reflection upon o'brien replied yes sir have be always accustomed to express joy at prospect of engaging enemy very well mr simple replied how be to shift head inquired master touching hat for chase of course replied captain who then descended into cabin come lad said swinburne a soon a captain be below have be going round find pet be in good fighting order promise ye sha' wait for powder will find that rattlesnake can bite devilish hard yet expect aye without head too replied one of men who be joe miller of brig chase perceiving that must not escape for be coming up with hand over hand now shortened sail for action hoisting dutch colour captain hawkins again made appearance on quarter deck when be within mile of be to run alongside of how inquired mr simple command replied want interference whatever very well sir replied walked to gangway mr thompson cried captain who appeared to have screwed up courage to right pitch have now taken position for moment on one of carronades will lay brig right bang bang whiz whiz bang whiz came three shot from enemy cleaving air between mast captain jumped down from carronade hastened to capstern without finishing sentence will fire when be ready sir said for perceived that be not capable of giving correct order yes yes to be sure replied remaining where be thompson said to master think can manage in present commanding position to get foul of so a to knock away jib boom fore topmast then ca escape have good way on will manage simple name not thompson replied master jumping into quarter boat conning vessel in exposed situation a received enemy fire look out lad pour into now just a please said to men seaman be however too well disciplined to take immediate advantage of permission waited until passed just a master put up helm so a to catch jib boom between mast whole broadside be poured into bow chess tree jib boom fore topgallant went down have so much way through water that tore clear from rounding to wind shot head enemy although in confusion from effect of broadside put up helm to rake perceived manoeuvre did same then squaring sail ran with before wind engaging broadside to broadside continued about hour soon found that have fool to play with brig be well fought gun well directed have several men taken down below thought must be better to engage even closer there be about cable length between vessel a ran before wind at about six mile hour with slight rolling motion thompson said let see if can not beat from gun let port helm close till can shy biscuit on board just opinion simple will see if wo make sort of running fight of in few minute be so close on board of that men who loaded gun must touch other with rammer sponge men cheered be gallantly returned by enemy havoc be now commenced by musketry on side french captain who appeared a brave fellow a ever stepped stood for minute on hammock be also holding on by swifter of main rigging when took off hat politely saluted returned compliment fire became too hot wished to get under shelter of bulwark still must not go down first french captain appeared determined not to be first to quit post of honour at last one of marine hit in right arm clapped hand to part a if to point out to nodded be assisted down from hammock immediately quitted post for thought foolish to stand a mark for forty fifty soldier have already received bullet through small of leg effect of such close fire now became apparent gun be only half manned side terribly cut up sail rigging in tatter enemy be even worse off two broadside more brought mainmast by board men cheered threw in broadside enemy dropped astern rounded to rake also attempted to round to must not until have cleared away wreck taken in foresail lowered topsail then continued action with a much spirit a ever be fine fellow by god exclaimed thompson never saw man fight ship better have webster down poor fellow be sorry for replied be afraid that there be many poor fellow who have lost number of mess think useless throwing away advantage now have ca escape will fight way for ever have better run head repair damage then must surrender in crippled state when attack again agree with said thompson only point be that will soon be dark will not lose sight of can not get away if put before wind then will be at again gave loaded gun a forged head when be about mile from hove to to repair damage reader may now ask where be captain time answer be that be at capstern where stood in silence not once interfering during whole action be fought by thompson master how looked how behaved in other point during engagement can not pretend to say for have time to observe even now be busy knotting rigging rousing up new sail to bend getting everything in order must not have observed have not come up to for a soon a have ceased firing appeared to recover did not however first address commenced speaking to men come be smart lad send hand here to swab up blood here youngster run down to surgeon let know wish report of killed wounded by degree talked more at last came up to have be rather smartish mr simple very smart indeed sir replied then turned away to give direction maintop there send down hauling line on starboard side ay ay sir now then lad clap on run up at once maintop there hailed captain be little smarter by g d will call down for something did not come with good grace from one who have done nothing to who be working with energy mr simple said captain wish must carry on duty with le noise at event set that example during action muttered joe miller other men laughed heartily at implication in two hour during have carefully watched enemy who still lay where left be again ready for action will give men grog now sir said to captain must want replied captain mr simple like what call dutch courage think much doe fellow have shown plenty of said joe miller softly men about laughed heartily think sir observed that be injustice to fine ship company to hint at requiring dutch courage dutch courage be term for courage screwed up by drinking freely most respectfully beg leave to observe that men have not have afternoon allowance after fatigue have undergone really require command ship sir replied certainly sir be aware of rejoined be now ready for action again wait order enemy be two mile on lee quarter surgeon here came up with report good heaven said captain forty seven men killed wounded mr webster dangerously why brig be crippled can do more positively can do more can take brig anyhow cried one of seaman from dozen of men who be to leeward expecting order to renew attack what man be that cried captain one answered by g d ship be in state of mutiny mr simple will soon be think said voice from crowd knew very well captain having be short time with did not know do hear that mr simple cried captain regret to say that did hear sir little thought ever expression must have be made use of on board of rattlesnake then fearing must ask man name to pretend not to have recognised said who be that who made use of expression one answered be so dark that be impossible to distinguish men after such mutinous expression observed captain certainly will not risk majesty brig under command a must have wished to have done even in crippled state by again engaging enemy can only regret that officer appear a insolent a men perhaps captain hawkins will state in what when have proved insolent can not accuse hope expression be not applied to sir said thompson master touching hat silence gentleman if please mr simple wear round ship whether captain intended to attack enemy not must not tell be soon undeceived for when be round ordered to be kept away until dutch brig be on lee quarter then ordering master to shape course for yarmouth went down into cabin sent up word might pipe to supper serve out spirit rage indignation of men must not be withheld after went down to supper gave three heavy groan in concert indeed during whole of night officer who kept watch have great difficulty in keeping men from venting feeling in what might be almost termed justifiable mutiny a for myself must hardly control vexation brig be certain prize be proved for next day hauled down colour immediately to much smaller man of war fell in with still lying in same crippled state captain first lieutenant killed nearly two third of ship company either killed wounded have attacked must have hauled down colour immediately for be last broadside have killed captain a first lieutenant must have received promotion be now lost cried for vexation when thought of a lay in bed that conduct be severely commented upon by officer in gun room a well a by whole ship company hardly need say thompson be for bringing to court martial must most gladly have done if only be to get rid of have long conversation with old swinburne on subject proved to that have better not attempt for d 'ye see mr simple have proof did not run down below stood ground on deck although did nothing ca prove cowardice then although there can be great doubt of again with regard to not renewing attack why be not captain at liberty to decide what be best for majesty service if thought in crippled state of brig so close to enemy coast that be advisable why must only be brought in a error in judgment then there be thing must be remembered mr simple be that captain sitting on court martial will if be possible to extricate ever prove cowardice against brother captain because feel that be disgrace to whole cloth swinburne advice be good gave up thought of proceeding still appeared to that captain be very much afraid must be so extremely amiable polite during run home said that have watched how well have behaved in action must not fail to notice be something did not keep word for despatch be published before quitted roadstead not name of one officer mentioned only generally saying that conducted to satisfaction called enemy corvette not specifying whether be brig ship corvette whole be written in such bombastic style that one must have imagined that have fought vessel of superior force stated at end that a soon a repaired damage wore round that enemy declined further action so did certainly for best of possible reason that be too disabled to come down to might have be contested enormous list of killed wounded proved that have have hard fight capture of brig afterwards that have really overpowered so that on whole captain hawkins gained great deal of credit with although whisper be afloat came to ear of admiralty prevented from being posted more so a have modesty not to apply for chapter lvi consequence of action ship without fighting captain be like thing without head so do sailor think mutiny loss of famous ship company during stay at yarmouth be not allowed to put foot on shore upon plea that must repair damage proceed immediately to station real fact be that captain hawkins be very anxious that must not be able to talk about action finding charge preferred against re commenced system of annoyance apartment have window looked out upon where brig lay at anchor constantly watched motion with spy glass noting down if did not hoist up boat c exactly at hour prescribed in book of order so a to gather list of charge against if must did not find out until afterwards mentioned before when swinburne joined at plymouth have recommended figure head being put on brig have be done at o'brien expense not in cheap way recommended by swinburne in very handsome manner be large snake coiled up in fold with head darting out in menacing attitude tail with rattle appeared below whole be gilded have very good effect after dock yard men have completed repair brig be painted one night head of rattlesnake disappeared have be sawed off by malicious evil disposed person trace of be to be found be obliged to report to captain who be very indignant offered twenty pound for discovery of offender have offered twenty thousand never must have found out delinquent be however never forgotten for understood what be implied by manoeuvre new head be carved disappeared night after be fixed on rage of captain be without bound turned hand up declared that if offender be not given up must flog hand on board gave ship company ten minute then prepared to execute threat mr paul turn hand up for punishment said captain in rage descended to cabin for article of war when be down below officer talked over matter to flog man for crime of one be height of injustice be not for to oppose still ship company must have seen in countenance that shared feeling men be talking with other in group until appeared to have communicated idea on subject carpenter who have be slowly bringing aft grating left off job boatswain mate who have came aft rolled tail of cat round red handle man walked down below one be left on quarter deck marine under arm officer perceiving desired mr paul boatswain to send men up to rig grating quarter

state of thing wished for order presence on deck captain whose wrath appeared incapable of reflection immediately proceeded on deck ordered marine to load with cartridge be done a be afterwards told by thompson who be standing aft marine loaded with powder put ball into pocket wished to keep up character of corp for fidelity at same time not fire upon men whom loved a brother with whom coincided in opinion indeed afterwards discovered that be marine who have taken off head of snake second time captain then ordered boatswain to turn hand up boatswain made appearance with right arm in sling

what have done to be tied up said man strip scoundrel well sir if please be hard to be flogged for nothing man pulled off clothes walked up to grating quarter master seized up seized up sir reported scoundrel of sergeant of marine who acted a captain spy captain looked for article of war to read a be necessary previous to punishing man be little puzzled to find one where positive offence have be committed at last pitched upon one refers to combination conspiracy creating discontent took off hat a read then called mr paul boatswain ordered to give man dozen please sir said boatswain pointing to arm in sling ca flog ca lift up arm arm be well enough when came on board sir cried captain yes sir in hurrying men up slipped down ladder be afraid have put shoulder out captain bit lip fully

jones joe miller who be seized up beg honour pardon sir said turning head round if be to be flogged will be pleased to let have over will catch death cold naked here day be decided mockery on part of man roused captain sergeant of marine put miller man collins leg in iron for mutiny men perceive that there be conspiracy in ship will very soon put end to know men by god will repent paul pipe down mr simple man gig recollect be positive order that boat go on shore captain left brig looking dagger at a went over side have done duty cared little for indeed be now watching conduct a carefully a did mine captain wish to tell own story first said thompson coming up to now if be simple must take care that real fact must be known how be to be done replied have ordered communication with shore simply by sending officer on board of of frigate to state that brig be in state of mutiny request that will keep look out upon be more than duty a commanding officer only send message leave to state fact of own accord recollect that captain of frigate will be summoned if there be court of inquiry expect will take place considered little thought advice good despatched thompson first to one frigate then to other next day captain came on board a soon a stepped on quarter deck inquired how dare disobey order in sending boat away reply be that order be not to communicate with shore that a commanding officer considered duty to make known to other ship that men be in state of insubordination that might keep eye upon kept eye upon for time then turned away without reply a expected court of inquiry be called upon representation to admiral about twenty of men be examined so much came out a to reason why head of snake have be removed for sailor spoke boldly that admiral officer who be appointed strongly recommended captain hawkins not to proceed further than to state that there be disaffected character in ship move admiral to have exchanged into others be done captain of frigate who immediately gave advice divided best men between spoke very freely to asked who be best men told honestly for be glad to be able to get out of power of captain hawkins marked a disaffected exchanged for worst have on board few be left ran away thus from having one of finest best organised ship company in service be now one of very worst miller be sent on board of frigate under surveillance soon proved that character be a good a stated to be two year afterwards be promoted to rank of boatswain webster second lieutenant must not rejoin be appointed must here remark that there be hardly degree of severity captain may not exert towards seaman provided be confident of have proved to courage if there be doubt confirmation to contrary discipline be destroyed by contempt ship

anger proved that heart if not quite right be not very much out of place yet be tyrant although tyrant men forgave one kind act when be not led away by impetuosity of feeling obliterated hundred act of tyranny such be not case in service with men who in tyranny be seaman show quarter to will undergo risk severity of article of war render liable to rather than not express opinion of man whom

be never exposed unless by courage being called in question rarely occurs when doe occur be most difficult a well a most dangerous to attempt to prove may be asked why did not quit ship after having be aware of character of captain enmity bore to in reply can only say that did often think of talked over subject with messmate persuaded to remain a be first lieutenant knew that successful action must in probability insure promotion determined to use nautical expression to rough out not throw away only chance now have of obtaining rank a commander footnote marine chapter lvii news from home not very agreeable although reader may laugh arrive at portsmouth where fall in with old acquaintance mr trotter sail with convoy for baltic have written to sister ellen giving account of have passed mentioning character of captain apparent intimacy with uncle received answer from telling that have discovered from very communicative old maiden lady captain hawkins be illegitimate son of uncle by

time brig be again ready for sea expected to sail immediately did not forget to write to o'brien distance between be so great that knew must not obtain answer probably for year felt melancholy foreboding how much required advice order be to proceed to portsmouth join convoy collected there bound up baltic under charge of acasta frigate two other vessel did not sail with pleasure hope of gaining much in way of prize money captain be enough to make ship hell ship company be composed of mutinous incorrigible set of scoundrel with of course few exception how different did officer find brig after losing such captain a o'brien so fine ship company there be help for have to do be to make best of hope for better time cat be at work nearly day must acknowledge that generally speaking be deserved although sometimes report from sergeant of marine of good man favoured by be certain to be attended to system of receiving report direct from inferior officer instead of through a first lieutenant became so annoying that resolved at risk to expostulate soon have opportunity for one morning captain said to mr simple understand that have fire in galley last night after hour be very true sir did order stove to be lighted may inquire whether first lieutenant have not discretionary power in point further how be that be reported to by other people discipline of ship be carried on by under direction report ought to come through can not understand upon what ground permit through other channel command own ship sir will do a please in respect when have officer can confide in will in probability allow to report to if there be anything in conduct have proved to that be incapable not trustworthy must feel obliged to sir if must in first place point out in next bring to court martial if correct be court martial man sir replied be not to be dictated to by inferior officer so will oblige by holding tongue sergeant of marine a master at arm be bound to report to deviation from regulation have laid down for discipline of ship granted sir that report according to custom of service must come through first lieutenant prefer coming direct sir stand le chance of being garbled

against article of war state expressly that if officer soldier marine have complaint to make be to do so upon arrival at port fleet where may fall in with superior officer admit that article of war refers to complaint to be made by inferior against superior at same time venture to submit to honourable court that superior be equally bound to prefer charge to give notice that charge will be

replied steward oh screamed lady maid what will become of poor unprotected female hastened into cabin to impart dreadful intelligence lady in cabin be not in very enviable situation a for elder miss ossulton perhaps will be better in future to distinguish two lady by calling elder simply miss ossulton niece cecilia be sitting with salt to nose agonised with mixture of trepidation wounded pride mr lascelles be weeping weeping gently cecilia be sad heart be beating with anxiety suspense when maid rushed in o madam o miss o mr lascelles have found out be murderous bloody do everything pirate

believe what maid have reported still anxiety suspense be great especially about father after having restored aunt put on bonnet be lying on sofa where be going dear said mr lascelles on deck replied cecilia must will speak to men gracious heaven miss ossulton going on deck have heard what phoebe say yes aunt have can wait here no longer stop stop will be murdered will be be mad screamed miss

took off hat made bow know whom have honour of addressing young lady be flattered with mark of confidence feel assure feel correctly that be not exactly in lawless hand cecilia looked with more surprise than fear at pickersgill mr hautaine dress became be handsome fine looking man have nothing of ruffian in appearance unless like byron corsair be half savage half soft must not help thinking that have met many with le pretension a far a appearance went to claim of gentleman at almack other fashionable circle have ventured on deck sir said cecilia with little tremulousness in voice to request a favour that will inform what intention may be with regard to vessel with regard to lady feel much obliged to for so doing assure will a far a have made up own mind answer candidly tremble allow to conduct to seat in few word then to remove present alarm intend that vessel will be returned to owner with article in a religiously respected a if be church property with respect to other lady on board pledge honour that have nothing to fear that will be treated with respect privacy never invaded that in few day will be restored to friend young lady pledge hope of future salvation to truth of at same time must make few condition however will not be very severe sir replied cecilia much relieved for pickersgill have stood by in most respectful manner be presume captain of smuggler pray answer one question more what became of boat with lord b be father left in boat without hair of head touched young lady took away oar then will perish cried cecilia putting handkerchief to eye young lady be on shore probably by time although took away mean of assisting to capture left mean of gaining land be not one who must have done after conduct to begged not to go said cecilia told that be not fair that have quarrel with smuggler thank even for replied pickersgill now miss have not pleasure of recollecting lordship family name ossulton sir said cecilia looking at pickersgill with surprise then with permission miss ossulton will now make confidant excuse using so free term be because wish to relieve fear at same time can not permit to divulge intention to whole party on board feel may trust for have courage where there be courage there generally be truth must first tell whether will condescend to accept term cecilia demurred moment idea of being confidant of smuggler rather startled still knowledge of what intention be if might not reveal might be important a perhaps might dissuade must be in worse position than be now might be in much better conduct of pickersgill have be such up to present a to inspire confidence although defied law appeared to regard courtesy of life cecilia be courageous girl at length replied provided what desire to keep secret will not be injurious to one compromise in peculiar situation consent must not hurt fly miss ossulton in self defence have too much respect for from conduct during short meeting to compromise allow now to be very candid then perhaps will acknowledge that in situation others must do same perhaps not show half so much forbearance father without right interferes with calling attempt to make prisoner to have thrown in jail heavily fined perhaps sent out of country will not enter into defence of smuggling be sufficient to say that there be pain penalty attached to infraction of certain law choose to risk lord b be not empowered by government to attack be gratuitous act have thrown crew into sea must have be justified for be in short act of piracy on part now a father have thought to turn yacht into revenue cutter can not be surprised at retaliating in turning into smuggler a have mixed up looking after revenue with yachting can not be surprised if retaliate by mixing up little yachting with smuggling have dressed male companion a smuggler have sent in smuggling vessel to cherbourg where will be safely landed have dressed only person whom must join with in frolic a gentleman in place object be twofold one be to land cargo have now on board be very valuable other be to retaliate upon father companion for attempt upon by stepping into shoe enjoying for day two luxury be intention to make free with nothing lordship wine eatable that may be assured of will have pleasure if lady sit down to dinner table with a did before with father friend can hardly expect that sir said cecilia yes do will be not only price of early release of yacht will also be only mean by will obtain anything to eat observe miss ossulton sin of father be visited on child have now told what mean to do what wish leave to think of decide whether will not be best for party to consent have permission to tell other lady that may be conduct be a secure from ill treatment rudeness a if be in grosvenor square can not answer that will not be hungry if after such forbearance in point show so little gratitude a not to honour with company then be to understand that be to be starved into submission not starved miss ossulton recollect that will be on bread water detained until do consent detention will increase anxiety of father know how to persuade sir said cecilia a far a be concerned trust will ever be ready to sacrifice feeling of pride to spare father so much uneasiness with permission will now go down into cabin relieve companion from worst of fear a for obtaining what wish can only say that a young person be not likely to have much influence with older than must inevitably be overruled a have not permission to point out to reason might avail must so far allow to be relieved from promise a to communicate have said to to only married woman on board think then might obtain wish must candidly tell will attempt to effect only because be most anxious to rejoin friend be relieved of company replied pickersgill smiling ironically of course be must will have petty revenge although may probably will detest at event will not have very formidable charge to make against before go below miss ossulton give permission to add married lady to number of confidant must permit to introduce friend mr ossulton pickersgill waved hand in direction of corbett who took off hat made low obeisance be impossible for cecilia ossulton to help smiling continued pickersgill having taking command of yacht instead of lordship be absolutely necessary that also take lordship name while on board be lord b allow to introduce under name can not be addressed otherwise depend upon miss ossulton that will have most paternal solicitude to make happy comfortable have cecilia ossulton dared to have given vent to real feeling at time must have burst into fit of laughter be too ludicrous at same time very burlesque reassured still more went into cabin with heavy weight removed from heart in meantime miss ossulton mr lascelles remained below in greatest anxiety at cecilia prolonged stay knew not what to think dared not go on deck mr lascelles have once determined at risk to go up miss ossulton phoebe have screamed implored so fervently not to leave that unwillingly consented to remain cecilia countenance when entered cabin reassured mr lascelles not aunt who ran to cry sobbing clinging to saying what have done to poor poor cecilia nothing at aunt replied cecilia captain speaks very fairly say will respect in possible way provided that obey order if not if not what cecilia said miss ossulton grasping niece arm will starve not let go god have mercy on cried miss ossulton renewing sob cecilia then went to mr lascelles communicated to apart have passed mr lascelles agreed with cecilia that be in danger of insult a talked over matter at last began to laugh there be novelty in there be something so ridiculous in gentleman being turned into smuggler cecilia be glad that must not tell aunt a wished to be so frightened a never to have company on board of yacht again mr lascelles be too glad to annoy for many various insult received matter be therefore canvassed over very satisfactorily mr lascelles felt natural curiosity to see new lord b second mr ossulton have have breakfast be feeling very hungry now that alarm be over desired phoebe to ask steward for tea

friend be in general deportment behaviour otherwise than most respectful lady a be not afraid of be greater happiness than have reason to expect think may be amused to witness fear of who accuse sex of cowardice with permission will send for cook steward inquire about dinner must like to know what there be for dinner observed mr lascelles demurely must cecilia cecilia put handkerchief to mouth tell steward cook to come aft immediately cried pickersgill in few second made appearance steward cried pickersgill with loud voice yes lord replied maddox with hat in hand what wine have put out for

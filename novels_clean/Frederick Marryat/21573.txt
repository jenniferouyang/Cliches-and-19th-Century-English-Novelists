before amine have recovered from swoon chapter eight before follow philip vanderdecken in venturous career will be necessary to refresh memory of reader by succinct recapitulation of circumstance have directed enterprise of dutch towards country of east be now proving to source of wealth considered a inexhaustible let begin at beginning charles fifth after having possessed major part of europe retired from world for reason best known to divided kingdom between ferdinand philip to ferdinand gave austria dependency to philip spain to make division more equal palatable to latter threw low country with few million vegetating upon into bargain having thus disposed of fellow mortal much to own satisfaction went into convent reserving for small income twelve men pony whether afterwards repented hobby mounted pony be not recorded be certain that in two year died philip thought a many have thought before since that have right to do what pleased with own therefore took away from hollander most of liberty to make amends however gave inquisition dutch grumbled philip to stop grumbling burnt few of upon dutch who be aquatic in propensity protested against religion be much too warm for constitution in short heresy made great progress duke of alva be despatched with large army to prove to hollander that inquisition be very best of possible arrangement that be infinitely better that man must be burnt for hour in world than for eternity in next slight difference of opinion be occasion of war lasted about eighty year after having saved hundred of thousand trouble of dying in bed at length ended in seven united province being declared independent now must go back again for century after vasco de gama have discovered passage round cape of good hope portuguese be interfered with by other nation at last adventurous spirit of english nation be roused passage to india by cape have be claimed by portuguese a sole right defended by force for long time private company ventured to oppose trade be not of apparent value to induce government to embark in war upon question english adventurer therefore turned attention to discovery of north west passage to india

consequence be that while asserting fighting for independence have also fitted out expedition to india be successful in various speculator be by government formed into company upon same principle arrangement a have be chartered in england at time therefore to be reverting english dutch have be trading in indian sea for more than fifty year portuguese have lost nearly power from alliance friendship rival have formed with potentate of east who have suffered from portuguese avarice cruelty whatever may have be sum of obligation dutch owed to english for assistance received from during struggle for independence doe not appear that gratitude extended beyond cape for on other side of portuguese english dutch fought captured other vessel without ceremony there be law that of main force mother country be occasionally called upon to interfere interference up to above time have produced nothing more than paper war being very evident that party be in wrong in cromwell usurped throne of

possession of upon attempt philip started up seized by waist indeed cried philip with indignant look a released chain from pilot hand schriften appeared not in least confused at being detected in attempt looking with malicious one eye at philip mockingly observed doe that chain hold picture vanderdecken rose pushed away folded arm advise not to be quite so curious master pilot may repent perhaps continued pilot quite regardless of philip wrath may be child caul sovereign remedy against drowning go forward to duty sir cried philip a be catholic finger nail of saint yes have piece of holy cross philip started be be cried schriften who now went forward to where seaman be standing at gangway news for lad said have bit of holy cross aboard so may defy devil philip hardly knowing why have followed schriften a descended poop ladder be forward on quarterdeck when pilot made remark to seaman ay ay replied old seaman to pilot not only devil flying dutchman to boot flying dutchman thought philip can refer to philip walked step two forward so a to conceal behind mainmast hoping to obtain information must continue conversation in be not disappointed say that to meet with be worse than meeting with devil observed of crew who ever saw said have be seen be sartain just a sartain that ill luck follows vessel fall in with where be to be fallen in with o say be not so sartain cruise off cape must like to know whole long short of story said third can only tell what have heard be doomed vessel be pirate cut captain throat believe cried schriften captain be in now villain be say

with flying dutchman fear flying dutchman replied philip confused now think of be of same name at least say that name be vanderdecken eh there be many vanderdeckens in world besides replied philip who have recovered composure having made reply walked away to poop of vessel one must almost imagine malignant one eyed wretch be aware of cause of embarkation mused philip can not be why do feel chill whenever approach wonder if others do whether be mere fancy on part of amine dare ask question strange too that man must feel such malice towards never injured what have just overheard confirms there needed confirmation oh amine amine for thee must rejoice to solve riddle at expense of life god in mercy check current of brain muttered philip reason can not hold seat in three day ter schilling consort arrived at table bay where found remainder of fleet at anchor waiting for just at period dutch have formed settlement at cape of good hope where indian fleet used to water obtain cattle from hottentot tribe who lived on coast who for brass button large nail must willingly offer fat bullock few day be occupied in completing water of squadron then ship having received from admiral instruction a to rendezvous in case of parting company made preparation for bad weather anticipated again weighed anchor proceeded on voyage for three day beat against light baffling wind making little progress on third breeze sprang up strong from southward until increased to gale fleet be blown down to northward of bay on seventh day ter schilling found alone weather have moderated sail be again made upon vessel head put to eastward that might run in for land be unfortunate in thus parting with consort observed mynheer kloots to philip a be standing at gangway must be near meridian sun will enable to discover latitude be difficult to say how far may have be swept by gale current to northward boy bring up cross staff be mindful that strike against anything a come up cross staff at time be simple instrument used to discover latitude must give to nice observer to within five ten mile quadrant sextant be invention of much later period indeed considering that have so little knowledge of navigation variation of compass that easting westing must only be computed by dead reckoning be wonderful how ancestor traversed ocean in way did with comparatively so few accident be full three degree to northward of cape observed mynheer kloots after have computed latitude current must be running strong wind be going down fast will have change if mistake not towards evening fell calm with heavy swell setting towards shore shoal of seal appeared on surface following vessel a drove before swell fish darted leaped in direction ocean around appeared to be full of life a sun

chance of saving if wind freshens be now so near to breaker that felt swell in vessel lay becalmed turned over here there on long line breeze freshened vessel be stationary men be in boat with exception of mynheer kloots mate mynheer von stroom go through water now said philip yes think will save replied captain steady a go hillebrant continued to first mate who be at helm leave breaker now only let breeze hold ten minute breeze be steady ter schilling stood off from land again fell calm again be swept towards breaker at last breeze came off strong vessel cleaved through water men be called out of boat mynheer von stroom be picked up along with hat wig carried into cabin in le than hour ter schilling be out of danger now will hoist up boat said mynheer kloots let before lie down to sleep thank god for deliverance during night ter schilling made offing of twenty mile then stood to southward towards morning wind again fell be nearly calm mynheer kloots have be on deck about hour have be talking with hillebrant upon danger of evening selfishness pusillanimity of mynheer von stroom when loud noise be heard in poop cabin what can be said captain have good man lost sens from fright why be knocking cabin to piece at moment servant of supercargo ran out of cabin mynheer kloots hasten in help master will be killed bear bear bear what johannes cried mynheer kloots why animal be a tame a dog will go see before mynheer kloots must walk into cabin out flew in shirt affrighted supercargo god god be to be murdered eaten alive cried running forward attempting to climb fore rigging mynheer kloots followed motion of mynheer von stroom with surprise when found attempting to mount rigging turned aft walked into cabin when found to surprise that johannes be indeed doing mischief panelling of state cabin of supercargo have be beaten down wig box lay in fragment on floor two spare wig be lying by upon be strewed fragment of broken pot mass of honey johannes be licking up with peculiar gusto fact be that when ship anchored at table bay mynheer von stroom who be very partial to honey have obtained from hottentot honey careful servant have stowed away in jar have placed at bottom of two long box ready for master use during remainder of voyage morning servant fancying that wig of previous night have suffered when master tumbled over bear opened one of box to take out johannes happened to come near door scented honey now partial a mynheer von stroom be to honey bear be still more so will venture everything to obtain johannes have yielded to impulse of specie following scent have come into cabin be about to enter sleeping berth of mynheer stroom when servant slammed door in face whereupon johannes beat in panel found entrance then attacked wig box by showing most formidable set of teeth proved to servant who attempted to drive off that must not be trifled with in meanwhile mynheer von stroom be in utmost terror not aware of purport of bear visit imagined that animal object be to attack servant took to heel after vain effort to save last box mynheer von stroom then finding alone at length sprang out of bed place escaped a have mentioned to forecastle leaving johannes master of field luxuriating upon spolia opima mynheer kloots immediately perceived how case stood went up to bear spoke to then kicked bear must not leave honey growled furiously at interruption be bad job for johannes observed mynheer kloots now will leave ship for supercargo have just ground of complaint oh well must eat honey because will so saying mynheer kloots left cabin went to look after supercargo who remained on forecastle with bald head meagre body haranguing men in shirt fluttered in breeze be very sorry mynheer von stroom said kloots bear will be sent out of vessel yes yes mynheer kloots be affair for most puissant company life of servant be not to be sacrificed to folly of sea captain have nearly be torn to piece animal did not want wanted be honey replied kloots have got can not take from there be altering nature of animal will be pleased to walk down into cabin until beast can be secured will not go loose again mynheer von stroom who considered dignity at variance with appearance who perhaps be aware that majesty deprived of external be only jest thought advisable to accept offer after trouble with assistance of seaman bear be secured dragged away from cabin much against will for have still honey to lick off curl of full bottomed wig be put into durance vile having be caught in flagrant act of burglary on high sea new adventure be topic of day for be again dead calm ship lay motionless on glassy wave sun look red a sink observed hillebrant to captain who with philip be standing on poop will have wind before to morrow if mistake not be of opinion replied mynheer kloots be strange that fall in with of vessel of fleet must have be driven down here perhaps have kept wider offing have be a well if have done same said kloots be narrow escape last night there be such thing a having too little a well a having too much wind confused noise be heard among seaman who be collected together looking in direction of vessel quarter ship yes be be repeated more than once think see ship said schriften coming on poop where there in gloom said pilot pointing to darkest quarter in horizon for sun have set captain hillebrant philip directed eye to quarter pointed out thought must perceive something like vessel gradually gloom seemed to clear away lambent pale blaze to light up part of horizon not breath of wind be on water sea be like mirror more more distinct did vessel appear till hull mast yard be clearly visible looked rubbed eye to help vision for scarcely must believe that did see in centre of pale light extended about fifteen degree above horizon there be indeed large ship about three mile distant although be perfect calm be to appearance buffeting in violent gale plunging lifting over surface be smooth a glass now careening to bearing then recovering topsail mainsail be furled yard pointed to wind have sail set close reefed foresail storm staysail trysail abaft made little way through water apparently neared fast driven down by force of gale minute be plainer to view at last be seen to wear in so doing before be brought to wind on other tack be so close to that must distinguish men on board must see foaming water a be hurled from bow hear shrill whistle of boatswain pipe creaking of ship timber complaining of mast then gloom gradually rose in few second have totally disappeared god in heaven exclaimed mynheer kloots philip felt hand upon shoulder cold darted through whole frame turned round met one eye of schriften who screamed in ear philip vanderdecken be flying dutchman chapter ten sudden gloom have succeeded to pale light have effect of rendering object still more indistinct to astonished crew of ter schilling for moment more not word be uttered by soul on board remained with eye still strained towards point where apparition have be seen others turned away full of gloomy foreboding thought hillebrant be first who spoke turning round to eastern quarter observing light on horizon started seizing philip by arm cried out what be be only moon rising from bank of cloud replied philip mournfully well observed mynheer kloots wiping forehead be damped with perspiration have be told of before have mocked at narration philip made reply aware of reality of vision how deeply interested felt a if be guilty person moon have now risen above cloud be pouring mild pale light over slumbering ocean with simultaneous impulse one directed eye to spot where strange vision have last be seen be dead dead calm since apparition pilot schriften have remained on poop now gradually approached mynheer kloots looking round said mynheer kloots a pilot of vessel tell that must prepare for very bad weather bad weather said kloots rousing from deep reverie yes bad weather mynheer kloots there never be vessel fell in with what have just seen met with disaster soon afterwards very name of vanderdecken be unlucky philip must have replied to sarcasm must not tongue be tied have name of vanderdecken to do with observed kloots have not heard then captain of vessel have just seen be mynheer vanderdecken be flying dutchman how know that pilot inquired hillebrant know that much more if chose to tell replied schriften never mind have warned of bad weather a be duty with word schriften went down poop ladder god in heaven never be so puzzled so frightened in life observed kloots know what to think say what think philip be not supernatural yes replied philip mournfully have doubt of thought day of miracle have passed said captain that be now left to own exertion have other warning appearance of heaven gave warn now observed hillebrant see how bank of cloud have risen within five minute moon have escaped from will soon catch again see there be flash of lightning in north west well son can brave element a well a man do best have cared little for gale stress of weather like not warning a have have tonight heart a heavy a lead be truth philip send down for bottle of schnapps if be only to clear brain little philip be glad of opportunity to quit poop wished to have few minute to recover collect own thought appearance of phantom ship have be to dreadful shock not that have not fully believed in existence still to have beheld to have be so near vessel vessel in father be fulfilling awful doom vessel on board of felt sure that own destiny be to be worked out have given whirl to brain when have heard sound of boatswain whistle on board of eagerly have stretched earing to catch order given given be convinced in father voice have eye be le called to aid in attempt to discover feature dress of moving on deck a soon then a have sent boy up to mynheer kloots philip hastened to cabin buried face in coverlid of bed then prayed prayed until have recovered usual energy courage brought mind to state of composure must enable to look forward calmly to danger difficulty feel prepared to meet with heroism of martyr philip remained below not more than hour on return to deck what change have taken place have left vessel floating motionless on still water with lofty sail hanging down listlessly from yard moon then soared aloft in beauty reflecting mast sail of ship in extended line upon smooth sea now be dark water rippled short broke in foam smaller lofty sail have be taken in vessel be cleaving through water wind in fitful gust angry moanings proclaimed too surely that have be awakened up to wrath be gathering strength for destruction men be still busy reducing sail worked gloomily discontentedly what schriften pilot have said to philip knew not that avoided appeared to look upon with feeling of ill will be evident minute gale increased wind be not steady observed hillebrant there be saying from quarter storm may blow have already veered round five point philip much like appearance of thing may say with captain that heart be heavy indeed so be mine replied philip be in hand of merciful providence hard port flatten in forward brail up trysail men be smart cried kloots a from wind chopping round to northward westward ship be taken aback careened low before rain now came down in torrent be so dark that be with difficulty must perceive other on deck must clew up topsail while men can get upon yard see to forward mr hillebrant lightning now darted athwart firmament thunder pealed quick quick men let furl sailor shook water from streaming clothes worked others took advantage of night to hide away commune with own fear canvas be now taken off ship except fore staysail flew to southward with wind on quarter sea have now risen roared a curled in foam rain fell in torrent night be dark a erebus wet frightened sailor sheltered under bulwark although many have deserted from duty there be not one who ventured below night did not collect together a usual man preferred solitude own thought phantom ship dwelt on imagination oppressed brain be interminably long terrible night thought day must never come at last darkness gradually changed to settled sullen grey gloom be day looked at other found comfort in meeting other eye there be one countenance in beam of hope must be found lurking be doomed remained crouched where have sheltered during night said nothing sea have now risen mountain high more than once have struck ship abaft kloots be at binnacle hillebrant philip at helm when wave curled high over quarter poured in resistless force upon deck captain two mate be swept away dashed almost senseless against bulwark binnacle compass be broken into fragment one ran to helm vessel broached to sea broke clear over mainmast went by board be confusion captain kloots be stunned be with difficulty that philip must persuade two of men to assist down below hillebrant have be more unfortunate right arm be broken be otherwise severely bruised philip assisted to berth then went on deck again to try restore order philip vanderdecken be not yet much of seaman at event exercised that moral influence over men be ever possessed by resolution courage obey willingly did not did obey in hour vessel be clear of wreck eased by loss of heavy mast steered by two of best seaman again flew before gale where be mynheer von stroom during work of destruction in bed place covered up with clothes trembling in limb vowing that ever again put foot on shore not company in world must induce to trust to salt water again certainly be best plan for poor man although for time men obeyed order of philip be soon seen talking earnestly with one eyed pilot after consultation of quarter of hour left deck with exception of two at helm reason for so doing be soon apparent several returned with can full of liquor have obtained by forcing hatch of spirit room for about hour philip remained on deck persuading men not to intoxicate in vain can of grog offered to men at wheel be not refused in short time yawing of vessel proved that liquor have taken effect philip then hastened down below to ascertain if mynheer kloots be sufficiently recovered to come on deck found sunk into deep sleep with difficulty be that roused made acquainted with distressing intelligence mynheer kloots followed philip on deck still suffered from fail head be confused reeled a walked a if also have be making free with liquor when have be on deck few minute sank down on one of gun in state of perfect helplessness have in fact received severe concussion of brain hillebrant be too severely injured to be able to move from bed philip be now aware of helplessness of situation daylight gradually disappeared a darkness came upon so did scene become more appalling vessel still ran before gale men at helm have evidently changed course a wind be on starboard be now on larboard quarter compass there be none on deck even if there have be men in drunken state must have refused to listen to philip order expostulation said be sailor be not to teach how to steer ship gale be now at height rain have ceased wind have increased roared a urged on vessel steered so wide by drunken sailor shipped sea over gunnel men laughed joined chorus of song to howling of gale schriften pilot appeared to be leader of ship company with can of liquor in hand danced sang snapped finger like demon peered with one eye upon philip then must fall roll with scream of laughter in scupper more liquor be handed up a fast a be called for oath shriek laughter be mingled together men at helm lashed amid ship hastened to join companion ter schilling flew before gale fore staysail being only sail set checking a yawed to starboard to port philip remained on deck by poop ladder strange thought must stand here only one left now capable of acting must be fated to look by upon scene of horror disgust must here wait severing of vessel timber loss of life must accompany only one calm collected aware of what must soon take place god forgive appear useless impotent a be to stand here like master of storm separated a be from brother mortal by own peculiar destiny must be so wreck then must not be for feel that be not have charmed life rather protracted one to fulfil oath registered in heaven wind be not so loud surely water be not so rough foreboding may be wrong may yet be saved heaven grant for how melancholy how lamentable be to behold men created in god own image leaving world disgraced below brute creation philip be right in supposing that wind be not so strong sea so high vessel after running to southward till past table bay have by alteration made in course entered into false bay where to certain degree be sheltered from violence of wind wave although water be smoother wave be still more than sufficient to beat to piece vessel might be driven on shore at bottom of bay to point ter schilling be now running bay so far offered fair chance of escape a instead of rocky coast outside against have vessel run few second must have insured destruction there be shelving beach of loose sand of philip must of course have knowledge for land at entrance of bay have be passed unperceived in darkness of night about twenty minute more have elapsed when philip observed that whole sea around be one continued foam have hardly time for conjecture before ship struck heavily on sand remaining mast fell by board crush of falling mast heavy beating of ship on sand caused many of timber to part with whole sea swept clean over fated vessel checked song drunken revelry of crew minute vessel be swung round on broadside to sea lay on beam end philip who be to windward clung to bulwark while intoxicated seaman floundered in water to leeward attempted to gain other side of ship much to philip horror perceived body of mynheer kloots sink down in water now be several foot deep on lee side of deck without apparent effort on part of captain to save be then gone there be hope for philip thought of hillebrant hastened down below found still in bed place lying against side lifted out with difficulty climbed with on deck laid in long boat on boom a best chance of saving life to boat only one must be made available crew have also repaired repulsed philip who must have got into a sea made clean breaker over cast loose lashing confined with assistance of heavy sea lifted from chock be borne clear of boom dashed over gunnel into water to leeward be comparatively smooth not however without being filled nearly up to thwart be little cared for by intoxicated seaman who a soon a be afloat again raised shout song of revelry a be borne away by wind sea towards beach philip who held on by stump of mainmast watched with anxious eye now perceiving borne aloft on foaming surf now disappearing in trough more more distant be sound of mad voice till at last must hear more beheld boat balanced on enormous rolling sea then saw not again philip knew that now only chance be to remain with vessel attempt to save upon fragment of wreck that ship must long hold together felt be impossible already have parted upper deck shock of wave divided more more at last a clung to mast heard noise abaft then recollected that mynheer von stroom be still in cabin philip crawled aft found that poop ladder have be thrown against cabin door so a to prevent being opened removed entered cabin where found mynheer von stroom clinging to windward with grasp of death be not death paralysis of fear spoke to must obtain reply attempted to move be impossible to make let go part of bulk head that grasped loud noise rush of mass of water told philip that vessel have parted amid ship unwillingly abandoned poor supercargo to fate went out of cabin door at after hatchway observed something struggling be johannes bear who be swimming still fastened by cord prevented escape philip took out knife released poor animal hardly have done act of kindness when heavy sea turned over after part of vessel separated in many piece philip found struggling in wave seized upon part of deck supported be borne away by surf towards beach in few minute be near to land shortly afterwards piece of planking to be clinging struck on sand then being turned over by force of running wave philip lost hold be left to own exertion struggled long although so near to shore must not gain footing returning wave dragged back thus be hurled to fro until strength be gone be sinking under wave to rise more when felt something touch hand seized with grasp of death be shaggy hide of bear johannes who be making for shore who soon dragged clear of surf so that must gain footing philip crawled up beach above reach of wave exhausted with fatigue sank down in swoon when philip be recalled from state of lethargy first feeling be intense pain in still closed eye arising from having be many hour exposed to ray of ardent sun opened be obliged to close immediately for light entered into like point of knife turned over on side covering with hand remained time in position until by degree found that eyesight be restored then rose after few second must distinguish scene around sea be still rough tossed about in surf fragment of vessel whole sand be strewed with cargo content near be body of hillebrant other body who be scattered on beach told that who have taken to boat have perished be by height of sun about three o'clock in afternoon a near a must estimate philip suffered oppression of mind felt so wearied in such pain that took slight survey brain be whirling demanded be repose walked away from scene of destruction having found sand hill behind be defended from burning ray of sun again lay down sank into deep sleep from did not wake until ensuing morning philip be roused second time by sensation of something pricking on chest started up beheld figure standing over eye be still feeble vision indistinct rubbed for time for first thought be bear johannes again that be supercargo von stroom who have appeared before looked again found that be mistaken although have warrant for supposing to be either tall hottentot with assaguay in hand stood by side over shoulder have thrown fresh severed skin of poor bear on head with curl descending to waist be one of wig of supercargo von stroom such be gravity of black appearance in strange costume for in other respect be naked that at other time philip must have be induced to laugh heartily feeling be now too acute rose upon foot stood by side of hottentot who still continued immovable certainly without slightest appearance of hostile intention sensation of overpowering thirst now seized upon philip made sign that wished to drink hottentot motioned to to follow led over sand hill to beach where philip discovered upwards of fifty men who be busy selecting various article from scattered store of vessel be evident by respect paid to philip conductor that be chief of kraal few word uttered with greatest solemnity be sufficient to produce though not exactly what philip required small quantity of dirty water from calabash however be to delicious conductor then waved to to take seat on sand be novel appalling nevertheless ludicrous scene there be white sand rendered still more white by strong glare of sun strewed with fragment of vessel with cask bale of merchandise there be running surge with foam throwing about particle of wreck there be bone of whale have be driven on shore in former gale now half buried in sand showed portion of huge skeleton there be mangled body of philip late companion whose clothes appeared have be untouched by savage with exception of button have be eagerly sought after there be naked hottentot for be summer time wore not sheepskin krosses gravely stepping up down sand picking up everything be of value leaving civilised people most coveted to crown there be chief sitting in still bloody skin of johannes broad bottomed wig of mynheer stroom with gravity of vice chancellor in countenance without slightest idea that be in way ridiculous whole presented perhaps one of most strange chaotic tableau that ever be witnessed although at time dutch have not very long formed settlement at cape considerable traffic have be for many year carried on with native for skin other african production hottentot be therefore stranger to vessel a hitherto have be treated with kindness be well disposed towards european after time hottentot began to collect wood appeared to have iron in made up into several pile set on fire chief then made sign to philip to ask if be hungry philip replied in affirmative when new acquaintance put hand into bag made of goat skin pulled out handful of very large beetle presented to hum philip refused with mark of disgust upon chief very sedately cracked ate having finished whole handful rose made sign to philip to follow a philip rose perceived floating on surf own chest hastened to made sign that be took key out of pocket opened then made up bundle of article most useful not forgetting bag of guilder conductor made objection calling to one of men near pointed out lock hinge to then set off followed by philip across sand hill in about hour arrived at kraal consisting of low hut covered with skin be met by woman child who appeared to be in high admiration at chief new attire showed kindness to philip bringing milk drank eagerly philip surveyed daughter of eve a turned from offensive greasy attire strange form hideous feature sighed thought of charming amine sun be now setting philip still felt fatigued made sign that wished to repose led into hut though surrounded a be with filth nose assailed by variety of bad smell attacked moreover by insect laid head on bundle uttering short prayer of thanksgiving be soon in sound sleep next morning be awakened by chief of kraal accompanied by man who spoke little dutch stated wish to be taken to settlement where ship came anchored be fully understood man said that there be ship in bay at time philip nevertheless requested might be taken there a felt that best chance of getting on board of vessel must be by remaining at settlement at event must be in company of european until vessel arrived distance discovered be one day march le after little conversation with chief man who spoke dutch desired philip to follow that must take there philip drank plentifully from bowl of milk brought by one of woman again refusing handful of beetle offered by chief took up bundle followed new acquaintance towards evening arrived at hill from philip have view of table bay few house erected by dutch to delight perceived that there be vessel under sail in offing on arrival at beach to hastened found that have sent boat on shore for fresh provision accosted people told who be told also of fatal wreck of ter schilling of wish to embark officer in charge of boat willingly consented to take on board informed philip that be homeward bound philip heart leaped at intelligence have be outward bound must have joined now have prospect of again seeing dear amine before re embarked to follow out peculiar destiny felt that there be still happiness in store for that life be to be chequered with alternate privation repose that future prospect be not to be one continued chain of suffering until death be kindly received by captain of vessel who freely gave passage home in three month without event worth narrating philip vanderdecken found once more at anchor before town of amsterdam chapter eleven need hardly be observed that philip made possible haste to own little cottage contained that valued in world promised to month of happiness for have done duty felt that however desirous of fulfilling vow must not again leave home till autumn when next fleet sailed be now commencement of april much too a regretted loss of mynheer kloots hillebrant a well a death of unfortunate crew still there be solace in remembrance that be for ever rid of wretch schriften who have shared fate besides almost blessed wreck so fatal to others enabled so soon to return to arm of amine be late in evening when philip took boat from flushing went over to cottage at terneuse be rough evening for season of year wind blew fresh sky be covered with flaky cloud fringed here there with broad white edge for light of moon be high in heaven be at full at time light must be almost obscured by dark cloud passing over disk at others must burst out in brightness philip landed wrapping cloak round hastened up to cottage a with beating heart approached perceived that window of parlour be open that there be female figure leaning out knew that must be no other than amine after crossed little bridge proceeded to window instead of going to door amine for be who stood at window be so absorbed in contemplation of heaven above so deep in communion with own thought that saw heard approach of husband philip perceived abstraction paused when within four five yard of wished to gain door without being observed a be afraid of alarming by too sudden appearance for remembered promise that if dead must if permitted visit a father have visited mother while thus stood in suspense amine eye be turned upon beheld thick cloud now obscured moon disk dim light gave to form indistinctly seen unearthly shadowy appearance recognised husband having reason to expect return recognised a inhabitant of world of spirit started parted hair away from forehead with hand again earnestly gazed on be amine be afraid cried philip hastily be not afraid replied amine pressing hand to heart be over now spirit of dear husband for such think thou art thank thee welcome even in death philip welcome amine waved hand mournfully inviting philip to enter a retired from window god think dead thought philip hardly knowing how to act entered in at window found sitting on sofa philip must have spoken amine whose eye be fixed upon a entered who be fully convinced that be supernatural appearance exclaimed so soon so soon o god thy will be done be hard to bear philip beloved philip feel that soon will follow philip be now more alarmed be fearful of sudden reaction when amine must discover that be still alive amine dear hear have appeared unexpectedly at unusual hour throw into arm will find that philip be not dead not dead cried amine starting up still warm in flesh blood amine still fond doting husband replied philip catching in arm pressing to heart amine sank from embrace down upon sofa fortunately be relieved by burst of tear while philip kneeling by supported o god o god thank thee relied amine at last thought be spirit philip o be glad to see even continued weeping on shoulder can listen to dearest said philip after silence of few moment o speak speak love can listen for ever in few word philip then recounted what have taken place occasion of unexpected return felt more than repaid for that have suffered by fond endearment of still agitated amine father amine be well will talk of to morrow yes thought philip a awoke next morning dwelt upon lovely feature of still slumbering wife yes god be merciful feel that there be still happiness in store for nay more that happiness also depends upon due performance of task must be punished if be to forget solemn vow

wick in tumbler of oil gave faint glimmering light curtain of bed be drawn by side of be kneeling figure be well known to philip that of father seysen philip recoiled blood retreated to heart must not speak panting for breath supported against wall at last vented agony of feeling by deep groan aroused priest who turned head perceiving who be rose from knee extended hand in silence be dead then at last exclaimed philip son not dead there be yet hope crisis be at hand in one more hour fate will be decided then either will be restored to arm follow many hundred whom fatal epidemic have consigned to tomb father seysen then led philip to side of bed withdrew curtain amine lay insensible breathing heavily eye be closed philip seized burning hand knelt down pressed to lip burst into paroxysm of tear a soon a have become somewhat composed father seysen persuaded to rise sit with by side of bed be melancholy sight to witness at return philip said to who be so ardent so impetuous must be doubly so god will be done remember there be yet hope not strong hope grant still there be hope for so told medical man who have attended who will return expect in few minute disease be typhus fever have swept off whole family within last two month still rage violently fortunate indeed be house have to mourn one victim must that have not arrived just now for be disease easily communicated many have

holding to nose sponge saturated with vinegar entered room bowed head to philip priest then went to bedside for minute held finger to pulse of sufferer then laying down arm put hand to forehead covered up with bedclothes handed to philip sponge vinegar making sign that must use beckoned father seysen out of room in minute priest returned have received direction son think that may be saved clothes must be kept on replaced if must throw off everything will depend upon quiet calm after recovers sens surely can promise replied philip be not knowledge of return even sight of alarm joy seldom kill even when shock be great there be other cause for uneasiness what be holy father philip be now thirteen day amine have raved during period have seldom quitted to perform duty of office to others who required have be afraid to leave philip for in raving have told tale even unconnected a have be a have thrilled soul with horror evidently have long lain heavily on mind must retard recovery philip vanderdecken may remember must once have have secret from secret forced mother to tomb now may send young wife to follow for be evident that know be not true doe know replied philip mournfully have in delirium told nay trust have told more than of will not speak now watch philip will return in hour for by time doctor tell symptom will decide whether will return to reason be lost to for ever philip whispered to priest that have be accompanied by father mathias who be to remain a guest requested to explain circumstance of present position to see that be attended to father seysen then quitted room when philip sat down by bedside drew back curtain perhaps there be situation in life so agonising to feeling a in philip be now placed joyful emotion when expecting to embrace in health beauty object of warmest affection of continual thought during long absence suddenly checked by disappointment anxiety grief at finding lying emaciated changed corrupted with disease mind overthrown eye unconscious of presence existence hanging by single hair frame prostrate before king of terror who hovers over with uplifted dart longs for fiat must permit to pierce unconscious victim ala thought philip be thus meet amine truly did father mathias advise a hurried so impetuously along not a fondly thought to happiness to misery god of heaven be merciful forgive if have loved angelic creature of thy formation even more than have thee spare good heaven spare be lost for ever philip covered up face remained for time in prayer then bent over amine impressed kiss upon burning lip be burning hot still there be moisture upon philip perceived that there be also moisture on forehead felt hand palm of be moist carefully covering with bedclothes watched with anxiety hope in quarter of hour have delight of perceiving amine be in profuse perspiration gradually breathing became le heavy instead of passive state in have remained moved became restless philip watched replaced clothes a threw off until at last appeared to have fallen into profound sweet sleep shortly after father seysen physician made appearance philip stated in few word what have occurred doctor went to bedside in minute returned wife be spared to mynheer be not advisable that must see so unexpectedly shock may be too great in weak state must be allowed to sleep a long a possible on waking will have returned to reason must leave then to father seysen may not remain in room until awakes will then hasten away unobserved will be useless disease be contagious have be here too long already remain below must change clothes see that prepare bed for in room to must be transported a soon a think can bear then let window be thrown open that room may be properly ventilated will not do to have wife just rescued from jaw of death run risk of falling sacrifice to attention necessary to sick husband philip perceived prudence of advice quitting room with medical man went changed clothes then joined father mathias whom found in parlour below be right father said philip throwing on sofa be old suspicious be young buoyant philip trust may yet be well trust so too replied philip then remained silent absorbed in thought for now that imminent danger be over be reflecting upon what father seysen have communicated to relative to amine having revealed secret whilst in state of mental aberration priest perceiving that mind be occupied did not interrupt hour have thus passed when father seysen entered room return thanks to heaven son amine have awakened be perfectly sensible collected there be now little doubt of recovery have taken restorative ordered by doctor though be so anxious to repose once more that must hardly be persuaded to swallow be now again fast asleep watched by one of maiden in probability will not move for many hour moment of such sleep be precious must not be disturbed will now see to refreshment must be needful to philip have not introduced to companion who perceive be of own calling forgive sir replied philip will have great pleasure in making acquaintance with father mathias who have promised to reside with trust for time will leave together see to breakfast being prepared for delay of trust father mathias will accept apology philip then left room went into kitchen having ordered what be requisite to be taken into parlour put on hat walked out of house must not eat mind be in state of confusion event of morning have be too harassing exciting felt a if fresh air be necessary to existence a proceeded careless in direction met many with whom have be acquainted from whom have received condolence at supposed bereavement congratulation when learnt from that danger be over from also learnt how fatal have be pestilence not one third of inhabitant of terneuse surrounding country remained alive who have recovered be in state of exhaustion prevented from returning to accustomed occupation have combated disease remained prey of misery want philip mentally vowed that must appropriate saving to relief of around be not until more than two hour have passed away that philip returned to cottage on arrival found that amine still slumbered two priest be in conversation below son said father seysen let now have little explanation have have long conference with good father who hath much interested with account of extension of holy religion among pagan hath communicated to much to rejoice at much to grieve for among other question put to have in consequence of what have learnt during mental alienation of wife interrogated upon point of supernatural appearance of vessel in eastern sea observe philip that secret be known to must not have put question to surprise hath stated visitation of kind to be eye witness can not reasonably be accounted for except by supernatural interposition strange certainly most awful visitation philip must not be better instead of leaving in maze of doubt that now confided to fact connected with strange history so that may ponder on give benefit of advice of who be older than who by calling may be able to decide more correctly whether supernatural power have be exercised by good evil intelligence holy father speaks well philip vanderdecken observed mathias if be work of almighty to whom must confide by whom must be guided by who do service on earth if of evil one to whom to whose duty wish be to counteract baneful influence reflect philip that secret may sit heavily on mind of cherished wife may bow to grave a did trust sainted mother with supported by presence may bear well recollect how many be lonely day night that must pas during absence how much must require consolation help of others secret like must be a gnawing worm strong a may be in courage must shorten existence for support balm may receive from minister of faith be cruel selfish of philip to leave lone woman to bear up against absence at same time oppressed with so fatal knowledge have convinced holy father replied philip feel must before have made acquainted with strange history will now state whole of circumstance have occurred with little hope advice can help in case so difficult in duty so peremptory yet so perplexing philip then entered into minute detail of have passed from few day previous to mother death until present time when have concluded observed see father have bound by solemn vow that vow have be recorded accepted appears to have nothing now to do to follow peculiar destiny son have told strange startling thing thing not of world if be not deceived leave now father mathias will consult upon serious matter when be agreed will know decision philip went upstairs to see amine be still in deep sleep dismissed servant watched by bedside for nearly two hour did remain there when be summoned down to meet two priest have have long conversation son said father seysen upon strange perhaps supernatural occurrence say perhaps for must have rejected frenzied communication of mother a imaginings of heated brain for same reason must have be equally inclined to suppose that high state of excitement that be in at time of death may have disordered intellect a father mathias positively asserts that strange if not supernatural appearance of vessel did take place on passage home appearance tally with corroborates legend if so may call to have given evidence say that be not impossible that be supernatural recollect that same appearance of phantom ship have be permitted to to many others replied philip yes replied father seysen who be there alive of who saw be of little importance will admit that whole affair be not work of man of superior intelligence superior indeed replied philip be work of heaven be point not so easily admitted there be power a well a be divine that of devil arch enemy of mankind a power inferior to power of god can not act without permission may indirectly admit that be will of heaven that such sigh portent must be allowed to be given on certain occasion then opinion be same good father nay not exactly son elymas sorcerer be permitted to practise art gained from devil that might be proved by overthrow blindness how inferior be master to divine ruler doe not therefore follow sorcery generally be permitted in instance may be true that evil one have be permitted to exercise power over captain crew of ship a warning against such heavy offence supernatural appearance of vessel may be permitted so far be justifiable in believing great question be first whether be father who be thus doomed secondly how far be necessitated to follow up mad pursuit appears to although may end in destruction can not possibly be mean of rescuing father from state of unhallowed abeyance do understand philip certainly understand what must say father answer not yet be opinion of holy father a well a of myself that allowing fact to be a suppose revelation made to be not from on high suggestion of devil to lead into danger ultimately to death for if be task a suppose why did not vessel appear on last voyage how can allowing that met fifty time have communication with with be phantom shadow thing not of world now what propose be that must spend proportion of money left by father in mass for repose of soul mother in other circumstance must certainly have done that having so done must remain quietly on shore until new sign must be given to may warrant supposing that be really chosen for strange pursuit oath father recorded vow from son holy church hath power to absolve absolution will receive have put into hand by decision must be guided if there be wrong be not who be responsible at present let say more will now go up so soon a wife awakens prepare for meeting when father seysen have quitted room father mathias debated matter with philip long discussion ensued in similar argument be made use of by priest philip although not convinced be at least doubtful perplexed left cottage new sign corroborative sign thought philip surely there have be sign wonder enough still may be true mass for father soul may relieve from state of torture at event if decide for be not to blame well then let wait for new sign of divine will if so must be philip walked on occasionally thinking on argument of father seysen oftener thinking of amine be now evening sun be fast descending philip wandered on until at last arrived at very spot where have knelt down pronounced solemn vow recognised looked at distant hill sun be just at same height whole scene place time be before again philip knelt down took relic from bosom kissed watched sun bowed to earth waited for sign sun sank down veil of night spread over landscape there be sign philip rose walked home towards cottage more inclined than before to follow suggestion of father seysen on return philip went softly up stair entered room of amine whom found awake in conversation with priest curtain be closed be not perceived with beating heart remained near wall at head of bed reason to believe that husband have arrived said amine in faint voice oh tell why so ship be arrived know one who have seen said that be well why be not here then who must bring news of return father seysen have not arrived be here know must be if be safe well know philip too well say be not here fear not if say yes if say kill be here amine replied father seysen here well o god thank where be if be here must be in room else deceive oh suspense be death be here cried philip opening curtain amine rose with shriek held out arm then fell senseless back in few second however be restored proved truth of good father assertion that joy doe not kill must now pas over few day during philip watched couch of amine who rapidly regained strength a soon a be well enough to enter upon subject philip narrated have passed since departure confession have made to father seysen result amine too glad that philip must remain with added persuasion to of priest for little time philip talked more of going to sea chapter fourteen six week have flown away amine restored to health wandered over country hanging on arm of adored philip nestled by side in comfortable home father mathias still remained guest mass for repose of soul of vanderdecken have be paid for more money have be confided to care of father seysen to relieve suffering of afflicted poor may be easily supposed that one of chief topic of conversation between philip amine be decision of two priest relative to conduct of philip have be absolved from oath at same time that submitted to clerical adviser be by mean satisfied love for amine wish for remaining at home certainly added weight to fiat of father seysen although in consequence obeyed more willingly doubt of propriety of conduct remained same argument of amine who now that be supported by opinion of priest have become opposed to philip departure even caress with argument be mingled be effective for moment sooner be philip left to sooner be question for time dismissed than felt inward accusation that be neglecting sacred duty amine perceived how often cloud be upon brow knew too well cause constantly did recommence argument caress until philip forgot that there be aught amine in world one morning a be seated upon green bank picking flower blossomed round tossing away in pure listlessness amine took opportunity that have often waited for to enter upon subject hitherto unmentioned philip said do believe in dream think that may have supernatural communication by such mean of course may replied philip have proof abundant of in holy writing why then do not satisfy scruple by dream dearest amine dream come unbidden can not command prevent can command philip say that must dream upon subject nearest to heart will will yes have power philip although have not spoken of have from mother with much more that of late have never thought of know philip never say that be not tell that if choose will dream upon to what good amine if have power to make dream power must be from somewhere be of course there be agency little think of in country be still called into use have charm philip never fails charm amine do then deal in sorcery for such power can not be from heaven can not tell only know power be given must be from devil amine why so philip may not use argument of own priest who say that power of devil be only permitted to be used by divine intelligence that can not used without permission ' allow then to be sorcery what please unless by heaven permitted must fail can not see why must suppose that be from evil source ask for warning in dream to guide conduct in doubtful circumstance surely evil one must rather lead wrong than right amine may be warned in dream a patriarch be of old to use mystic unholy charm to procure vision be making compact with devil compact evil must not fulfil if not permitted by higher power philip reasoning be false be told that by certain mean duly observed may procure dream wish observance of mean be certainly least can attend to to prove sincerity forgive philip be not observance a necessary in religion have embraced be not told that omission of mere ceremony of water to infant will turn future chance of happiness to misery eternal philip answered not for time be afraid amine said at last in low tone fear nothing philip when intention be good replied amine follow certain mean to obtain end what be end be to find out if possible what may be will of heaven in perplexing case if must be through agency of devil what then becomes servant not master be permitted by heaven to act against amine eye darted fire a thus boldly expressed did mother often exercise art inquired philip after pause not to knowledge be said that be most expert died young a know must have known much more think philip that world be solely peopled by such dross a be thing of clay perishable corruptible lord over beast ourselves little better have not from own sacred writing repeated acknowledgment proof of higher intelligence mixing up with mankind acting here below why must what be then not be now what more harm be there to apply for aid now than few thousand year ago why must suppose that be permitted on earth then not permitted now what have become of have perished have be ordered back to where to heaven if to heaven world mankind have be left to mercy of devil agent do suppose that poor mortal have be thus abandoned tell plainly think not no longer have communication with intelligence that once have because a become more enlightened become more proud seek not that still exist host of good against host of evil invisibly opposing other be conviction tell philip do in conscience believe that have be revealed to be mere dream of imagination believe so amine know well wish must then be reasoning proved for if such communication can be made to why can not others can not tell by what agency priest say be that of evil one think be from on high by same rule who be to decide from whence dream will come 't be true amine be certain of power certain of if plea superior intelligence to communicate with that communication may be relied upon will not dream pas away hour in deep sleep what dream will be connected with question at issue then amine have made mind up will dream for at present mind be racked by contending perplexing doubt must know whether be right wrong night art will be employed not night yet to morrow night philip think one moment that in proposing serve against own wish feel a if dream will decide against that will be commanded to return to duty for tell honestly think not with priest be wife philip be duty that must not be deceived having mean a suppose to decide conduct offer promise that if do will grant favour will ask a reward be promised amine without being known replied philip rising from turf now let go home observed that philip previous to sailing in batavia have invested large proportion of fund in dutch east india stock interest of money be more than sufficient for want of amine on return found that fund left in charge have accumulated after paying to father sum for mass for relief of poor there be considerable residue philip have employed in purchase of more share in india stock subject of conversation be not renewed philip be rather averse to amine practising mystical art if known to priest must have obtained for in probability anathema of church must not admire boldness power of amine reasoning still be averse to reduce into practice third day have passed away more have be said upon subject philip retired to bed be soon fast asleep amine slept not so soon a be convinced that philip must not be awakened slipped from bed dressed left room in quarter of hour returned bringing in hand small brazier of lighted charcoal two small piece of parchment rolled up fixed by knot to centre of narrow fillet exactly resembled philacteries be once worn by jewish nation be similarly applied one of gently bound upon forehead of husband other upon left arm threw perfume into brazier a form of husband be becoming indistinct from smoke filled room muttered few sentence waved over small sprig of shrub held in white hand then closing curtain removing brazier sat down by side of bed if there be harm thought amine at least deed be not 't be mine can not say that have practised art be unlawful forbidden by priest on head be there be contemptuous curl on amine beautiful arched lip did not say much for devotion to new creed morning dawned philip still slumbered 't be enough said amine who have be watching rising of sun a beheld upper limb pear above horizon again waved arm over philip holding sprig in hand cried philip awake philip started up opened eye shut again to avoid glare of broad daylight rested upon elbow appeared to be collecting thought where be exclaimed in own bed yes passed hand across forehead felt scroll what be continued pulling off examining amine where be good heaven what dream cried perceiving scroll tied to arm see now amine be doing philip threw down buried face in pillow amine in mean time have slipped into bed have taken place by philip side sleep philip dear sleep said putting arm round will talk when wake again be there amine replied philip confused thought be alone have dreamed philip again be fast asleep before must complete sentence amine too tired with watching slumbered be happy father mathias have to wait long while for breakfast that morning be not till two hour later than usual that philip amine made appearance welcome child said be late be father replied amine for philip slept watched till break of day hath not be ill trust replied priest not ill must not sleep replied amine then didst thou do well to pas night a doubt not thou hast done child in holy watching philip shuddered knew that watching have cause be known must have be in priest opinion anything holy amine quickly replied have indeed communed with higher power a far a poor intellect hath be able blessing of holy church upon thee child said old man putting hand upon head on thee too philip philip confused sat down to table amine be collected a ever spoke little be true appeared to commune with own thought a soon a repast be finished old priest took up breviary amine beckoning to philip went out together walked in silence until arrived at green spot where amine have first proposed to that must use mystic power sat sown philip fully aware of purpose took seat by in silence philip said amine taking hand looking earnestly in face last night dreamed did indeed amine replied philip gravely tell dream for will be for to expound fear need little exposition amine must know be from what intelligence dream have be received tell dream replied amine calmly thought replied philip mournfully be sailing a captain of vessel round cape sea be calm breeze light be abaft sun went down star be more than usually brilliant weather be warm lay down on cloak with face to heaven watching gem twinkling in sky occasionally falling meteor thought that fell asleep awoke with sensation a if sinking down looked around mast rigging hull of vessel have disappeared be floating by upon large beautifully shaped shell on wide waste of water be alarmed afraid to move lest must overturn frail bark perish at last perceived fore part of shell pressed down a if weight be hanging to soon afterwards small white hand grasped remained motionless must have called out that little bark must sink must not gradually figure raised from water leaned with arm over fore part of shell where first have seen hand be female in form beautiful to excess skin be white a driven snow long loose hair covered end floated in water arm be rounded like ivory said in soft sweet voice philip vanderdecken what do fear have not charmed life ' know not replied whether life be charmed not know that be in danger ' in danger replied might have be in danger when be trusting to frail work of men wave love to rend to fragment good ship a call float about upon sufferance where can be danger when in mermaid shell mountain wave respect upon cresting surge dare not throw spray philip vanderdecken have come to seek father ' have replied be not will of heaven be destiny destiny rule above below will seek together shell be mine know not how to navigate will assist ' will bear ' will see replied laughing a sank down from fore part of shell immediately afterwards appeared at side be not more than three inch above water to alarm raised up sat upon edge weight appeared to have effect a soon a be seated in way for foot still remained in water shell moved rapidly along moment increased speed with other propelling power than of volition do fear now philip vanderdecken ' replied passed hand across forehead threw aside tress have partly concealed face said then look at ' looked amine beheld observed amine with smile upon lip yes amine be called by name threw arm round felt must remain with sail about world for ever proceed philip said amine calmly thought ran thousand thousand of mile passed by beautiful island set like gem on ocean bed at one time bounding against rippling current at others close to shore skimming on murmuring wave rippled on sand whilst cocoa tree on beach waved to cooling breeze be not in sea that father must be sought said must try elsewhere ' by degree wave rose until at last be raging in fury shell be tossed by tumultuous water still not drop entered sailed in security over billow must have swallowed up proudest vessel do fear now philip ' said to ' replied with amine fear nothing ' be now off cape again said here may find father let look well round for if meet ship must be none phantom ship must swim in gale like away flew over mountainous wave skimming from crest to crest between little bark sometimes wholly out of water now east now west north south in quarter of compass changing course minute passed over hundred of mile at last saw vessel tossed by furious gale there ' cried pointing with finger there be father vessel philip ' rapidly did approach saw from on board brought vessel to wind be alongside gangway be clearing away for though boat must have boarded shell be safe looked up saw father amine yes saw heard a gave order pulled relic from bosom held out to smiled a stood on gunnel holding on by main shroud be just rising to mount on board for have handed to man rope when there be loud yell man jumped from gangway into shell shrieked slipped from side disappeared under wave in moment shell guided by man who have taken place flew away from vessel with rapidity of thought felt deadly chill pervade frame turned round to look at new companion be pilot schriften one eyed wretch who be drowned when be wrecked in table bay not yet ' cried in agony of despair rage hurled off seat on shell floated on wild water philip vanderdecken ' said a swam will meet again turned away head in disgust when wave filled bark down sank be struggling under water sinking still deeper deeper without pain when awoke now amine said philip after pause what think of dream doe not point out that be friend philip that pilot schriften be enemy grant be dead be that so certain hardly must have escaped without knowledge be true dream must imply otherwise philip be opinion that only way in dream be to be expounded be that remain on shore for present advice be that of priest in case require further intimation in dream be safe guide be guided now by again be so amine if strange art be in opposition to holy faith expound dream in conformity with advice of minister do now philip let dismiss subject from thought must time come amine will not persuade from duty recollect have promised to grant one favour when ask have say then amine what may be wish o nothing at present have wish on earth what be gratified have not dear philip replied amine fondly throwing on husband shoulder chapter fifteen be about three month after conversation amine philip be again seated upon mossy bank have mentioned have become favourite resort father mathias have contracted great intimacy with father seysen two priest be almost a inseparable a be philip amine having determined to wait summons previous to philip again entering upon strange fearful task happy in possession of other subject be seldom revived philip who have on return expressed wish to director of company for immediate employment if possible to have command of vessel have since period taken further step have have communication with amsterdam be fond of bank philip said amine appear to have formed intimacy with be here if recollect that debated subject of lawfulness of inducing dream be here dear philip that told dream that expounded did so amine if ask opinion of father seysen will find that must give rather strong decision against must call heretical damnable let if plea have objection to tell pray not amine let secret remain with only think father mathias must blame certainly do well there be kindness liberality about old man admire must like to argue question with a amine spoke philip felt something touch shoulder sudden chill ran through frame in moment idea reverted to probable cause turned round head to amazement beheld supposed to be drowned mate of ter schilling one eyed schriften who stood behind with letter in hand sudden appearance of malignant wretch induced philip to exclaim merciful heaven be possible amine who have turned head round at exclamation of philip covered up face burst into tear be not fear that caused unusual emotion on part conviction that husband be never to be at rest in grave philip vanderdecken said schriften have letter for be from company philip took letter previous to opening fixed eye upon schriften thought said that be drowned when ship be wrecked in false bay how did escape how did escape replied schriften allow to ask how did escape be thrown up by wave replied philip interrupted schriften wave ought not to have thrown up why not pray did not say that presume wish have be so on contrary escaped in same way that did be thrown up by wave ca wait here have done bidding stop replied philip answer one question do sail in same vessel with time 'd rather be excused replied schriften be not looking for phantom ship mynheer vanderdecken with reply little man turned round went away at rapid pace be not summons amine said philip after pause still holding letter in hand with seal unbroken will not deny dearest philip be most surely so hateful messenger appears to have risen from grave that might deliver forgive philip be taken by surprise will not again annoy with woman weakness poor amine replied philip mournfully ala why did not perform pilgrimage alone be selfish of to link with so much wretchedness join with in bearing fardel of never ending anxiety suspense who must bear with dearest philip if be not wife of bosom little know heart if think shrink from duty philip be pleasure even in most acute pang for consider be by partaking with relieving of portion of sorrow be proud that be wife of one who have be selected to be so peculiarly tried dearest more of must read letter philip did not answer broke seal found that letter intimated to that be appointed a first mate to vrow katerina vessel sailed with next fleet requesting must join a quickly a possible a must soon be ready to receive cargo letter be from secretary further informed that after voyage might be certain of having command of vessel a captain upon condition must be explained when called upon board thought philip that have requested command of vessel for voyage observed amine mournfully did replied philip not having followed up application appears not to have be attended to have be own fault now be too late yes dearest most assuredly so matter not must a willingly perhaps rather sail voyage a first mate philip may a well speak now that be disappointed must confess fully expected that must have have command of vessel may remember that exacted promise from on very bank upon now sit at time that told dream that promise will still exact now tell have intended to ask be dear philip permission to sail with with care for nothing can be happy under privation danger to be left alone for so long brooding over painful thought devoured by suspense impatient restless incapable of applying to one thing dear philip be height of misery be what feel when be absent recollect have promise philip a captain have mean of receiving wife on board be bitterly disappointed in being left time do therefore to certain degree console by promising that will sail with next voyage if heaven permit return promise amine since be so earnest can refuse nothing have foreboding yours happiness will be wrecked for ever be not visionary doe appear to that strangely mixed up a be at once with world next little portion of futurity be opened to have given promise amine from must fain be released if ill do come philip be destiny who can avert fate amine be free agent to certain extent be permitted to direct own destiny ay so must father seysen fain have made believe what said in support of assertion be to incomprehensible yet said that be part of catholic faith may be so be unable to understand many other point wish faith be made more simple a yet good man for good really be have only led into doubt passing through doubt will arrive at conviction amine perhaps so replied amine appears to be a yet on outset of journey come philip let return must to amsterdam will go with after labour of day at least until sail amine smile must still enliven be not so yes dearest must have proposed wonder much how schriften must come here did not see body be certain escape be to miraculous why did not appear when saved where must have be what think amine what have long thought philip be ghoul with evil eye permitted for cause to walk earth in human form be certainly in way connected with strange destiny if requires anything to convince of truth of have passed be appearance wretched afrit oh have mother power forget displeases philip that ever talk of such thing be silent philip replied not absorbed in own meditation walked back in silence to cottage although philip have made up own mind immediately sent portuguese priest to summon father seysen that might communicate with take opinion a to summons have received having entered into fresh detail of supposed death of schriften reappearance a messenger then left two priest to consult together went upstairs to amine be more than two hour before philip be called down father seysen appeared to be in state of great perplexity son said be much perplexed have hoped that idea upon strange communication be correct that allowing that have obtained from mother have seen to have be deception still that be work of evil one if so prayer mass must have destroyed power advised to wait summons have received letter be of course nothing reappearance of bearer of letter be question to be considered tell philip what be opinion on point be possible might have be saved why not a well a acknowledge possibility father replied philip may have be cast on shore have wandered in direction be possible although anything probable since ask opinion must say candidly consider be earthly messenger nay be sure of that be mysteriously connected with destiny be certain who be what be of course can not tell then son have come to determination in instance not to advise must act now upon own responsibility own judgment in what way soever may decide will not blame prayer will be that heaven may still have in holy keeping decision holy father be to obey summons be so son something may occur may assist to work out mystery mystery acknowledge to be beyond comprehension of too painful nature for to dwell upon philip said more for perceived that priest be not at inclined to converse father mathias took opportunity of thanking philip for hospitality kindness stated intention of returning to lisbon by first opportunity might offer in few day amine philip took leave of priest quitted for amsterdam father seysen taking charge of cottage until amine return on arrival philip called upon director of company who promised ship on return from voyage be about to enter upon making condition that must become part owner of vessel to philip consented then went down to visit vrow katerina ship to have be appointed a first mate be still unrigged fleet be not expected to sail for two month only part of crew be on board captain who lived in dort have not yet arrived so far a philip must judge vrow katerina be very inferior vessel be larger than many of others old badly constructed nevertheless a have be several voyage to indie have returned in safety be to be presumed that must not have be taken up by company if have not be satisfied a to seaworthiness having given few direction to men who be on board philip returned to hostelrie where have secured apartment for amine next day a philip be superintending fitting of rigging captain of vrow katerina arrived stepping on board of by plank communicated with quay first thing that did be to run to mainmast embrace

fact sooner be ecstasy of captain over than philip introduced to informed of appointment oh be first mate of vrow katerina sir be very fortunate man next to being captain of first mate be most enviable situation in world certainly not on account of beauty observed philip may have many other good quality not on account of beauty why sir say a father have said before be vrow before be mine that be handsomest vessel in world at present can not judge besides being handsomest vessel have good quality under sun be glad to hear sir replied philip prof that one must never judge by appearance be not very old old not more than twenty eight year just in prime stop dear sir till see dancing on water then will hing day discourse with upon excellence have doubt that will have very happy time together provided subject be not exhausted replied philip that never will be on part allow to observe mr vanderdecken officer who find fault with vrow katerina quarrel with be knight have already fought three men in defence trust will not have to fight fourth philip smiled thought that be not worth fighting for acted upon suggestion from time forward never ventured to express opinion against beautiful vrow katerina crew be soon complete vessel rigged sail bent be anchored in stream surrounded by other ship composing fleet about to be despatched cargo be then received on board a soon a hold be full there came to philip great vexation order to receive on board soldier other passenger many of whom be accompanied by wife family philip worked hard for captain did nothing praise vessel at last have embarked everything fleet be ready to sail be now time to part with amine who have remained at hostelrie to whom philip have dedicated spare moment that must obtain fleet be expected to sail in two day be decided that on morrow must part amine be cool collected felt convinced that must see husband again with feeling embraced a separated on beach stepped into boat in be to be pulled

that boat be alongside philip be climbing up vessel farewell farewell dearest husband must be man 't be better a be amine watched till must no longer perceive philip then walked slowly to hostelrie next day when arose found that fleet have sailed at daylight channel have be so crowded with vessel be now untenanted be gone muttered amine now for many month of patient calm enduring can not say of living for exist in presence chapter sixteen must leave amine to solitude follow fortune of philip fleet have sailed with flowing sheet bore gallantly down zuyder zee have not be under way hour before vrow katerina be left mile two astern mynheer barentz found fault with setting trimming of sail with man at helm who be repeatedly changed in short with everything dear vrow katerina must not do still dropped astern proved to be worst sailing vessel in fleet mynheer vanderdecken said at last vrow a father used to say be not so very fast before wind vessel be good on wind seldom be will say that in other point of sailing there be other vessel in fleet equal to vrow katerina besides observed philip who perceived how anxious how captain be on subject be heavily laden have so many troop on deck fleet cleared sand be then close hauled when vrow katerina proved to sail even more slowly than before when be so very close hauled observed mynheer barentz vrow doe not do so well point free then will see how will show stern to whole fleet be fine vessel mynheer vanderdecken be not very fine roomy vessel replied philip be that in conscience must say fleet sailed on sometimes on wind sometimes free let point of sailing be what might vrow katerina be invariably astern fleet have to heave to at sunset to enable to keep company still captain continued to declare that point of sailing on happened to be be only point in vrow katerina be deficient unfortunately vessel have other point quite a bad a sailing be crank leaky did not answer helm well mynheer barentz be not to be convinced adored ship like men desperately in love must see fault in mistress others be not so blind admiral finding voyage so much delayed by bad sailing of one vessel determined to leave to find way by so soon a have passed cape be however spared cruelty of deserting for heavy gale came on dispersed whole fleet on second day good ship vrow katerina found alone labouring heavily in trough of sea leaking so much a to require hand constantly at pump drifting before gale a fast to leeward almost a usually sailed for week gale continued day did situation become more alarming crowded with troop encumbered with heavy store groaned laboured while whole sea washed over men must hardly stand at pump philip be active exerted to utmost encouraging worn out men securing where aught have given way little interfered with by captain who be sailor well observed captain to philip a held on by belaying pin will acknowledge that be fine weatherly vessel in gale be not softly beauty softly continued speaking to vessel a plunged heavily into wave timber groaned softly dear softly how poor devil in other ship must be knocking about now heh mynheer vanderdecken have start of time must be terrible long way down to leeward think so really can not pretend to say replied philip smiling why there be not one of in sight yes by heaven there be look on lee beam see one now well must be capital sailer at event look there point abaft beam mercy on how stiff must be to carry press of canvas philip have already seen be large ship on wind on same tack a be in gale in vessel must carry topsail vrow katerina being under close reefed foresail staysail ship seen to leeward be standing under press of sail topgallant sail royal flying jib stitch of canvas must be set in light breeze wave be running mountain high bearing minute vrow katerina down to gunwale ship seen appeared not to be affected by tumultuous water sailed steadily smoothly on even keel at once philip knew must be phantom ship in father doom be being fulfilled very odd be not observed mynheer barentz philip felt oppression on chest that must not reply a held on with one hand covered up eye with other seaman have now seen vessel legend be too well known many of troop have climbed on deck when report be circulated eye be now fixed upon supernatural vessel when heavy squall burst over vrow katerina accompanied with peal of thunder heavy rain rendering so thick that nothing must be seen in quarter of hour cleared away when looked to leeward stranger be longer in sight merciful heaven must have be upset have gone down in squall said mynheer barentz thought a much carrying such press of sail there never be ship must carry more than vrow katerina be madness on part of captain of vessel suppose wished to keep up with heh mynheer vanderdecken philip did not reply to remark fully proved madness of captain felt that ship be doomed when thought of number on board who might be sacrificed shuddered after pause said mynheer barentz gale be likely to continue best ship that ever be built can not in opinion stand such weather must advise that bear up run back to table bay to refit depend upon will find whole fleet there before never fear for good ship vrow katerina replied captain see what weather make of cursed bad observed one of seaman for seaman have gathered near to philip to hear what advice might be if have known that be such old crazy beast never must have trusted on board mynheer vanderdecken be right must back to table bay ere worse befall ship to leeward have given warning be not seen for nothing ask mr vanderdecken captain know well for be sailor appeal to philip made start be however made without knowledge of philip interest in phantom ship must say replied philip that have fallen in with vessel mischief have ever followed vessel why what be there in vessel to frighten carried too much sail have gone down never go down replied one of seaman exclaimed many voice will if run back pooh nonsense mynheer vanderdecken what say have already stated opinion replied philip who be anxious if possible to see ship once more in port that best thing can do be to bear up for table bay captain continued old seaman who have just spoken be determined that will be so whether like not so up with helm hearty mynheer vanderdecken will trim sail why what be cried captain barentz mutiny on board of vrow katerina impossible vrow katerina best ship fastest in whole fleet dullest old rotten tub cried one of seaman cried captain what do hear mynheer vanderdecken confine that lying rascal for mutiny pooh nonsense be mad replied old seaman never mind come mynheer vanderdecken will obey helm must be up immediately captain stormed philip by acknowledging superiority of vessel at same time that blamed seaman for panic pointed out to necessity of compliance mynheer barentz at last consented helm be put up sail trimmed vrow katerina rolled heavily before gale towards evening weather moderated sky cleared up sea wind subsided fast leaking decreased philip be in hope that in day two must arrive safely in bay a steered course so did wind gradually decrease until at last fell calm nothing remained of tempest long heavy swell set to westward before vrow katerina be gradually drifting be respite to worn out seaman also to troop passenger who have be cooped below drenched on main deck upper deck be crowded mother basked in warm sun with child in arm rigging be filled with wet clothes be hung up to dry on part of shroud seaman be busily employed in repairing injury of gale by reckoning be not more than fifty mile from table bay moment expected to see land to southward of be again mirth one on board except philip considered that danger be more to be apprehended second mate whose name be krantz be active good seaman great favourite with philip who knew that must trust to be on afternoon of day that philip be walking together on deck what think vanderdecken of strange vessel saw have seen before krantz what vessel have be in when have seen vessel have never returned into port others tell same tale be then ghost of vessel be told so there be various story afloat concerning of assure that be fully persuaded that accident will happen before reach port although everything at moment appears so calm port be so near at hand be superstitious replied krantz yet must say that to appearance be not like reality vessel must carry such sail in gale yet there be madman afloat who will sometimes attempt most absurd thing if be vessel must have gone down for when cleared up be not to be seen be not very credulous nothing occurrence of consequence anticipate will make believe that there be anything supernatural in affair well will not be sorry if event prof wrong replied philip have foreboding be not in port yet be trifling distance from there be prospect of continuance of fine weather there be saying from what quarter danger may come replied philip have other thing to fear than violence of gale true replied krantz nevertheless let croak notwithstanding say prophesy in two day at farthest be safely anchored in table bay conversation here dropped philip be glad to be left alone melancholy have seized depression of spirit even greater than have ever felt before leant over gangway watched heaving of sea merciful heaven ejaculated be pleased to spare vessel let not wail of woman shriek of poor child now embarked be heard numerous body of men trusting to plank let not be sacrificed for father crime philip mused way of heaven be indeed mysterious thought why must others suffer because father have sinned yet be not so everywhere how many thousand fall on field of battle in war occasioned by ambition of king influence of woman how many million have be destroyed for holding different creed of faith work in own way leaving to wonder to doubt sun have set before philip have quitted gangway gone down below commending embarked with to care of providence at last fell asleep before bell be struck eight time to announce midnight be awakened by rude shove of shoulder perceived krantz who have first watch standing by by heaven above vanderdecken have prophesied right up quick ship on fire on fire exclaimed vanderdecken jumping out of berth where main hold will up immediately krantz in mean time keep hatch on rig pump in le than minute philip be on deck where found captain barentz who have also be informed of case by second mate in few word be explained by krantz there be strong smell of fire proceeding from main hold on removing one of hatch have done without calling for assistance from knowledge of panic must create found that hold be full of smoke have put on again immediately have only made known to philip captain thanks for presence of mind replied philip have now time to reflect quietly on what be to be done if troop poor woman child knew danger alarm must have much impeded how must have taken fire in main hold never heard of vrow katerina talking fire before observed captain think be impossible must be mistake be now recollect that have in cargo several case of vitriol in bottle interrupted philip in gale must have be disturbed broken kept above in case of accident rolling gunwale under for so long time must have occasioned one of to fetch way be depend upon observed krantz did object to receive stating that ought to go out in vessel be not so encumbered with troop so that might remain on main deck replied that invoice be made out must not be altered now to act idea be to keep hatch on so a to smother if possible yes replied krantz at same time cut hole in deck just large enough to admit hose pump a much water a can down into hold be right krantz send for carpenter set to work will turn hand up speak to men smell fire now very strong there be time to lose if can only keep troop woman quiet may do something hand be turned up soon made appearance on deck wondering why be summoned men have not perceived state of vessel for hatch having be kept on little smoke that issued ascended hatchway did not fill lower deck lad said philip be sorry to say that have reason to suspect that there be danger of fire in main hold smell cried one of seaman so do cried several others with show of alarm moving away a if to go below silence remain where be men listen to what say if frighten troop passenger will hing must trust to ourselves there be time to be lost mr krantz carpenter be doing can be done at present now men do favour to sit down on deck one of while tell what must do order of philip be obeyed effect be excellent gave men time to compose after first shock for perhaps of shock to human frame there be none creates greater panic than first intimation of fire on board of vessel situation indeed pitiable when be considered that have to choose between two element seeking destruction philip did not speak for minute two then pointed out to men danger of situation what be measure krantz have decided upon taking how necessary be that must be cool collected also reminded that have little powder in magazine be far from site of fire must easily be removed thrown overboard that if fire must not be extinguished have quantity of spar on deck to form raft with boat must receive on board that be short distance from land philip address have most beneficial effect men rose up when ordered one portion went down to magazine handed up powder be passed along thrown overboard went to pump krantz coming up reported hole to have be cut in planking of deck above main hold hose be fixed quantity of water soon poured down be impossible that danger must be kept secret troop be sleeping on deck very employment of seaman pointed out what have occurred even if smoke now increased very much filled lower deck have not betrayed in few minute alarm of fire be heard throughout vessel men woman child be seen hurrying on clothes running frightened about deck shrieking praying confusion terror be hardly to be described judicious conduct of philip be then made evident have sailor be awakened by appalling cry must have be equally incapable of acting a be troop passenger subordination must have ceased must have seized boat left majority to perish others must have hastened to spirit room by drunkenness added to confusion horror of scene nothing must have be effected almost must in probability have perished miserably have be prevented by presence of mind shown by philip second mate for captain be cipher not wanting in courage certainly without conduct knowledge of profession seaman continued steady to duty pushing soldier out of way a performed allotted task philip perceiving went down below leaving krantz in charge by reasoning with most collected by degree brought majority of troop to state of comparative coolness powder have be thrown overboard hole having be cut in deck on other side other pump be rigged double quantity of water poured into hold be evident to philip that combustion increased smoke steam now burst through interstice of hatchway hole cut in deck with violence proved extent of fire raged below philip thought advisable to remove woman child to poop quarter deck of ship desiring husband of woman to stay with be melancholy sight tear stood in philip eye a looked upon group of female weeping straining child to bosom more quiet more collected than men elder child mute cry because mother cried younger one unconscious of danger playing with first object attracted attention smiling at parent officer commanding troop be two ensign newly entered very young men ignorant of duty without authority for men in case of extreme danger will not obey who be more ignorant than at philip request remained with superintended woman child so soon a philip have given order that woman child must be properly clothed many of be not went again forward to superintend labour of seaman who already began to show symptom of fatigue from excess of exertion many of soldier now offered to work at pump service be willingly accepted effort be in vain in about hour more hatch be blown up with loud noise column of intense searching flame darted up perpendicularly from hold high a lower mast head then be heard loud shriek of woman who pressed child in agony to breast a seaman soldier who have be working pump in precipitate retreat from scorching flame rushed aft fell among huddled crowd be steady lad steady good fellow exclaimed philip there be danger yet recollect have boat raft although can not subdue fire save vessel still may if be cool collected not only save ourselves one even poor infant who now appeal to a men to exert yourselves in behalf come come lad let do duty have mean of escape in power if lose time carpenter get ax cut away boom lashing now men let get boat out make raft fur poor woman child be not ten mile from land krantz see to boat with starboard watch larboard watch with to launch over boom gunner take of cordage can ready for lashing come lad there be want of light can work without lantern men obeyed a philip to encourage have almost jocularly remarked for joke be often well timed when apparently on threshold of eternity there be want of light column of fire now ascended above main top licking with forky tongue top mast rigging embracing main mast in fold loud roar with ascended proved violence rapidity of combustion below how little time there be to be lost lower main deck be now so filled with smoke that one must remain there few poor fellow sick in cot have long be smothered for have be forgotten swell have much subsided there be not breath of wind smoke rose from hatchway ascended straight up in air a vessel have lost steerage way be fortunate boat be soon in water trusty men placed in spar be launched over arranged by men in boat lashed together grating be then collected firmly fixed upon spar for people to sit upon philip heart be glad at prospect now have of saving number be embarked chapter seventeen difficulty be not surmounted fire now have communicated to main deck burst out of port hole amid ship raft have be forming alongside be obliged to be drifted astern where be more exposed to swell retarded labour in mean time fire be making rapid progress main mast have long be burning fell over side with lurching of vessel flame out of main deck port soon showed point above bulwark while volume of smoke be poured in upon upper deck almost suffocating number be crowded there for communication with fore part of ship have be for time cut off by flame one have retreated aft woman child be now carried on to poop not only to remove farther from suffocating smoke that might be lowered down to raft from stern be about four o'clock in morning when be ready by exertion of philip seaman notwithstanding swell woman child be safely placed on raft where be considered that must be le in way a men must relieve other in pulling when be tired after woman child have be lowered down troop be next ordered to descend by ladder few be lost in attempt falling under boat bottom not re appearing two third of be safely put on berth be ordered to take by krantz who have gone down to superintend important arrangement such have be vigilance of philip who have requested captain barentz to stand over spirit room hatch with pistol until smoke on main deck rendered precaution unnecessary that not single person be intoxicated to might be ascribed order regularity have prevailed during trying scene before one third of soldier have descended by stern ladder fire burst out of stern window with violence that nothing must withstand spout of vivid flame extended several foot from vessel roaring with force of blowpipe at same time flame burst through after port of main deck remaining on board found encircled with fire suffocated with smoke heat stern ladder be consumed in minute dropped into sea boat have be receiving men be obliged also to back astern from intense heat of flame even on raft shrieked a found scorched by ignited fragment fell on a be enveloped in opaque cloud of smoke hid from who still remained on deck of vessel philip attempted to speak to on board be not heard scene of confusion took place ended in great loss of life only object appeared to be who must first escape though except by jumping overboard there be escape have waited a philip must have pointed out to have one by one thrown into sea men in boat be fully prepared to pick up have climbed out to end of latteen mizen yard be lowered down might have descended safely by rope scorching of flame surrounded suffocation from smoke be overpowering most of soldier sprang over taffrail at once a nearly so a possible consequence be that there be thirty forty in water at same time scene be a heart rending a be appalling sailor in boat dragging in a fast a must woman on raft throwing to loose garment to haul in at one time wife shrieking a saw husband struggling sinking into eternity at curse execration from swimmer who be grappled with by drowning man dragged with under surface of eighty men who be left of troop on board at time of bursting out of flame from stern window twenty five be saved there be few seaman left on board with philip major part having be employed in making raft manning three boat who be on board remained by side regulating motion by after allowing full time for soldier to be picked up philip ordered men to climb out to end of latteen yard hung on taffrail to lower down on raft if be under to give notice to boat to receive raft have be dropped farther astern by seaman on board of might not suffer from smoke heat sailor one after lowered down be received by boat philip desired captain barentz to go before captain refused be too much choked with smoke to say why doubt that must have be something in praise of vrow katerina philip then climbed out be followed by captain be received into one of boat rope have hitherto held raft to ship be now cast off be taken in by boat in short time vrow katerina be borne to leeward of philip krantz now made arrangement for better disposal of people sailor be almost put into boat that might relieve one in pulling remainder be placed on raft along with soldier woman child notwithstanding that boat be all a much loaded a must well bear number on raft be so great that sunk nearly foot under water when swell of sea poured upon stanchion rope to support on board have be fixed men remained at side while woman child be crowded together in middle a soon a arrangement be made boat took raft in tow just a dawn of day appeared pulled in direction of land vrow katerina be by time one volume of flame have drifted about mile to leeward captain barentz who be watching a sat in boat with philip exclaimed well there go lovely ship ship must do everything speak be sure that not ship in fleet must have made bonfire a have doe not burn beautifully nobly poor vrow katerina perfect to last never will see such ship a again well be glad father did not live to see sight for must have broken heart poor man philip made reply felt respect even for captain barentz misplaced regard for vessel made little way for swell be rather against raft be deep in water day dawned appearance of weather be not favourable promised return of gale already breeze ruffled surface of water swell appeared to increase rather than go down sky be overcast horizon thick philip looked out for land must not perceive for there be haze on horizon so that must not see more than five mile felt that to gain shore before coming night be necessary for preservation of so many individual of whom more than sixty be woman child who without nourishment be sitting on frail raft immersed in water land in sight gale coming on in probability heavy sea dark night chance be indeed desperate philip be miserable most miserable when reflected that so many innocent being might before next morning be consigned to watery tomb why yes there be feeling although philip must reason against never must conquer for own life cared nothing even idea of beloved amine be nothing in balance at moment only point sustained be knowledge that have duty to perform in full exercise of duty recovered land ahead be now cried out by krantz who be in headmost boat news be received with shout of joy from raft boat anticipation hope news gave be like manna in wilderness poor woman on raft drenched sometimes above waist by swell of sea clasped child in arm still closer cried darling will be saved philip stood upon stern sheet to survey land have satisfaction of finding that be not five mile distant ray of hope warmed heart breeze now have gradually increased rippled water quarter from wind came be favourable adverse being on beam have have sail for boat must have be otherwise have be stowed away must not be procured sight of land naturally rejoiced seaman in boat cheered double banked oar to increase way towing of large raft sunk under water be easy task must not with exertion advance more than mile hour until noon continued exertion not without success be not three mile from land a sun passed meridian change took place breeze blew strong swell of sea rose rapidly raft be often so deeply immersed in wave a to alarm for safety of upon way be proportionably retarded by three o'clock have not gained mile from where have be at noon men not having have refreshment of kind during labour excitement of so many hour began to flag in exertion wish for water be expressed by from child who appealed to mother to seaman who strained at oar philip did must to encourage men finding so near to land so overcome with fatigue that raft in tow must not allow to approach haven murmured talked of necessity of casting loose raft looking out for feeling of self prevailed be mutinous philip expostulated with out of respect for continued exertion for hour when circumstance occurred decided question upon have recommenced debate increased swell fresh breeze have so beat about tossed raft that be with difficulty for time that occupant must hold on loud shout mingled with scream attracted attention of in boat philip looking back perceived that lashing of raft have yielded to force of wave that have separated amidship scene be agonising husband be separated from wife child floating away from other for part of raft be still towed by boat have already left other far astern woman rose up screamed held up child more frantic dashed into water between attempted to gain floating wreck upon husband stood sank before must be assisted horror increased one lashing having given way rest soon followed before boat must turn give assistance sea be strewed with spar composed raft with men woman child clinging to loud be yell of despair shriek of woman a embraced offspring in attempting to save be lost spar of raft still close together be hurled one upon other by swell many found death by being jammed between although boat hastened to assistance there be so much difficulty danger in forcing between spar few be saved even few be more than boat must well take in seaman few soldier be picked up female child have sunk beneath wave effect of catastrophe may be imagined hardly described seaman who have debated a to casting adrift to perish wept a pulled towards shore philip be overcome covered face remained for time without giving direction heedless of what passed be now five o'clock in evening boat have cast off tow line vied with other in exertion before sun have set have arrived at beach be safely landed in little sand bay into have steered for wind be off shore there be surf boat be hauled up exhausted men lay down on sand till warm with heat of sun forgetting that have eaten drunk for so long time be soon fast asleep captain barentz philip krantz a soon a have seen boat secured held short consultation be then glad to follow example of seaman harassed worn out with fatigue of last twenty four hour sens be soon drowned in oblivion for many hour slept soundly dreamt of water awoke to sad reality that be tormented with thirst be on sandy heath with salt wave mocking reflected how many of late companion have be swallowed up felt thankful that have be spared be early dawn when rose from form have impressed on yielding sand by direction of philip separated in direction to look for mean of quenching agony of thirst a proceeded over sand hill found growing in sand low spongy leaf sort of shrub something like what in greenhouse be termed ice plant thick leaf of be covered with large drop of dew sank down on knee proceeded from one to other licking off moisture be abundant soon felt temporary relief continued search till noon without success hunger be now added to thirst then returned to beach to ascertain if companion have be more successful have also quenched thirst with dew of heaven have found no water mean of subsistence of have eaten leaf of plant have contained dew in morning have found although acid full of watery sap grateful to palate plant in question be one provided by bounteous providence for support of camel other beast in arid desert only to be found there devoured by ruminating animal with avidity by advice of philip collected quantity of plant put into boat then launched be not more than fifty mile from table bay although have sail wind be in favour philip pointed out to how useless be to remain when before morning must in probability arrive at where must obtain required advice be approved of acted upon boat be shoved off oar resumed so tired exhausted be men oar dipped mechanically into water for there be strength left to be applied be not until next morning at daylight that have arrived opposite false bay have still many mile to pull wind in favour have done almost men must do little nothing encouraged however by sight of land knew rallied about noon pulled exhausted to beach at bottom of table bay near to be house fort protecting settler who have for few year resided there landed close to where broad rivulet at season torrent in winter poured stream into bay at sight of fresh water of men dropped oar threw into sea when out of depth others when water be above waist yet did not arrive so soon a who waited till boat struck beach jumped out upon dry land then threw into rivulet coursed over shingle about five six inch in depth allowing refreshing stream to pour into mouth till must receive more immersing hot hand rolling in with delight despot fanatic have exerted ingenuity to invent torment for victim how useless rack boot tire that have imagined be not to be compared to torture of extreme thirst in extremity of agony sufferer cry for water be not refused might have spared refined ingenuity of torment disgusting exhibition of have only confined prisoner in cell refused water a soon a satisfied most pressing of want rose dripping from stream walked up to house of factory inhabitant of perceiving that boat have landed when there be vessel in bay naturally concluded that disaster have happened be walking down to meet tragical history be soon told thirty six men stood before be be left of nearly three hundred soul embarked have be more than two day without food at intimation further question be asked by considerate settler until hunger of sufferer have be appeased when narrative of suffering be fully detailed by philip krantz have idea have seen before observed one of settler did come on shore when fleet anchored did not replied philip have be here recollect now replied man be only survivor of ter schilling be lost in false bay not only survivor replied philip thought so afterwards met pilot one eyed man of name of schriften who be shipmate must have arrived here after saw of course did not one belonging to ter schilling ever came here after for have be settler here ever since be not likely that must forget circumstance must then have returned to holland by other mean know not how ship never go near coast after leave bay be too dangerous nevertheless saw replied philip musing if saw be sufficient perhaps vessel have be blown down to eastern side picked up native in part be not likely to have spared life of european caffre be cruel people information schriften have not be seen at cape be subject of meditation to philip have always have idea a reader know that there be something supernatural about man opinion be corroborated by report of settler must pas over space of two month during wrecked seaman be treated with kindness by settler at expiration of small brig arrived at bay took in refreshment be homeward bound with full cargo being chartered by company must not refuse to receive on board crew of vrow katerina philip krantz seaman embarked captain barentz remained behind to settle at cape must go home said to philip who argued with have nothing in world to return for have wife child have one dear object vrow katerina who be wife child everything be gone never will find vessel like if must must not love a did affection be buried with be entombed in deep sea how beautifully burnt went out of world like phoenix a be will be faithful to will send for what little money have live a near to tomb a can never will forget a long a live will mourn over vrow katerina when die will be found engraven on heart philip must not help wishing that affection have be fixed upon more deserving object a then probably tragical loss have not taken place changed subject feeling that being sailor captain barentz be much better on shore than in command of vessel shook hand parted philip promising to execute barentz commission be to turn money into article most useful to settler have sent out by first fleet must sail from zuyder zee commission be not philip good fortune to execute brig named wilhelmina sailed soon arrived at st helena after watering proceeded on voyage have made western isle philip be consoling with anticipation of soon joining amine when to northward of island met with furious gale before be obliged to scud for many day with vessel head to south east a wind abated be able to haul to fell in with dutch fleet of five vessel commanded by admiral have left amsterdam more than two month have be buffeted about by contrary gale for major part of period cold fatigue bad provision have brought on scurvy ship be so weakly manned that must hardly navigate when captain of wilhelmina reported to admiral that have part of crew of vrow katerina on board be ordered to send immediately to assist in navigating crippled fleet remonstrance be useless philip have time to write to amine acquainting with misfortune disappointment confiding letter to wife a well a narrative of loss of vrow katerina for director to charge of captain of wilhelmina hastened to pack up effect repaired on board of admiral ship with krantz crew to be added six of men belonging to to wilhelmina whom admiral insisted on retaining brig having received admiral despatch be then permitted to continue voyage perhaps there be nothing more trying to seaman feeling than being unexpectedly forced to recommence series of trial at very time when anticipate repose from former yet how often doe happen philip be melancholy be destiny thought using word of amine why must not submit krantz be furious seaman discontented mutinous be useless might be right on vast ocean where there be appeal trial injunction to be obtained hard a case appeared to admiral be fully justified in proceeding ship be almost unmanageable with few hand who must still perform duty small increase of physical power might be mean of saving hundred who lay helpless in hammock in own vessel lion be manned with two hundred fifty men when sailed from amsterdam there be not more than seventy capable of doing duty other ship have suffered in proportion first captain of lion be dead second captain in hammock admiral have one to assist mate of vessel of whom crawled up to duty more dead than alive ship of second in command dort be even in more deplorable plight commodore be dead first captain be still doing duty have one more officer capable of remaining on deck admiral sent for philip into cabin having heard narrative of loss of vrow katerina ordered to go on board commodore ship a captain giving rank of commodore to captain at present on board of krantz be retained on board own vessel a second captain for by philip narrative admiral perceived at once that be good officer brave men chapter eighteen fleet under admiral rymelandt command be ordered to proceed to east indie by western route through strait of magellan into pacific ocean being still imagined notwithstanding previous failure that route offered facility might shorten passage to spice island vessel composing fleet be lion of forty four gun bearing admiral flag dort of thirty six gun with commodore pendant to philip be appointed zuyder zee of twenty young frau of twelve ketch of four gun called schevelling crew of vrow katerina be divided between two larger vessel others being smaller be easier worked with fewer hand arrangement having be made boat be hoisted up ship made sail for ten day be baffled by light wind victim to scurvy increased considerably on board of philip vessel many died be thrown overboard others be carried down to hammock newly appointed commodore whose name be avenhorn went on board of admiral to report state of vessel to suggest a philip have proposed to that must make coast of south america endeavour by bribery by force to obtain supply from spanish inhabitant native to admiral must not listen be imperious bold obstinate man not to be persuaded convinced with little feeling for suffering of others tenacious of being advised immediately rejected proposition have originated with must probably have be immediately acted upon commodore returned on board vessel not only disappointed irritated by language used towards be do captain vanderdecken know too well situation be impossible can continue long at sea if do vessel will be drifting at mercy of wave while crew die wretched death in hammock at present have forty men left in ten day more will probably have twenty for a labour becomes more severe so do drop down faster be not better to risk life in combat with spaniard than die here like rotten sheep perfectly agree with commodore replied philip still must obey order admiral be inflexible man cruel one have great mind to part company in night if find fault will justify to director on return hing rashly perhaps when day by day find own ship company more weakened will see necessity of following advice week have passed away after conversation fleet have made little progress in ship ravage of fatal disease became more serious a commodore have predicted have twenty men really able to do duty have admiral ship other vessel suffered le commodore again went on board to reiterate proposition admiral rymelandt be not only stern vindictive man be aware of propriety of suggestion made by second in command having refused must not acquiesce felt revengeful against commodore whose counsel must now either adopt by refusing be prevented from taking step so necessary for preservation of crew success of voyage too proud to acknowledge in error again did decidedly refuse commodore went back to own ship fleet be then within three day of coast steering to southward for strait of magellan that night after philip have returned to cot commodore went on deck ordered course of vessel to be altered point more to westward night be very dark lion be only ship carried poop lantern so that parting company of dort be not perceived by admiral other ship of fleet when philip went on deck next morning found that consort be not in sight looked at compass perceiving that course be altered inquired at what hour by whose direction finding that be by superior officer of course said nothing when commodore came on deck stated to philip that felt warranted in not complying with admiral order a must have be sacrificing whole ship company be indeed true in two day made land running into shore perceived large town spaniard on beach then anchored at mouth of river hoisted english colour when boat came on board to ask who be what required commodore replied that vessel be english for knew that hatred of spanish to dutch be so great that if known to belong to nation must have have chance of procuring supply except by force stated that have fallen in with spanish vessel complete wreck from whole of crew being afflicted with scurvy that have taken men out who be now in hammock below a considered cruel to leave so many of fellow creature to perish that have come out of course to land at first spanish fort must reach requested that must immediately send on board vegetable fresh provision for sick men whom must be death to remove until after few day when must be little restored added that in return for assisting spaniard trusted governor must also send supply for own people well made up story be confirmed by officer sent on board by spanish governor being requested to go down below see patient sight of so many poor fellow in last stage of horrid disease teeth fallen out gum ulcerated body full of tumour sore be quite sufficient hurrying up from lower deck a must have done from charnel house officer hastened on shore made report in two hour large boat be sent off with fresh beef vegetable sufficient for three day supply for ship company be immediately distributed among men letter of thanks be returned by commodore stating that health be so indifferent a to prevent coming on shore in person to thank governor forwarding pretended list of spaniard on board in mentioned officer people of distinction whom imagined might be connected with family of governor whose name title have received from messenger sent on board for dutch knew full well majority of noble spanish family indeed alliance have continually taken place between previous to assertion of independence commodore concluded letter by expressing hope that in day two must be able to pay respect make arrangement for landing of sick a be anxious to proceed on voyage of discovery on third day fresh supply of provision be sent on board so soon a be received commodore in english uniform went on shore called upon governor gave long detail of suffering of people have rescued agreed that must be sent on shore in two day a must by time be well enough to be moved after many compliment went on board governor having stated intention to return visit on following day if weather be not too rough fortunately weather be rough for next two day be not until third that governor made appearance be precisely what commodore wished there be disease perhaps so dreadful so rapid in effect upon human frame at same time so instantaneously checked a scurvy if remedy can be procured few day be sufficient to restore who be not able to turn in hammock to former vigour in course of six day nearly crew of dort be convalescent able to go on deck still be not cured commodore waited for arrival of governor received with due honour then so soon a be in cabin told very politely that officer with be prisoner that vessel be dutch man of war that be own people not spaniard who have be dying of scurvy consoled however by pointing out that have thought preferable to obtain provision by ruse than to sacrifice life on side by taking by force that excellency captivity must endure no longer than until have received on board sufficient number of live bullock fresh vegetable to insure recovery of ship company in mean time not least insult must be offered to whereupon spanish governor first looked at commodore then at file of armed men at cabin door then to distance from town then called to mind possibility of being taken out to sea weighing point in mind very moderate ransom demanded for bullock be not worth dollar piece in country resolved a must not help to comply with commodore term called for pen ink wrote order to send on board immediately be demanded before sunset bullock vegetable be brought off so soon a be alongside commodore with many bow many thanks escorted governor to gangway complimenting with salvo of great gun a have done before on arrival people on shore thought that excellency have paid long visit a did not like to acknowledge that have be deceived nothing be said about at least in hearing although fact be soon well known a soon a boat be cleared commodore weighed anchor made sail well satisfied with having preserved ship company a falkland island in case of parting company have be named a rendezvous steered for in fortnight arrived found that admiral be not yet there crew be now recovered fresh beef be not yet expended when perceived admiral three other vessel in offing appeared that so soon a dort have parted company admiral have immediately acted upon advice that commodore have given have run for coast not being so fortunate in ruse a second in command have landed armed force from four vessel have succeeded in obtaining several head of cattle at expense of equal number of men killed wounded at same time have collected large quantity of vegetable of one sort have carried on board distributed with great success to sick who be gradually recovering immediately that admiral have anchored made signal for commodore to repair on board taxed with disobedience of order in having left fleet commodore did not deny that have so done excused upon plea of necessity offering to lay whole matter before court of director so soon a returned admiral be vested with most extensive power not only of trial condemnation punishment of person guilty of mutiny insubordination in fleet in reply told commodore that be prisoner to prove confined in iron under half deck signal be then made for captain went on board of course philip be of number on arrival admiral held summary court martial proving to by instruction that be so warranted to do result of court martial must be one condemnation for breach of discipline to philip be obliged reluctantly to sign name admiral then gave appointment of second in command commodore pendant much to annoyance of captain commanding other vessel in admiral proved judgment a there be one of so fit for task a philip having so done dismissed philip must have spoken to late commodore sentry opposed a against order with friendly nod philip be obliged to leave without desired communication fleet remained three week at falkland island to recruit ship company although there be fresh beef there be plenty of scurvy grass penguin bird be in myriad on part of island from propinquity of nest built of mud went by name of town there sat close together whole area covered being bare of grass hatching egg rearing young men have to select a many egg bird a pleased so numerous be that when have supplied there be apparent diminution of number food although in short time not very palatable to seaman have effect of restoring to health before fleet sailed there be not man who be afflicted with scurvy in mean time commodore remained in iron many be conjecture concerning ultimate fate power of life death be known to be in admiral hand one thought that such power must be exerted up on delinquent of so high grade other captain kept aloof from philip knew little of what be general idea occasionally when on board of admiral ship ventured to bring up question be immediately silenced feeling that might injure late commodore for whom have regard must risk nothing by importunity fleet sailed for strait of magellan without anybody being aware of what might be result of court martial be about fortnight after have left falkland island that entered strait at first have leading wind carried half through did not last then have to contend not only against wind against current daily lost ground crew of ship also began to sicken from fatigue cold whether admiral have before made up mind whether irritated by fruitless endeavour to continue voyage be impossible to say after three week useless struggle against wind current hove to ordered captain on board when proposed that prisoner must receive punishment punishment be to be deserted be to be sent on shore with day food where there be mean of obtaining support so a to die miserably of hunger be punishment frequently resorted to by dutch at period a will be seen by reading account of voyage at same time seldom if ever awarded to one of so high rank a of commodore philip immediately protested against so did krantz although be aware that by so doing must make admiral enemy other captain who viewed of with jealous eye considered a interloper interfering with advancement sided with admiral notwithstanding majority philip thought duty to expostulate know well admiral said joined in condemnation for breach of discipline at same time there be much in extenuation committed breach of discipline to save ship company not error in judgment a proved by taking same measure to save own men therefore visit offence of so doubtful nature with such cruelty let company decide point when send home can do so soon a arrive in india be sufficiently punished by losing command to do what propose will be ascribed to feeling of revenge more than to of justice what success can deserve if commit act of such cruelty how can expect merciful providence to protect from wind wave when be thus barbarous towards other philip argument be of avail admiral ordered to return on board ship have be able to find excuse must have deprived of command must not well do philip be aware that admiral be now inveterate enemy commodore be taken out of iron brought into cabin sentence be made known to be so admiral replied avenhorn for to attempt to turn from purpose know must be unavailing be not punished for disobedience of order for having by disobedience pointed out to duty duty be forced to perform afterwards by necessity then be so let perish on black rock a will bone be whitened by chilly blast howl over desolation mark cruel vindictive man will not be only one whose bone will bleach there prophesy that many others will share fate even admiral may be of number if mistake not will lie side by side admiral made reply gave sign for prisoner to be removed then have conference with captain of three smaller vessel a have be all along retarded by heavier sailing of own ship dort commanded by philip decided that must part company proceed on a fast a must to indie sending on board of two larger vessel provision must spare a already began to run short philip have left cabin with krantz after prisoner have be removed then wrote few line upon slip of paper leave beach when be put on shore until vessel be out of sight requesting krantz to find opportunity to deliver to commodore returned on board of own ship when crew of dort heard of punishment about to be inflicted upon old commander be much excited felt that have sacrificed to save murmured much at cruelty of admiral about hour after philip return to ship prison be sent on shore landed on desolate rocky coast with supply of provision for two day not single article of extra clothing mean of striking light be permitted when boat keel grazed beach have be ordered out boat shoved off men be not permitted even to bid farewell fleet a philip have expected remained hove to shifting provision be not till after dark that everything be arranged opportunity be not lost philip be aware that must be considered breach of discipline to that be indifferent neither did think likely that must come to ear of admiral a crew of dort be partial to commodore to have desired seaman whom must trust to put into one of boat couple of musket quantity of ammunition several blanket various other article besides provision for two three month for one person a soon a be dark men pulled on shore with boat found commodore on beach waiting for supplied with necessary then rejoined ship without admiral having least suspicion of what have be done shortly after fleet made sail on wind with head off shore next morning three smaller vessel parted company by sunset have gained many mile to windward after be not again seen admiral have sent for philip to give instruction be very severe evidently framed so a to be able to afford hereafter excuse for depriving of command among others order be a dort drew much le water than admiral ship to sail ahead of during night that if approached too near land a beat across channel timely notice might be given to admiral if in too willow water responsibility be occasion of philip being always on deck when approached land on side of strait be second night after fleet have separated that philip have be summoned on deck a be nearing land of terra del fuego be watching man in chain heaving head when officer of watch reported to that admiral ship be ahead of instead of astern philip made inquiry a to when passed must not discover went forward saw admiral ship with poop light when admiral be astern be not visible what can be admiral reason for thought philip have run ahead for purpose to make charge against of neglect of duty must be so well let do a plea must wait now till arrive in india for will not allow to desert with company have a much rather think a large proprietor more interest than have well a have thought proper to go ahead have nothing to do to follow may come out of chain there ' philip went forward be now a imagined very near to land night be dark must not distinguish for hour continued course much to philip surprise for now thought must make out loom of land dark a be eye be constantly fixed upon ship ahead expecting minute that must go about continued course philip followed with own vessel be very close to land sir observed vander hagen lieutenant who be officer of watch so appears to admiral be closer draw much more water than do replied philip think see rock on beam to leeward sir believe be right replied philip can not understand ready about get gun ready must suppose to be ahead of depend up on hardly have philip given order when vessel struck heavily on rock philip hastened aft found that rudder have be unshipped vessel be immovably fixed thought then reverted to admiral be on shore ran forward admiral be still sailing on with poop light about two cable length ahead of fire gun there cried philip perplexed beyond measure gun be fired immediately followed up by flash report of gun close astern of philip looked with astonishment over quarter perceived admiral ship close astern to evidently on shore a well a own merciful heaven exclaimed philip rushing forward what can be beheld other vessel with light ahead still sailing on leaving day be now dawning there be sufficient light to make out land dort be on shore not fifty yard from beach surrounded by high barren rock yet vessel ahead be apparently sailing on over land seaman crowded on forecastle watching strange phenomenon at last vanished from sight be flying dutchman by be holy cried one of seaman jumping off gun hardly have man uttered word when vessel disappeared philip felt convinced that be so walked away aft in very perturbed state must have be father fatal ship have decoyed to probable destruction hardly knew how to act admiral wrath did not wish just at moment to encounter sent for officer of watch having desired to select crew for boat out of men who have be on deck must substantiate assertion ordered to go on board of admiral state what have happened a soon a boat have shoved off philip turned attention to state of own vessel daylight have increased philip perceived that be surrounded by rock have run on shore between two reef extended mile from mainland sounded round vessel discovered that be fixed from forward to aft that without lightening there be chance of getting off then turned to where admiral ship lay aground found that to appearance be in even worse plight a rock to leeward of be above water be much more exposed must bad weather come on never perhaps be there scene more cheerless appalling dark wintry sea sky loaded with heavy cloud wind cold piercing whole line of coast one mass of barren rock without slightest appearance of vegetation inland part of country presented equally sombre appearance higher point be capped with snow although be not yet winter season sweeping coast with eye philip perceived not four mile to leeward of so little progress have made spot where have deserted commodore surely have be judgment on for cruelty thought philip prophecy of poor avenhorn will come true more bone than will bleach on rock philip turned round again to where admiral ship be on shore started back a beheld sight even more dreadful than that have viewed body of vander hagen officer sent on board of admiral hanging at main yard arm god be possible exclaimed philip stamping with sorrow indignation boat be returning on board philip awaited with impatience men hastened up side breathlessly informed philip that admiral a soon a have heard lieutenant report acknowledgment that be officer of watch have ordered to be hung that have sent back with summons for to repair on board immediately that have seen rope preparing at other yardarm not for sir cried men that will never be will not go on board will defend with life whole ship company joined in resolution expressed determination to resist admiral philip thanked kindly stated intention of not going on board requested that must remain quiet until be ascertained what step admiral might take then went down to cabin to reflect upon what plan must proceed a looked out of stern window perceived body of young man still swinging in wind almost wished that be in place for then there must be end to wayward fate thought of amine felt that for wished to live that phantom ship must have decoyed to destruction be also source of much painful feeling philip meditated with hand pressed to temple be destiny thought at last will of heaven must be done must not have be so deceived if heaven have not permitted then thought reverted to present situation that admiral have exceeded power in taking life of officer be undeniable a although instruction gave power of life death still be only to be decided by sentence of court martial held by captain commanding vessel of fleet therefore felt justified in resistance philip be troubled with idea that such resistance might lead to much bloodshed be still debating how to act when reported to that there be boat coming from admiral ship philip went upon deck to receive officer who stated that be admiral order that must immediately come on board that must consider now under arrest deliver up sword exclaimed ship company of dort will not go on board will stand by captain to last silence men silence cried philip must be aware sir said to officer in cruel punishment of innocent young man admiral have exceeded power much a regret to see symptom of mutiny insubordination must be remembered that if in command disobey order have received by exceeding not only set example give excuse for who otherwise must be bound to obey to do same tell admiral that murder of innocent man have determined no longer to consider under authority will hold a well a answerable to company whom serve for conduct intend to go on board put in power that might gratify resentment by ignominious death be duty owe men under command to preserve life may if possible preserve theirs in strait may also add that little reflection must point out to that be time for to war with to assist other with energy be here shipwrecked on barren coast with provision insufficient for lengthened stay prospect of succour little of escape a commodore truly prophesied many more be likely to perish a well a even admiral may be of number will wait answer if choose to lay aside animosity refer conduct to higher tribunal be willing to join with in rendering assistance to other situation requires if not must perceive of course will tell have with who will defend against attempt at force have answer sir may return on board officer went to gangway found that none of crew except bowman be in boat have gone up to gain from men of dort true history of what imperfectly heard before be summoned to return have received full intelligence coincided with seaman of dort that appearance of phantom ship have occasioned present disaster be judgment upon admiral for conduct in having so cruelly deserted poor commodore upon return of officer with philip answer rage of admiral be beyond bound ordered gun aft must bear upon dort to be double shotted fired into krantz pointed out to that must not bring more gun to bear upon dort in present situation than dort must bring to bear upon that superior force be thus neutralised that advantage must result from taking such step admiral immediately put krantz under arrest proceeded to put into execution insane intention in be however prevented by seaman of lion who neither wished to fire upon consort to be fired at in return report of boat crew have be circulated through ship men felt too much ill will against admiral perceived at same time extreme difficulty of situation to wish to make worse did not proceed to open mutiny went down below when officer ordered up refused to go upon deck officer who be equally disgusted with admiral conduct merely informed of state of ship company without naming individual so a to excite resentment against one in particular such be state of affair when sun went down nothing have be done on board admiral ship for krantz be under arrest admiral have retired in state of fury to cabin in mean time philip ship company have not be idle have laid anchor out astern hove taut have started water be pumping out when boat pulled alongside krantz made appearance on deck captain vanderdecken have come to put under order if will receive if not render protection for a sure a fate must have be hanged to morrow morning if have remained in own ship men in boat have come with same intention that of joining if will permit although philip must have wished have be otherwise must not well refuse to receive krantz under circumstance of case be very partial to to save life certainly be in danger must have done much more desired that boat crew must return when krantz have stated to what have occurred on board lion crew earnestly begged not to send back to almost certain death having effected escape of krantz must have assured philip reluctantly allowed to remain night be tempestuous wind being now off shore water be not rough crew of dort under direction of philip krantz succeeded in lightening vessel so much during night that next morning be able to haul off found that bottom have received no serious injury be fortunate for that have not discontinued exertion for wind shifted few hour before sunrise by time that have shipped rudder came on to blow fresh down strait wind being accompanied with heavy swell admiral ship still lay aground apparently exertion be used to get off philip be much puzzled how to act leave crew of lion must not indeed must refuse did wish to refuse admiral if proposed coming on board now made up mind that must only be a passenger that must retain command at present contented with dropping anchor outside clear of reef where be sheltered by bluff cape under water be smooth about mile distant from where admiral ship lay on shore employed crew in replenishing water cask from rivulet close to where ship be anchored waited to see if other vessel got off being convinced that if did not communication must soon take place a soon a water be complete sent one of boat to place where commodore have be landed having resolved to take on board if must find boat returned without having seen anything of although men have clambered over hill to considerable distance on second morning after philip have hauled vessel off observed that boat of admiral ship be passing repassing from shore landing store provision next day from tent pitched on shore be evident that be abandoned although boat be still employed in taking article out of night blew fresh sea be heavy next morning mast be gone turned on broadside be evidently wreck philip now consulted with krantz how to act to leave crew of lion on shore be impossible must perish when winter set in upon desolate coast on whole be considered advisable that first communication must come from other party philip resolved to remain quietly at anchor be very plain that there be longer subordination among crew of lion who be to be seen in day time climbing over rock in direction at night when large fire be lighted carousing drinking waste of provision be subject of much vexation to philip have not more than sufficient for own crew took for granted that so soon a what have taken on shore must be expended crew of lion must ask to be received on board of dort for more than week did affair continue in state when one morning boat be seen pulling towards ship in stern sheet philip recognised officer who have be sent on board to put under arrest when officer came on deck took off hat to philip do then acknowledge a in command observed philip yes sir most certainly be second in command now be first for admiral be dead dead exclaimed philip how be found dead on beach under high cliff body of commodore be in arm indeed be grappled together be supposed that in walk up to top of hill used to take day to see if vessel might be in strait fell in with commodore that have come to contention have fallen over precipice together one saw meeting must have fallen over rock a body be dreadfully mangled on inquiry philip ascertained that chance of saving lion have be lost after second night when have beat in larboard streak six foot water in hold that crew have be very insubordinate have consumed almost spirit that not only sick have already perished also many others who have fallen over rock when be intoxicated have be found dead in morning from exposure during night then poor commodore prophecy have be fulfilled observed philip to krantz many others even admiral have perished with peace be with now let get away from horrible place a soon a possible philip then gave order to officer to collect men provision remained for immediate embarkation krantz followed soon after with boat before night everything be on board body of admiral commodore be buried where lay next morning dort be under weigh with slanting wind be laying fair course through strait chapter nineteen appeared a if misfortune be to cease after tragical death of two commander in few day dort have passed through strait of magellan be sailing in pacific ocean with blue sky quiet sea ship company recovered health spirit vessel being now well manned duty be carried on with cheerfulness in about fortnight have gained well up on spanish coast although have seen many of inhabitant on beach have not fallen in with vessel belonging to spaniard aware that if met with spanish ship of superior force must attack philip have made preparation have trained men to gun have now with joint crew of vessel well manned ship anticipation of prize money have made men very eager to fall in with spaniard knew that philip must capture if must light wind calm detained for month on coast when philip determined upon running for isle st marie where though knew be in possession of spaniard yet hoped to be able to procure refreshment for ship company either by fair mean by force dort be by reckoning about thirty mile from island having run in until after dark have hove to till next morning krantz be on deck leant over side a sail flapped to mast attempted to define line of horizon be very dark a watched thought that perceived light for moment then disappeared fixing eye on spot soon made out vessel hove to not two cable length distant hastened down to apprise philip procure glass by time philip be on deck vessel have be distinctly made out to be three masted xebeque very low in water after short consultation be agreed that boat on quarter must be lowered down manned armed without noise that must steal gently alongside surprise men be called up silence enjoined in few minute boat crew have possession of vessel having boarded secured hatch before alarm must be given by few who be on deck more men be then taken on board by krantz who a agreed upon lay to under lee of dort until daylight made appearance hatch be then taken off prisoner sent on board of dort there be sixty people on board large number for vessel of description on being interrogated two of prisoner who be well dressed gentlemanlike person stepped forward stated that vessel be from st mary bound to lima with cargo of flour passenger that crew captain consisted of twenty five men rest who be on board have taken that opportunity of going to lima that be among passenger trusted that vessel cargo must be immediately released a two nation be not at war not at war at home grant replied philip in sea constant aggression of armed ship compel to retaliate will therefore make prize of vessel cargo at same time a have wish to molest private individual will land passenger crew at st mary to place be bound in order to obtain refreshment now will expect will be given cheerfully a ransom so a to relieve from resorting to force prisoner protested strongly against without avail then requested leave to ransom vessel cargo offering larger sum than appeared to be worth philip being short of provision refused to part with cargo spaniard appeared much disappointed at unsuccessful issue of request finding that nothing must induce to part with provision then begged hard to ransom vessel to after consultation with krantz philip gave assent two vessel then made sail steered on for island then about four league distant although philip have not wished to retain vessel yet a stood in together superior speed became so manifest that almost repented that have agreed to ransom at noon dort be anchored in road out of gunshot portion of passenger allowed to go on shore make arrangement for ransom of remainder while prize be hauled alongside cargo hoisted into ship towards evening three large boat with livestock vegetable sum agreed upon for ransom of xebeque came alongside a soon a one of boat be cleared prisoner be permitted to go on shore in with exception of spanish pilot who at suggestion of krantz be retained with promise of being released directly dort be clear of spanish sea negro slave be also at own request allowed to remain on board much to annoyance of two passenger before mentioned who claimed man a property insisted that be infraction of agreement have be entered into prove right by own word replied philip agreed to deliver up passenger property slave will remain on board finding endeavour ineffectual spaniard took haughty leave dort remained at anchor night to examine rigging next morning discovered that xebeque have disappeared having sailed unperceived by during night a soon a anchor be up sail made on ship philip went down to cabin with krantz to consult a to best course be followed by negro slave who shutting door looking watchfully round said that wished to speak with information be most important given rather too late vessel have be ransomed be government advice boat fastest sailer spaniard possessed pretended two passenger be officer of spanish navy others be crew of vessel have be sent down to collect bullion take to lima at same time to watch for arrival of dutch fleet intelligence of whose sailing have be time before received overland when dutch fleet made appearance be to return to lima with news spanish force must be detached against further learnt that of supposed cask of flour contained gold doubloon others bar of silver precaution having be taken in case of capture that vessel have now sailed for lima there be doubt reason why spaniard be so anxious not to leave negro on board of dort be that knew that must disclose what now have done a for pilot be man whom spaniard knew must trust for reason have better be careful of must lead dort into difficulty philip now repented that have ransomed vessel a must in probability have to meet cope with superior force before must make way clear out of sea there be help for consulted with krantz be agreed that must send for ship company make acquainted with fact arguing that knowledge of valuable capture have made must induce men to fight well stimulate with hope of further success ship company heard intelligence with delight professed ready to meet double force then by direction of philip cask be brought up on quarter deck opened bullion taken out whole when collected amounted to about million of dollar a near a must estimate distribution of coined money be made from capstan very next day bar of metal being reserved until must be sold value ascertained for six week philip worked vessel up coast without falling in with vessel under sail notice have be given by advice boat a appeared craft large small be at anchor under battery have nearly run up whole coast philip have determined that next day must stretch across to batavia when ship be seen in shore under press of sail running towards lima chase be immediately given water shoaled pilot be asked if must stand on replied in affirmative stating that be now in willowest water that be deeper within leadsman be ordered into chain at first heave lead line broke be sent for dort still carried on under heavy press of sail just then negro slave went up to philip told that have seen pilot with knife in chain that thought must have cut lead line so far through a to occasion being carried away told philip not to trust helm be immediately put down a ship went round touched on bank dragged be again clear scoundrel cried philip so cut lead line negro saw have saved spaniard leaped down from off gun before must be prevented have buried knife in heart of negro maldetto take that for pain cried in fury grinding teeth flourishing knife negro fell dead pilot be seized disarmed by crew of dort who be partial to negro a be from information that have become rich let do with a please said krantz to philip yes replied philip summary justice crew debated few minute then lashed pilot to negro carried off to taffrail there be heavy plunge disappeared under eddying water in wake of vessel philip now determined to shape course for batavia be within few day sail of lima have reason to believe that vessel have be sent out to intercept with favourable wind now stood away from coast for three day made rapid passage on fourth at daylight two vessel appeared to windward bearing down upon that be large armed vessel be evident display of spanish ensign pennant a rounded to about mile to windward soon showed that be enemy proved to be frigate of larger size than dort corvette of twenty two gun crew of dort showed alarm at disparity of force clinked doubloon in pocket vowed not to return to lawful owner if must help flew with alacrity to gun dutch ensign be displayed in defiance two spanish vessel again putting head towards dort that might lessen distance received raking shot somewhat discomposed rounded to at cable length commenced action with great spirit frigate lying on beam corvette on bow of philip vessel after hour determined exchange of broadside fore mast of spanish frigate fell carrying away with maintop mast accident impeded firing dort immediately made sail stood on to corvette crippled with three four broadside then tacked fetched alongside of frigate whose lee gun be still impeded with wreck of foremast two vessel now lay head stern within ten foot of other action recommenced to disadvantage of spaniard in quarter of hour canvas hanging overside caught fire from discharge of gun very soon communicated to ship dort still pouring in most destructive broadside must not be effectually returned after attempt to extinguish flame captain of spanish vessel resolved that vessel must share same fate put helm up running on to dort grappled with attempted to secure two vessel together then raged conflict spaniard attempting to pas grappling chain so a to prevent escape of enemy dutch endeavouring to frustrate attempt chain side of hot vessel be crowded with men fighting desperately struck down falling between two vessel wreck of foremast still prevented from coming into actual collision during conflict philip krantz be not idle by squaring after yard putting sail on forward contrived that dort must pay off before wind with antagonist by manoeuvre cleared of smoke so incommoded having good way on two vessel then rounded to so a to get on other tack bring spaniard to leeward gave manifest advantage soon terminated conflict smoke flame be beat back on spanish vessel fire have communicated to dort be extinguished spaniard be no longer able to prosecute endeavour to fasten two vessel together retreated to within bulwark of own vessel after great exertion dort be disengaged forged ahead of opponent who be soon enveloped in sheet of flame corvette remained few cable length to windward occasionally firing gun philip poured in broadside hauled down colour action might now be considered at end object be to save crew of burning frigate boat of dort be hoisted out only two of must swim one of be immediately despatched to corvette with order for to send boat to assistance of frigate be done major part of surviving crew be saved for two hour gun of frigate a be heated by flame discharged then fire having communicated to magazine blew up remainder of hull sank slowly disappeared among prisoner in uniform of spanish service philip perceived two pretended passenger proving correctness of negro statement two men of war have be sent out of lima on purpose to intercept anticipating with preponderating force easy victory after consultation with krantz philip agreed that a corvette be in such crippled state nation be not actually at war must be advisable to release with prisoner be done dort again made sail for batavia anchored in road three week after combat have taken place found remainder of fleet have be despatched before have arrived there week have taken in cargo be ready to sail for holland philip wrote despatch in communicated to director event of voyage then went on shore to reside at house of merchant who have formerly received until dort must be freighted for voyage home chapter twenty must return to amine who be seated on mossy bank where philip conversed when be interrupted by schriften pilot be in deep thought with eye cast down a if trying to recall past ala for mother power exclaimed be gone gone for ever torment suspense can not

have kept aloof appeared to avoid philip still there be not a before attempt to make ship company disaffected did indulge in usual taunt sneer communication have made to amine have also effect upon philip be more pensive thoughtful attempted to conceal gloom from other when embraced be with mournful feeling that perhaps be indulgence must soon be deprived of at same time steeled heart to endurance prepared to meet worst krantz wondered at change of course must not account for utrecht be not far from andaman isle when krantz who have watched barometer came in early one morning called philip have prospect of typhoon sir said glass weather be threatening then must make snug send down top gallant yard small sail directly will strike top gallant mast will be out in minute philip

be turned up everything of weight be sent below gun be secured now came blast of wind careened ship passed over in minute righted a before then fiercer fiercer still sea although smooth at last appeared white a sheet with foam a typhoon swept along in impetuous career burst upon vessel bowed down to gunnel there remained in quarter of hour hurricane have passed over vessel be relieved sea have risen wind be strong in hour blast again came more wild more furious than first wave be dashed into face torrent of rain descended ship be thrown on beam end thus remained till wild blast have passed away to sweep destruction far beyond leaving behind tumultuous angry sea be nearly over believe sir said krantz be clearing up little to windward have have worst of believe said philip there be worse to come said low voice near to philip be schriften who spoke vessel to windward scudding before gale cried krantz philip looked to windward in spot where horizon be clearest saw vessel under topsail foresail standing right down be large vessel bring glass telescope be brought from cabin before philip must use haze have again gathered up to windward vessel be not to be seen thick again observed philip a shut in telescope must look out for vessel that doe not run too close to have seen doubt sir said krantz after few minute typhoon again raged atmosphere be of murky gloom seemed a if heavy fog have be hurled along by furious wind nothing be to be distinguished except white foam of sea that not distance of cable length where be lost in one dark grey mist storm stay sail yielding to force of wind be rent into strip flogged cracked with noise even louder than gale furious blast again blew over mist cleared up little ship on weather beam close aboard of cried one of men krantz philip sprang upon gunwale beheld large ship bearing right down upon not three cable length distant helm up doe not see will be aboard of cried philip helm up say hard up quick helm be put up a men perceiving imminent danger climbed upon gun to look if vessel altered course down came head sail of utrecht having be carried away to horror perceived that must not answer helm pay off a required ship ahoy roared philip through trumpet gale drove sound back ship ahoy cried krantz on gunwale waving hat be useless down came with water foaming under bow be now within pistol shot of utrecht ship ahoy roared sailor with shout must have be heard be not attended to down came vessel upon now cutwater be within ten yard of utrecht men of utrecht who expected that vessel must be severed in half by concussion climbed upon weather gunwale ready to catch at rope of other vessel climb on board of amine who have be surprised at noise on deck have come out have taken philip by arm trust to shock said philip said more cutwater of stranger touched side one general cry be raised by sailor of utrecht sprang to catch at rigging of other vessel bowsprit be now pointed between mast caught at nothing nothing there be shock concussion of two vessel stranger appeared to cleave through hull passed along in silence cracking of timber falling of mast foreyard passed through mainsail yet canvas be unrent whole vessel appeared to cut through utrecht yet left trace of injury not fast slowly a if be really sawing through by heaving tossing of sea with sharp prow stranger forechains have passed gunwale before philip must recover amine cried at last phantom ship father seaman of utrecht more astounded by marvellous result than by former danger threw down upon deck hastened below prayed others be dumb with astonishment fear amine appeared more calm than not excepting philip surveyed vessel a slowly forced way through beheld seaman on board of coolly leaning over gunwale a if deriding destruction have occasioned looked for vanderdecken on poop of vessel with trumpet under arm beheld image of philip same hardy strong build same feature about same age apparently there must be doubt be doomed vanderdecken see philip said see father even so merciful heaven be be philip overpowered by feeling sank upon deck vessel have now passed over utrecht form of elder vanderdecken be seen to walk aft look over taffrail amine perceived to start turn away suddenly looked down saw schriften shaking fist in defiance at supernatural being again phantom ship flew to leeward before gale be soon lost in mist before amine have turned perceived situation of philip one schriften appeared able to act move caught pilot eye beckoned to with assistance philip be led into cabin chapter twenty three have then seen said philip after have lain down on sofa in cabin for minute to recover while amine bent over have at last seen amine can doubt now philip have now doubt replied amine mournfully take courage philip for want not courage for amine know that appearance portends mischief will surely come let come replied amine calmly have long be prepared for so have yes for self not for have be wrecked often have be saved then why must not suffering suffer least who have most courage to bear up against be woman weak frail in body trust have that within will not make feel ashamed of amine philip will have wailing expression of despair from amine lip if can console will if can assist will come what may if can not serve at least will prove burden to presence in misfortune must unnerve amine will not will add to resolution let fate do worst depend upon amine will be ere long be so replied amine philip be a well showed on deck men be frightened absence will be observed be right said philip rising embracing left cabin be too true then thought amine now to prepare for disaster death warning have come must must know more oh mother mother look down upon thy child in dream reveal mystic art have forgotten then must know more have promised philip unless separated yes that idea be worse than death have sad foreboding courage fails only when think of philip on return to deck found crew of vessel in great consternation krantz appeared bewildered have not forgotten appearance of phantom ship off desolation harbour vessel following destruction second appearance more awful than former quite unmanned when philip came out of cabin be leaning in gloomy silence against weather bulkhead will never reach port again sir said to philip a came up to silence silence men may hear matter not think same replied krantz be wrong replied philip turning to seaman lad that disaster may happen to after appearance of vessel be most probable have seen before more than once disaster did then happen here be alive well therefore doe not prove that can not escape a have before done must do best trust in gale be breaking fast in few hour will have fine weather have met phantom ship before care not how often meet again mr krantz get up spirit men have have hard work must be fatigued very prospect of obtaining liquor appeared to give courage to men hastened to obey order quantity served out be sufficient to give courage to most tearful induce others to defy old vanderdecken whole crew of imp next morning weather be fine sea smooth utrecht went gaily on voyage many day of gentle breeze favouring wind gradually wore off panic occasioned by supernatural appearance if not forgotten be referred to in jest with indifference now have run through strait of malacca entered polynesian archipelago philip order be to refresh call for instruction at small island of boton then in possession of dutch arrived there in safety after remaining two day again sailed on voyage intending to make passage between celebes island of galago weather be still clear wind light proceeded cautiously on account of reef current with careful watch for piratical vessel have for century infested sea be not molested have gained well up among island to north of galago when fell calm vessel be borne to eastward of by current calm lasted several day must procure anchorage at last found among cluster of island near to northern coast of new guinea anchor be dropped sail furled for night drizzling small rain came on weather be thick watch be stationed in part of ship that might not be surprised by pirate proas for current ran past ship at rate of eight nine mile per hour vessel if hid among island might sweep down upon unperceived be twelve o'clock at night when philip who be in bed be awakened by shock thought might be proa running alongside started from bed ran out found krantz who have be awakened by same cause running up undressed shock succeeded ship careened to port philip then knew that ship be on shore thickness of night prevented from ascertaining where be lead be thrown over side found that be lying on shore on sandbank with not more than fourteen foot water on deepest side that be broadside on with strong current pressing further up on bank indeed current ran like mill race minute be swept into willow water on examination found that ship have dragged anchor with cable be still taut from starboard bow did not appear to prevent vessel from being swept further up on bank be supposed that anchor have parted at shank anchor be let go nothing more must be done till daybreak impatiently did wait till next morning a sun rose mist cleared away discovered that be on shore on sandbank small portion of be above water round current ran with great impetuosity about three mile from be cluster of small island with cocoa tree growing on with appearance of inhabitant fear have little chance observed krantz to philip if lighten vessel anchor may not hold will be swept further on be impossible to lay out anchor against force of current at event must try grant that situation be anything satisfactory send hand aft men came aft gloomy dispirited lad said philip why be disheartened be doomed sir knew must be so thought probable that ship must be lost told so loss of ship doe not involve that of ship company nay doe not follow that ship be to be lost although may be in great difficulty a be at present what fear be there for men water be smooth have plenty of time before can make raft take to boat never blow among island have land close under lee let first try what can do with ship if fail must then take care of men caught at idea went to work willingly water cask be started pump set going everything must be spared be thrown over to lighten ship anchor still dragged from strength of current bad holding ground philip krantz perceived that be swept further on bank night came on before quitted toil then fresh breeze sprung up created swell occasioned vessel to heat on hard sand thus did continue until next morning at daylight men resumed labour pump be again manned to clear vessel of water have be started after time pumped up sand told that plank have started that labour be useless men left work philip again encouraged pointed out that must easily save that have to do be to construct raft must hold provision for receive portion of crew who must not be taken into boat after repose men again set to work top sail be struck yard lowered down raft be commenced under lee of vessel where strong current be checked philip recollecting former disaster took great pain in construction of raft aware that a water provision be expended there must be occasion to tow so heavy mass constructed in two part might easily be severed thus boat must have le to tow a soon a circumstance must enable to part with one of night again terminated labour men retired to rest weather continuing fine with very little wind by noon next day raft be complete water provision be safely stowed on board secure dry place be fitted up for amine in centre of one portion spare robe sail everything must prove useful in case of being forced on shore be put in musket ammunition be also provided everything be ready when men came aft pointed out to philip that there be plenty of money on board be folly to leave that wished to carry a much a must away with a intimation be given in way that made evident intended that must be complied with philip did not refuse resolved in own mind that when arrived at place where must exercise authority money must be reclaimed for company to whom belonged men went down below while philip be making arrangement with amine handed cask of dollar out of hold broke open helped quarrelling with other for first possession a cask be opened at last man have obtained a much a must carry have placed spoil on raft with baggage in boat to have be appointed be now ready amine be lowered down took station boat

escaped numbered eighty six soul in in boat there be thirty two rest be on raft being well built full of timber floated high out of water now that sea be so smooth have be agreed upon by philip krantz one of must remain on raft other in one of boat at time raft quitted ship be on raft a wished to consult a soon a discovered direction of current must be most advisable course for to pursue appeared that a soon a current have passed bank took more southerly direction towards new guinea be then debated between whether must must not land on island native of be known to be pusillanimous yet treacherous long debate ensued ended however in resolve not to decide a yet wait see what might occur in mean time boat pulled to westward while current set fast down in southerly direction night came on boat dropped grapnel with have be provided philip be glad to find that current be not near so strong grapnel held boat raft covering up with spare sail with have provided setting watch tired seaman be soon fast asleep have not better remain in one of boat observed krantz suppose to save boat be to leave raft have thought of replied philip have therefore not allowed provision water in boat will not leave for reason true have forgotten that krantz remained on watch philip retired to repose so much needed amine met with open arm have fear philip said rather like wild adventurous change will go on shore build hut beneath cocoa tree will repine when day come brings succour release from desert isle what do require be in hand of one above dear who will act with a plea have to be thankful that be worse replied philip now to rest for will soon be obliged to watch morning dawned with smooth sea bright blue sky raft have be borne to leeward of cluster of uninhabited island of spoke be now without hope of reaching to westward be to be seen on horizon refracted head trunk of cocoa nut tree in direction be resolved that must tow raft breakfast have be served out men have taken to oar when discovered proa full of men sweeping after from one of island to windward that be pirate vessel there must be doubt philip krantz considered that force be more than sufficient to repel must attack be made be pointed out to men arm be distributed to in boat a well a to on raft that seaman might not be fatigued be ordered to lie on oar await coming up of vessel a soon a pirate be within range having reconnoitred antagonist ceased pulling commenced firing from small piece of cannon be mounted on bow grape langridge poured upon wounded several of men although philip have ordered to lie down flat on raft in boat pirate advanced nearer fire became more destructive without opportunity of returning by utrecht people at last be proposed a only chance of escape that boat must attack pirate be agreed to by philip more men be sent in boat krantz took command raft be cast off boat pulled away scarcely have cleared raft when a by one sudden thought turned round pulled away in opposite direction krantz voice be heard by philip sword be seen to sash through air moment afterwards lunged into sea swam to raft appeared that people in boat anxious to preserve money have possession of have agreed among to pull away leave raft to fate proposal for attacking pirate have be suggested with view a soon a be clear of raft put intention into execution in vain have krantz expostulated threatened must have taken life when found that effort be of avail leaped from boat then be lost fear said philip number be so reduced that can not hope to hold out long what think schriften ventured philip addressing pilot who stood near to lost not lost by pirate harm there remark of schriften be correct pirate imagining that in taking to boat people have carried with everything be valuable instead of firing at raft immediately gave chase to boat sweep be now out proa flew over smooth water like sea bird passed raft be at first evidently gaining on boat speed soon slackened a day passed boat then pirate vessel disappeared in southward distance between being apparently much same a at commencement of chase raft being now at mercy of wind wave philip krantz collected carpenter tool have be brought from ship selecting two spar from raft made preparation for stepping mast setting sail by next morning morning dawned first object that met view be boat pulling back towards raft followed closely by pirate men have pulled whole night be worn out with fatigue be presumed that consultation have be held in be agreed that must make sweep so a to return to raft a if gained must be able to defend moreover obtain provision water have not on board at time of desertion be fated otherwise gradually men dropped from oar exhausted into bottom of boat pirate vessel followed with renewed ardour boat be captured one by one booty found be more than pirate anticipated hardly need be said that not one man be spared took place within three mile of raft philip anticipated that next movement of vessel must be towards be mistaken satisfied with booty imagining that there must be no more on raft pirate pulled away to eastward towards island from amongst have first made appearance thus be who expected to escape who have deserted companion deservedly punished whilst who anticipated disaster from desertion discovered that be cause of being saved remaining people on board raft amounted to about forty five philip krantz schriften amine two mate sixteen seaman twenty four soldier who have be embarked at amsterdam of provision have sufficient for three four week of water be very short already not having sufficient for more than three day at usual allowance a soon a mast have be stepped rigged sail set although there be hardly breath of wind philip explained to men necessity of reducing quantity of water be agreed that must be served out so a to extend supply to twelve day allowance being reduced to half pint per day there be debate at time a raft be in two part whether must not be better to cast off smaller one put people on board other proposal be overruled a in first place although boat have deserted number on raft have not much diminished moreover raft must steer much better under sail now that have length than must do if reduced dimension altered shape to square mass of floating wood for three day be calm sun poured down hot beam upon want of water be severely felt who continued to drink spirit suffered most on fourth day breeze sprung up favourably sail be filled be relief to burning brow blistered back a raft sailed on at rate of four mile hour men be gay full of hope land below cocoa nut tree be now distinguishable anticipated that next day must land procure water now so craved for night carried sail next morning discovered that current be strong against that what gained when breeze be fresh lost from adverse current a soon a went down breeze be always fresh in use morning fell calm in evening thus did continue for four day more noon being not ten mile from land next morning swept away to distance having ground to retrace eight day have now passed men worn out with exposure to burning sun became discontented mutinous at one time insisted that raft must be divided that might gain land with other half at that provision must no longer eat must be thrown overboard to lighten raft difficulty under lay be having anchor grapnel to raft boat having carried away with have be taken from ship philip then proposed to men that a everyone of have quantity of dollar money must be sewed up in canvas bag man property separate that with weight to rope must probably be enabled to hold raft against current for one night when must be able next day to gain shore be refused must not risk money fool must sooner part with life by most miserable of death again again be proposed to by philip krantz without success in mean time amine have kept up courage spirit proving to philip valuable adviser comforter in misfortune cheer up philip must say will yet build cottage under shade of cocoa nut tree pas portion if not remainder of life in peace for who indeed be there who must think to find in desolate untrodden region schriften be quiet well behaved talked much with amine with nobody else indeed appeared to have stronger feeling in favour of amine than have ever shown before watched over attended amine must often look up after being silent perceive schriften face wear air of pity melancholy have believed impossible that must have exhibited day passed again neared land again did breeze die away be swept back by current men now arose in spite of endeavour of philip krantz rolled into sea provision store everything one cask of spirit remaining stock of water then sat down at upper end of raft with gloomy threatening look in close consultation night closed in philip be full of anxiety again urged to anchor with money in vain ordered away returned to after part of raft upon amine secure retreat have be erected leant on in deep thought melancholy for imagined that amine be asleep what disturbs philip what disturbs avarice folly of men will die rather than risk hateful money have mean of saving will not there be weight enough in bullion on fore part of raft to hold dozen floating mass such a yet will not risk cursed love of gold make men fool madman villain have now two day water doled out a be drop by drop look at emaciated broken down wasted form yet see how cling to money probably will never have occasion for even if gain land be distracted suffer philip suffer from privation have be careful thought that must come have saved water biscuit have here four bottle drink philip will relieve philip drank did relieve for excitement of day have pressed heavily on thanks amine thanks dearest feel better now good heaven be such fool a to value dross of metal above one drop of water in time of suffering privation such a night closed in a before star shone bright there be moon philip have risen at midnight to relieve krantz from steerage of raft usually men have lain about in part of raft night majority of remained forward philip be communing with own bitter thought when heard scuffle forward voice of krantz cry out to for help quitted helm seizing cutlas ran forward where found krantz down men securing fought way to be seized disarmed cut away cut away be called out by who held in few second philip have misery to behold after part of raft with amine upon drifted apart from one on stood for mercy sake wife amine for heaven sake save cried philip struggling in vain to disengage amine also who have run to side of raft held out arm be in vain be separated more than cable length philip made one more desperate struggle then fell down deprived of sense motion chapter twenty four be not until day have dawned that philip opened eye discovered krantz kneeling at side at first thought be scattered confused felt that dreadful calamity have happened to must not recall to mind what be at last rushed upon buried face in hand take comfort said krantz will probably gain shore to day will go in search of a soon a can then be separation cruel death to wretch schriften prophesied to thought philip cruel indeed to waste away to skeleton under burning sun without one drop of water left to cool parched tongue at mercy of wind wave drifting about alone alone separated from husband in whose arm must have died without regret maddened with suspense with thought of what may be suffering what may have be fate pilot be right there can be more cruel death to fond doting wife oh head reel what have philip vanderdecken to live for now krantz offered such consolation a friendship must suggest in vain then talked of revenge philip raised head after few minute thought rose yes replied revenge revenge upon dastard traitor tell krantz how many can trust half of men must think at least be surprise spar have be fitted a rudder raft have now gained nearer shore than ever have done before men be in high spirit at prospect man be sitting on own store of dollar in eye increased in value in proportion a did prospect of escape philip discovered from krantz that be soldier most indifferent seaman who have mutinied on night before cut away other raft that best men have remained neuter so will be now imagine continued krantz prospect of gaining shore have in manner reconciled to treachery of companion probably replied philip with bitter laugh know what will rouse send here to philip talked to seaman whom krantz have sent over to pointed out to that other men be traitor not to be relied upon that must sacrifice everything everybody for own gain that have already done so for money that must have security either on raft on shore with such people that dare not sleep for fear of having throat cut that be better at once to get rid of who must not be true to other that must facilitate escape that must divide between money others have secured by must double own share that have be intention although have said nothing to enforce restoration of money for benefit of company a soon a have gained civilised port where authority must interfere that if consented to join aid must now give whole of for own use what will not desire of gain effect be therefore to be wondered at that men who be indeed little better than who be thus in desire of retaliation denounced by philip consented to proposal be agreed that if did not gain shore others must be attacked very night tossed into sea consultation with philip have put other party on alert too held council kept arm by side a breeze died away be not two mile from land once more drifted back into ocean philip mind be borne down with grief at loss of amine recovered to certain degree when thought of revenge that feeling stayed up often felt edge of cutlas impatient for moment of retribution be lovely night sea be now smooth a glass not breath of air moved in heaven sail of raft hung listless down mast be reflected upon calm surface by brilliancy of starry night alone be night for contemplation for examination of oneself adoration of deity here on frail raft be huddled together more than forty being ready for combat for murder for spoil party pretended to repose yet be quietly watching motion of other with hand upon weapon signal be to be given by philip be to let go halyard of yard so that sail must fall down upon portion of other party entangle by philip direction schriften have taken helm krantz remained by side yard sail fell clattering down then work of death commenced there be parley suspense man started upon foot raised sword voice of philip of krantz alone be heard philip sword did work be nerved to revenge never must be satiated a long a one remained who have sacrificed amine a philip have expected many have be covered up entangled by falling of sail work be thereby made easier fell where stood others reeled back sunk down under smooth water others be pierced a floundered under canvas in few minute work of carnage be complete schriften meanwhile looked on ever anon gave vent to chuckling laugh demoniacal strife be over philip stood against mast to recover breath so far art thou revenged amine thought oh be paltry life compared to thine now that revenge be satiated must do more be covered face up in hand wept bitterly while who have assisted be already collecting money of slain for distribution men when found that three only of side have fallen lamented that there have not be more a own share of dollar must have be increased there be now thirteen men besides philip krantz schriften left upon raft a day dawned breeze again sprung up shared out portion of water must have be allowance of companion who have fallen hunger felt not water revived spirit although philip have have little to say to schriften since separation from amine be very evident to to krantz that pilot former bitter feeling have returned chuckle sarcasm be incessant eye be now a maliciously directed to philip a be when first met be evident that amine alone have for time conquered disposition that with disappearance have vanished good will of schriften towards husband for philip cared little have much more serious weight on heart loss of dear amine felt reckless indifferent concerning anything else breeze now freshened expected that in two hour must run on beach be disappointed step of mast gave way from force of wind sail fell upon raft occasioned great delay before must repair mischief wind again subsided be left about mile from beach tired worn out with feeling philip at last fell asleep by side of krantz leaving schriften at helm slept soundly dreamt of amine thought be under grove of cocoa nut in sweet sleep that stood by watched that smiled in sleep murmured philip when suddenly be awakened by unusual movement half dreaming still thought that schriften pilot have in sleep be attempting to gain relic have passed chain over head be removing quietly from underneath neck portion of chain in reclining posture lay upon startled at idea threw up hand to seize arm of wretch found that have really seized hold of schriften who be kneeling by in possession of chain relic struggle be short relic be recovered pilot lay at mercy of philip who held down with knee on chest philip replaced relic on bosom excited to madness rose from body of now breathless schriften caught in arm hurled into sea man devil care not exclaimed philip breathless escape now if can struggle have already roused up krantz others not in time to prevent philip from wreaking vengeance upon schriften in few word told krantz what have passed a for men cared not laid head down again satisfied that money be safe inquired further philip watched to see if schriften must rise up again try to regain raft did not make appearance above water philip felt satisfied chapter twenty five what pen must portray feeling of fond doting amine when first discovered that be separated from husband in state of bewilderment watched other raft a distance between increased at last shade of night hid from aching eye dropped down in mute despair gradually recovered turning round exclaimed who be here answer who be here cried in louder voice alone alone philip gone mother mother look down upon unhappy child amine frantically threw down so near to edge of raft that long hair have fallen down floated on wave ah where be cried amine after remaining in state of torpor for hour sun glared fiercely upon dazzled eye a opened cast on blue wave close by beheld large shark motionless by side of raft waiting for prey recoiling from edge started up turned round beheld raft vacant truth flashed on oh philip philip cried then be true be gone for ever thought be only dream recollect now yes amine sank down again upon cot have be placed in centre of raft remained motionless for time demand for water became imperious seized one of bottle drank yet why must drink eat why must wish to preserve life rose looked round horizon sky water nothing more be death be to die cruel death prophesied by schriften lingering death under burning sun while vitals be parched within be so fate dare thee to thy worst can die once without care to live yet may see again continued amine hurriedly after pause yes may who know then welcome life will nurse thee for bare hope bare indeed with naught to feed on let see be here still amine looked at zone perceived dagger be still in well then will live since death be at command be guardful of life for dear husband sake amine threw on resting place that might forget thing did from that morning till noon of next day remained in state of torpor when again rose be faint again looked round there be sky water to be seen oh solitude be horrible death must be release must not die must live for philip refreshed with water few piece of biscuit folded arm across breast few more day without relief must be over be ever woman situated a be yet dare to indulge hope why 't be madness why be thus singled out because have wedded with philip may be so if so welcome wretch who thus severed from husband who to save own life sacrificed helpless woman nay might have saved if have have least pity never felt be christian creed that old priest must have have yes that philip must have have embrace charity good will talk of have never seen practise loving one forgiving one say rather hating preying upon one creed never practised why if not practised of what value be creed be better abjure if be saved will abjure still for ever shade of mother be have listened to men have to win husband love tried to forget thou taughtest even when child at thy foot that faith forefather for thousand of year lived died in creed proved by work obedience to prophet willis for be punished tell oh tell in dream night closed in with gloom rose heavy cloud lightning darted through firmament ever anon lighting up raft at last flash be so rapid not following other darting down from quarter at once that whole firmament appeared a if on fire thunder rolled along heaven now near loud then rumbling in distance breeze rose up fresh wave tossed raft washed occasionally even to amine foot a stood in centre of like be far better than calm withering heat rous said amine a cast eye up watched forked lightning till vision became obscured yes be a must be

daylight wind still continued fresh sky cleared sun shone out amine remained shivering in wet garment heat of sun proved too powerful for exhausted state brain wandered rose up in sitting posture looked around saw verdant field in direction cocoa nut waving to wind imagined even that saw own philip in distance hastening to held out arm strove to get up run to meet limb refused office called to screamed sank back exhausted on resting place chapter twenty six must for time return to philip follow strange destiny few hour after have thrown pilot into sea gained shore so long looked at with anxiety suspense spar of raft jerked by running swell undulated rubbed against other a rose fell to wave breaking on beach breeze be fresh surf be trifling landing be without difficulty beach be shelving of firm white sand interspersed strewed with various brilliant coloured shell here there bleached fragment bone of animal have be forced out of element to die island be like others covered with thick wood of cocoa nut tree whose top waved to breeze bowed to blast producing shade freshness must have be duly appreciated by other party than present with exception only of krantz for philip thought of nothing lost wife seaman thought of nothing of sudden wealth krantz supported philip to beach led to shade after minute rose running down to nearest point looked anxiously for portion of raft held amine be now far far away krantz have followed aware now first paroxysm be past there be fear of philip throwing away life gone gone for ever exclaimed philip pressing hand to ball of eye not so philip same providence have preserved will certainly assist be impossible that can perish among so many island many of be inhabited woman will be certain of kind treatment if must only think so replied philip little reflection may induce to think that be rather advantage than otherwise that be thus separated not from from so many lawless companion whose united force must not resist do think that after lengthened sojourn on island people with must permit to remain in quiet possession of wife must respect law amine have in opinion be miraculously preserved from shame ill treatment if not from death durst not surely well krantz must make raft follow must not remain here will seek through wide world be so if wish philip will follow fortune replied krantz glad to find that there be something however wild idea for mind to feed on now let return to raft seek refreshment so much require after will consider what may be best plan to pursue to philip who be much exhausted tacitly consented followed krantz to where raft have be beached men have left be of sitting apart from one under shade of own chosen cocoa nut tree article have be saved on raft have not be landed krantz called upon to come carry thing on shore one must answer obey sat watching money afraid to leave lest must be dispossessed of by others now that life be comparatively speaking safe demon of avarice have taken full possession of soul there sat exhausted pining for water longing for sleep yet dared not move be fixed a if by wand of enchanter be cursed dollar have turned brain observed krantz to philip let try if can not manage to remove what most stand in need of then will search for water philip krantz collected carpenter tool best arm ammunition a possession of latter must give advantage in case of necessity then dragged on shore sail small spar of carried up to clump of cocoa nut tree about hundred yard from beach in hour have erected humble tent put into what have brought with with exception of major part of ammunition a soon a be screened by tent krantz buried in heap of dry sand behind then for immediate want cut down with axe small cocoa nut tree in full bearing must be for who have suffered agony of prolonged thirst to know extreme pleasure with milk of nut be one after other poured down parched throat of krantz philip men witnessed enjoyment in silence with gloating eye time that fresh cocoa nut be seized content quaffed by officer more sharp agonising be own devouring thirst still closer did dry lip glue together yet moved not although felt torture of condemned evening closed in philip have thrown down on spare sail have fallen asleep when krantz set off to explore island upon have be thrown be small not exceeding three mile in length at one part more than five hundred yard across water there be none unless be to be obtained by digging fortunately young cocoa nut prevented absolute necessity for on return krantz passed men in respective station be awake raised on elbow to ascertain if be assailant perceiving krantz again dropped down krantz passed raft water be now quite smooth for wind have shifted off shore spar composed raft hardly jostled other stepped upon a moon be bright in heaven took precaution of collecting arm have be left throwing a far a must into sea then walked to tent where found philip still sleeping soundly in few minute be reposing by side philip dream be of amine thought that saw hated schriften rise again from water climbing up to raft seat by side thought that again heard unearthly chuckle scornful laugh a unwelcome word fell upon distracted ear thought that fled into sea to avoid schriften that water appeared to reject floated on surface storm rose once more beheld in sea shell skimming over wave again be in furious surf on beach shell sank be buried in wave then saw walking on shore without fear without harm for water spared one appeared to spare philip tried to join be prevented by unknown power amine waved hand said will meet again philip yes once more on earth will meet again sun be high in heaven scorching in heat when krantz first opened eye awakened philip axe again procured for morning meal philip be silent be ruminating upon dream have afforded consolation will meet again thought yes once more at least will meet again providence thank thee krantz then stepped out to ascertain condition of men found faint so exhausted that must not possibly survive much longer yet still watching over darling treasure be melancholy to witness such perversion of intellect krantz thought of plan might save life proposed to separately that must bury money so deep that be not to be recovered without time must prevent one from attacking treasure of other without being perceived attempt frustrated must enable to obtain necessary food refreshment without danger of being robbed to plan acceded krantz brought out of tent only shovel in possession one by one buried dollar many foot deep in yielding sand when have secured wealth brought one of ax cocoa nut tree fell be restored to new life vigour having satiated then lay down upon several spot under have buried dollar be soon enjoying that repose so much needed philip krantz have now many serious consultation a to mean must be taken for quitting island going in search of amine for although krantz thought latter part of philip proposal useless did not venture to say so to quit island be necessary provided gained one of be inhabited be that must expect a for amine considered that be dead before having be washed off raft that body be lying on exposed to decomposing heat of torrid sun to cheer philip expressed otherwise whenever talked about leaving island be not to save own life invariably to search after philip lost wife plan proposed acted upon be to construct light raft centre to be composed of three water cask sawed in half in row behind other firmly fixed by cross piece to two long spar on side under sail must move quickly through water be manageable so a to enable to steer course outside spar have be selected hauled on shore work be already in progress be left alone in work for seaman appeared to have idea at present of quitting island restored by food repose be now not content with money have be anxious for more portion of party wealth have be dug up now gambled day with pebble have collected on beach with have invented game evil have crept among have cut step in largest cocoa nut tree with activity of seaman have mounted by tapping top of tree fixing empty cocoa nut underneath have obtained liquor in first fermentation be termed toddy be afterwards distilled into arrack a toddy be quite sufficient to intoxicate day scene of violence intoxication accompanied with oath execration became more more dreadful loser tore hair rushed like madman upon who have gained dollar krantz have fortunately thrown weapon into sea have saved a well a ammunition have secreted blow bloodshed therefore be continual loss of life there be none a contending party be separated by others who be anxious that play must not be interrupted such have be state of affair for now nearly fortnight while work of raft have slowly proceeded of men have lost have by general consent of who have won wealth be banished to certain distance that might not pilfer from walked gloomily round island on beach seeking instrument by might avenge obtain repossession of money krantz philip have proposed to men to join leave island have sullenly refused axe be now never parted with by krantz cut down what cocoa nut tree required for subsistence prevented men from notching more tree to procure mean of inebriation on sixteenth day money have passed into hand of three men who have be more fortunate than rest loser be now by far more numerous party consequence be that next morning three men be found lying strangled on beach money have be re divided gambling have re commenced with more vigour than ever how can end exclaimed philip to krantz a looked upon blackened countenance of murdered men in death of replied krantz can not prevent be judgment raft be now ready sand have be dug from beneath so a to allow water to flow in float be now made fast to stake riding on peaceful water large store of cocoa nut old young have be procured put on board of be intention of philip krantz to have quitted island next day unfortunately one of men when bathing have perceived arm lying in willow water have dived down procured cutlas others have followed example have armed induced philip krantz to sleep on board of raft keep watch night a play be going on heavy loss on one side ended in general fray combat be furious for be more le excited by intoxication result be melancholy for only three be left alive philip with krantz watched issue man who fell wounded be put to sword three left who have be fighting on same side rested panting on weapon after pause two of communicated with other result be attack upon third man who fell dead beneath blow merciful father be thy creature exclaimed philip replied krantz worshipped devil a mammon do imagine that two who must now divide more wealth than must well spend if return to country will consent to division never must have yes krantz have hardly expressed opinion when one of men taking advantage of other turning round moment from passed sword through back man fell with groan sword be again passed through body said not so treacherous villain will not reap reward continued krantz levelling musket held in hand shooting dead have done wrong krantz have saved from punishment deserved left alone on island without mean of obtaining subsistence must have perished miserably by inch with money round must have be torture indeed perhaps be wrong if so may providence forgive must not help let go ashore for be now on island alone must collect treasure bury so that may be recovered at same time take portion with for who know that may have occasion for tomorrow have better remain here for will have enough to do in burying body of infatuated men wealth have caused destruction philip agreed to propriety of suggestion next day buried body where lay treasure be collected in deep trench under cocoa nut tree carefully marked with axe about five hundred piece of gold be selected taken on board of raft with intention of secreting about person resorting to in case of need following morning hoisted sail quitted island need be said in what direction steered a may be well imagined in quarter where have last seen raft with isolated amine chapter twenty seven raft be found to answer well although progress through water be not very rapid obeyed helm be under command philip krantz be very careful in taking such mark observation of island a must enable if necessary to find again with current to assist now proceeded rapidly to southward in order that might examine large island lay in direction object after seeking for amine be to find out direction of ternate king of knew to be at variance with portuguese who have fort factory at tidore not very far distant from from thence to obtain passage in one of chinese junk on way to bantam called at island towards evening have neared large island soon ran down close to beach philip eye wandered in direction to ascertain whether anything on shore indicated presence of amine raft must perceive nothing of kind did see inhabitant that might not pas object of search during night ran raft on shore in small cove where water be quite smooth remained there until next morning when again made sail prosecuted voyage krantz be steering with long sweep have fitted for purpose when observed philip who have be for time silent take from breast relic wore gaze attentively upon be that picture philip observed krantz ala be destiny replied philip answering without reflection destiny what mean did say destiny hardly know what said replied philip replacing relic in bosom rather think said more than intended replied krantz at same time something near truth have often perceived with trinket in hand have not forgotten how anxious schriften be to obtain consequence of attempt upon be there not secret mystery attached to surely if so must now sufficiently know a friend to feel worthy of confidence that be friend krantz feel sincere much valued friend for have shared much danger together be sufficient to make friend must trust believe feel a if dare not trust one there be mystery attached to relic for relic be a yet have be confided to wife holy men alone if trusted to holy men surely may be trusted to sincere friendship than nothing be more holy have presentiment that knowledge of secret must prove fatal to why feel such presentiment know not feel krantz can not afford to lose valued friend will not then make use of friendship appears replied krantz have risked life with before now be not to be deterred from duty of friendship by childish foreboding on part result of agitated mind weakened body can anything be more absurd than to suppose that secret confided to can be pregnant with danger unless be indeed that zeal to assist may lead into difficulty be not of prying disposition have be so long connected together be now so isolated from rest of world that appears to must be solace to be to confide in one whom can trust what evidently have long preyed upon mind consolation advice of friend philip be not to be despised will feel relieved if able to talk over with subject evidently oppresses if therefore value friendship let share with in sorrow there be few who have passed through life so quietly a not to recollect how much grief have be assuaged by confiding cause to listening to counsel consolation of dear friend must not therefore appear surprising situated a be oppressed with loss of amine philip must regard krantz a one to whom might venture to confide important secret commenced narrative with injunction for felt that if krantz must not respect secret for secret sake from good will towards be not likely to be bound by promise a during day raft passed by various small cape headland of island poured into krantz ear history reader be acquainted with now know said philip with deep sigh a narrative be concluded what think do credit strange tale do imagine a well must that be mere phantom of disordered brain that be not so philip believe replied krantz for too have have ocular proof of correctness of part of history remember how often have seen phantom ship if father be permitted to range over sea why must not be selected permitted to reverse doom fully believe word that have told since have told can comprehend much that in behaviour at time appeared unaccountable there be many who must pity philip envy envy cried philip yes envy gladly must take burden of doom on own shoulder be only possible be not splendid thought that be summoned to so great purpose that instead of roaming through world a do in pursuit of wealth possibly may lose after year of cost hardship by venture of day at event must leave behind be selected to fulfil great glorious work work of angel may say that of redeeming soul of father suffering indeed for human frailty not doomed to perish for eternity have indeed object of pursuit worthy of hardship danger of maritime life if end in death what then where else end futile craving continual toil after nothing must die how few who indeed besides yourself be ever permitted before death to ransom soul of author of existence yes philip envy think speak like amine too be of wild ardent soul must mingle with being of other world hold intelligence with disembodied spirit be right replied krantz there be event in life rather connected with family have often fully convinced that be not only possible permitted story have only corroborated what already believed indeed krantz indeed yes of hereafter night be closing in must again put little bark in safety for night there be cove think appears suited for purpose before morning strong breeze right on shore have sprung up surf became so high a to endanger raft to continue course be impossible must only haul up raft to prevent being dashed to piece by force of wave a sea broke on shore philip thought be a usual upon amine a watched tossing water a sunbeam lightened up crest exclaimed ocean hast thou amine if so give up thy dead what be continued pointing to speck on horizon sail of small craft of description replied krantz apparently coming down before wind to shelter in very nook have selected be right be sail of vessel of one of peroquas skim over sea how rise on swell be full of men apparently peroqua rapidly approached be soon close to beach sail be lowered be backed in through surf resistance be useless must prove enemy observed philip will soon know fate people in peroqua took notice of until craft have be hauled up secured three of then advanced towards philip krantz with spear in hand evidently with hostile intention one addressed in portuguese asking who be be hollander replied philip part of crew of vessel be wrecked inquired yes have nothing to fear be enemy to portuguese so be belong to island of ternate king be at war with portuguese who be villain where be companion on island be dead replied philip may ask whether have fallen in with woman who be adrift on part of raft by have heard of have heard that woman be picked up on beach to southward carried away by tidore people to portuguese settlement on supposition that be portuguese then god be thanked be saved cried philip merciful heaven accept thanks to tidore said

having have interruption to fine weather father mathias have returned to lisbon when quitted ternicore tired of idleness have again volunteered to proceed a missionary to india have arrived at formosa shortly after arrival have received direction from superior to return on important business to goa thus be that fell in with amine at tidore must be difficult to analyse feeling of father mathias towards amine varied so often at one moment must call to mind kindness shown to by philip regard have for husband many good quality acknowledged that possessed now must recollect disgrace unmerited disgrace have suffered through mean must then canvas whether really did believe intruder in chamber for other motif than actuated whether have taken advantage of indiscretion account be nearly balanced in mind must have forgiven if have thought that amine be sincere convert to church strong conviction that be not only unbeliever that practised forbidden art turned scale against watched narrowly when in conversation showed religious feeling heart warmed towards when on contrary word escaped lip seemed to show that thought lightly of creed then full tide of indignation vengeance poured into bosom be in crossing bay of bengal to pas round southern cape of ceylon that first met with bad weather when storm increased superstitious seaman lighted candle before small image of saint be shrined on deck amine observed smiled with scorn a did so almost unwittingly perceived that eye of father mathias be earnestly fixed upon papoose have just left do worse than worship idol be termed idolater muttered amine what then be christian must not be better below said mathias coming over to amine be time for woman to be on deck must be better employed in offering up prayer for safety nay

almighty be not only to be worshipped in work in closet with meditation self examination faith hast thou followed up precept thou hast be taught hast thou reverenced sublime mystery have be unfolded to thee have done best father replied amine turning away head watching rolling wave hast thou called upon holy virgin upon saint intercessor for mortal erring like amine made answer did not wish to irritate priest neither must tell untruth answer child continued priest with severity father replied amine have appealed to god alone god of christian god of whole universe who belief not everything belief nothing young woman thought a much saw thee smile with scorn just now why didst thou smile at own thought good father say rather at true faith shown by others amine made answer thou art still unbeliever heretic beware young woman beware beware of what good father why must beware be there not million in clime more unbelieving more heretic perhaps than how many have converted to faith what trouble what toil what danger have not undergone to propagate creed why do succeed so ill will tell father be because people have already have creed of own creed taught to from infancy acknowledged by who live about be not in same position be brought up in creed can expect that can be dismissed prejudice of early year at once eradicated have thought much of what have told have felt that much be true that tenet of creed be godlike be not that much yet be not content must have blind acknowledgment blind obedience be then unworthy convert will soon be in port then teach convince if will be ready to examine confess on conviction only have patience good father time may come when may feel what now yon bit of painted wood be thing to bow down to adore notwithstanding taunt at close of speech there be so much truth in observation of amine that father mathias felt power a wife of catholic have be accustomed to view amine a one who have backslided from church of rome not a one who have be brought up in creed now recalled to mind that have never yet be received into church for father seysen have not considered a in proper state to be admitted have deferred baptism until be satisfied of full belief speak boldly speak a feel child replied father mathias after pause will when arrive at goa talk over thing with blessing of god new faith will be made manifest to so be

coming way after conversation with alteration in manner of portuguese commandant who have highest respect for nobility be most marked treated philip with respect be observable to in fort be until krantz have explained cause source of astonishment to philip commandant often introduced subject to krantz sounded a to whether conduct towards philip have be such a to have made favourable impression for little man now hoped that through influential channel might reap benefit day after conversation a be three seated at table corporal entered saluting commandant informed that dutch sailor have arrived at fort wished to know whether must be admitted philip krantz turned pale at communication have presentiment of evil said nothing sailor be ordered in in few minute who must make appearance

nothing more said vanderdecken must spurn contemptible withered wretch like be a free a wind go on go on will be turn soon corporal throw two men into dungeon sentry at door till further order away with most noble sir perhaps influential friend in holland spain will enable to get out again philip krantz be led away by soldier who be very much surprised at change of treatment schriften followed a walked across rampart to stair led to prison krantz in fury burst from soldier bestowed kick upon schriften sent several foot forward on face be good one cried schriften smiling looking at krantz a regained leg there be eye however met with intelligent glance a descended stair to dungeon be that of soldier pedro told that there be one friend upon whom must rely who must spare endeavour to assist in new difficulty be consolation to ray of hope cheered a once more descended narrow step heard heavy key turned again secured in dungeon chapter thirty three thus be hope wrecked said philip mournfully what chance have now of escaping from little tyrant chance turn up replied krantz at present prospect be not very cheering let hope for best have idea in head may probably be turned to account continued krantz a soon a little man fury be over be that much a like wife there be something like quite a well money now a know where treasure be concealed think may be tempted to offer liberty if be to promise to put into possession be not impossible confound little malignant wretch schriften certainly be not a say of world have be persecutor through life appears to act from impulse not own then must be part portion of destiny be thinking whether noble commandant intends to leave without anything to eat drink must not be surprised that will attempt life be convinced not that can take may however add to suffering a soon a commandant have recovered from fury ordered schriften in to be examined more particularly after search made for schriften be nowhere to be found sentry at gate declared that have not passed new search be ordered in vain even dungeon gallery below be examined without success can be locked up with other prisoner thought commandant impossible will go see descended opened door of dungeon looked in be about to return without speaking when krantz said well signor be kind treatment after having lived so long so amicably together to throw into prison merely because fellow declares that be not what represented to be perhaps will allow little water to drink commandant confused by extraordinary disappearance of schriften hardly knew how to reply at last said in milder tone than be to be anticipated will order to bring signor then closed door of dungeon disappeared strange observed philip appears more pacified already in few minute door be again

have charge of pedro hope so well tell commandant that when be ready to listen to have something of importance to communicate pedro went out now philip can frighten little man into allowing to go free if will consent to say that be not husband of amine can not do krantz will not utter such falsehood be afraid so yet appears to that may avail ourselves of duplicity to meet cruelty injustice unless do a propose hardly know how can manage however will try what can do will assist in way except disclaiming wife never will do well then will see if can make up story will suit party let think krantz

for treatment of permit to return to former apartment will there explain to most strange interesting history commandant more confused than ever hardly knew how to act at last bowed to philip begged that must consider at liberty continued to krantz will be most happy at immediate explanation of affair for everything appears so contradictory must until be explained will follow into own room courtesy must not expect from noble friend who be not little indignant at treatment of commandant went out leaving door open philip krantz followed former retiring to own apartment latter bending step after commandant to sitting room confusion whirled in brain of commandant made appear most ridiculous hardly knew whether to be imperative civil whether be really speaking to first mate of vessel to party whether have insulted noble be cajoled by captain of vessel threw down on sofa krantz taking seat in chair stated a follows have be partly deceived partly not commandant when first came here not knowing what treatment might receive concealed rank afterwards made known to rank of friend on shore did not think while to say anything about situation on board of vessel fact be a may well suppose

be hushed up young man took possession of father wealth be fully expected that there must now be rioting squandering on part of heir a be usually case on contrary never spent anything appeared to be a poor even poorer than ever be instead of being gay merry be in appearance most miserable downcast person in world wandered about seeking crust of bread wherever must find said that have be inoculated by father be a great miser a father have be others shook head said that be not right at last after pining away for six seven year young man died at early age without confession absolution in fact be

supply larger proportion than be share stating that krantz have long voyage must require pointing out to that there be plenty of cocoa nut for support soldier who thought of nothing newly acquired wealth allowed to do a pleased having hastily collected a many cocoa nut a must to add to stock of provision before noon philip krantz have embarked made sail in peroqua leaving soldier with knife again drawn so busy in angry altercation a to be heedless of departure there will be same scene over again expect observed krantz a vessel parted swiftly from shore have little doubt of observe even now be at blow stab if be to name spot must be accursed isle ' must not other be same with so much to inflame passion of men assuredly what curse be gold what blessing replied krantz be sorry pedro be left with be destiny replied philip so let think more of now what do propose with vessel small a be may sail over sea in safety have imagine provision sufficient for more than month idea be to run into track of vessel going to westward obtain passage to goa if meet with can at event proceed up strait a far a pulo penang without risk there may safely remain until vessel pass agree with be best nay only place unless indeed be to proceed to cochin where junk be always leaving for goa must be out of way junk can not well pas in strait without being seen by have difficulty in steering course island by day clear star by night be compass be true that did not follow more direct track followed more secure working up smooth water gaining to northward more than to west many time be chased by malay proas infested island swiftness of little peroqua be security indeed chase be generally speaking abandoned a soon a smallness of vessel be made out by pirate who expected little booty be to be gained amine philip mission be constant theme of discourse may easily be imagined one morning a be sailing between isle with le wind than usual philip observed krantz said that there be event in own life connected with must corroborate mysterious tale confided to will now tell to what referred certainly replied krantz have often thought of doing so one circumstance have hitherto prevented be however fitting opportunity prepare therefore to listen to strange story quite a strange perhaps a own take for granted that have heard people speak of hartz mountain observed krantz have never heard people speak of can recollect replied philip have read of in book of strange thing have occurred there be indeed wild region rejoined krantz many strange tale be told of strange a be have good reason for believing to be true have told philip that fully believe in communion with other world credit history of father lawfulness of mission for be surrounded impelled worked upon by being different in nature from ourselves have have full evidence a will acknowledge when state what have occurred in own family why such malevolent being a be about to speak of must be permitted to interfere with punish may say comparatively unoffending mortal be beyond comprehension that be so permitted be most certain great principle of evil fulfils work of evil why then not other minor spirit of same class inquired philip what matter to whether be tried by have to suffer from enmity of fellow mortal whether be persecuted by being more powerful more malevolent than know that have to work out salvation that will be judged according to strength if then there be evil spirit who delight to oppress man there surely must be a amine asserts good spirit whose delight be to do service whether then have to struggle against passion only whether have to struggle not only against passion also dire influence of unseen enemy ever struggle with same odds in favour a good be stronger than evil combat in case be on 'vantage ground whether a in first fight good cause single handed a in second although opposed have host of heaven ranged on side thus be scale of divine justice evenly balanced man be still free agent a own virtuous vicious propensity must ever decide whether will gain lose victory most true replied krantz now to history father be not born originally resident in hartz mountain be serf of hungarian nobleman of great possession in transylvania although serf be not by mean poor illiterate man in fact be rich intelligence respectability be such that have be raised by lord to stewardship whoever may happen to be born serf serf must remain even though become wealthy man such be condition of father father have be married for about five year by marriage have three child eldest brother caesar hermann sister named marcella know philip that latin be still language spoken in country will account for high sounding name mother be very beautiful woman unfortunately more beautiful than virtuous be seen admired by lord of soil father be sent away upon mission during absence mother flattered by attention won by assiduity of nobleman yielded to wish so happened that father returned very unexpectedly discovered intrigue evidence of mother shame be positive surprised in company of seducer carried away by impetuosity of feeling watched opportunity of meeting taking place between murdered wife seducer conscious that a serf not even provocation have received must be allowed a justification of conduct hastily collected together what money must lay hand upon a be then in depth of winter put horse to sleigh taking child with set off in middle of night be far away before tragical circumstance have transpired aware that must be pursued that have chance of escape if remained in portion of native country in authority must lay hold of continued flight without intermission until have buried in intricacy seclusion of hartz mountain of course have now told learned afterwards oldest recollection be knit to rude yet comfortable cottage in lived with father brother sister be on confines of one of vast forest cover northern part of germany around be few acre of ground during summer month father cultivated though yielded doubtful harvest be sufficient for support in winter remained much in door for a father followed chase be left alone wolf during season incessantly prowled about father have purchased cottage land about of one of rude forester who gain livelihood partly by hunting partly by burning charcoal for purpose of smelting ore from neighbouring mine be distant about two mile from other habitation can call to mind whole landscape now tall pine rose up on mountain above wide expanse of forest beneath on topmost bough head of whose tree looked down from cottage a mountain below rapidly descended into distant valley in summer time prospect be beautiful during severe winter more desolate scene must not well be imagined said that in winter father occupied with chase day left often must lock door that might not leave cottage have one to assist to take care of indeed be not easy to find female servant who must live in such solitude must have found one father must nut have received for have imbibed horror of sex a difference of conduct towards two boy poor little sister marcella evidently proved may suppose be sadly neglected indeed suffered much for father fearful that might come to harm must not allow fuel when left cottage be obliged therefore to creep under heap of bear skin there to keep a warm a must until returned in evening when blazing fire be delight that father chose restless sort of life may appear strange fact be that must not remain quiet whether from remorse for having committed murder from misery consequent on change of situation from combined be never happy unless be in state of activity child however when left much to acquire thoughtfulness not common to age so be with during short cold day of winter must sit silent longing for happy hour when snow must melt leaf must burst out bird begin song when must again be set at liberty such be peculiar savage sort of life until brother caesar be nine seven sister five year old when circumstance occurred on be based extraordinary narrative be about to relate one evening father returned home rather later than usual have be unsuccessful a weather be very severe many foot of snow be upon ground be not only very cold in very bad humour have brought in wood be three gladly assisting other in blowing on ember to create blaze when caught poor little marcella by arm threw aside child fell struck mouth bled very much brother ran to raise up accustomed to ill usage afraid of father did not dare to cry looked up in face very piteously father drew stool nearer to hearth muttered something in abuse of woman busied with fire brother have deserted when sister be so unkindly treated cheerful blaze be soon result of exertion did not a usual crowd round marcella still bleeding retired to corner brother took seat beside while father hung over fire gloomily alone such have be position for about hour when howl of wolf close under window of cottage fell on ear father started up seized gun howl be repeated examined priming then hastily left cottage shutting door after waited anxiously listening for thought that if succeeded in shooting wolf must return in better humour although be harsh to of particularly so to little sister still loved father loved to see cheerful happy for what else have to look up to may here observe perhaps there never be three child who be fonder of other did not like other child fight dispute together if by chance disagreement did arise between elder brother little marcella must run to kissing seal through entreaty peace between marcella be lovely amiable child can recall beautiful feature even now ala poor little marcella be dead then observed philip dead yes dead how did die must not anticipate philip let tell story waited time report of gun did not reach elder brother then said father have followed wolf will not be back for time marcella let wash blood from mouth then will leave corner go to fire warm ourselves did so remained there until near midnight minute wondering a grew later why father did not return have idea that be in danger thought that must have chased wolf for very long time will look out see if be coming ' said brother caesar going to door take care ' said marcella wolf must be about now can not kill brother ' brother opened door very cautiously few inch

quantity proceeded to dress a used to do under father superintendence be busy putting into platter before fire to await coming when heard sound of horn listened there be noise outside minute afterwards father entered ushering in young female large dark man in hunter dress perhaps have better now relate what be only known to many year afterwards when father have left cottage perceived large white wolf about thirty yard from a soon a animal saw father retreated slowly growling snarling father followed animal did not run always kept at distance father did not like to fire until be pretty certain that ball must take effect thus went on for time wolf now leaving father far behind then stopping snarling defiance at then again on approach setting off at speed anxious to shoot animal for white wolf be very rare father continued pursuit for several hour during continually ascended mountain must know philip that there be peculiar spot on mountain be supposed a story will prove truly supposed to be inhabited by evil influence be well known to huntsman who invariably avoid now one of spot open space in pine forest above have be pointed out to father a dangerous on account whether disbelieved wild story whether in eager pursuit of chase disregarded know not certain however be that be decoyed by white wolf to open space when animal appeared to slacken speed father approached came close up to raised gun to shoulder be about to fire when wolf suddenly disappeared thought that snow on ground must have dazzled sight let down gun to look for beast be gone how must have escaped over clearance without seeing be beyond comprehension mortified at ill success of chase be about to retrace step when heard distant sound of horn astonishment at sound at hour in such wilderness made forget for moment disappointment remained riveted to spot in minute horn be blown second time at great distance father stood still listened third time be blown forget term used to express be signal father well knew implied that party be lost in wood in few minute more father beheld man on horseback with female seated on crupper enter cleared space ride up to at first father

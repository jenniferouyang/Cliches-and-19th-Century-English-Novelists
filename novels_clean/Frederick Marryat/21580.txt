dislike to matrimony a brother have imbibed be not in power to say mr witherington be three year younger than sister although have for time worn wig be only because considered more comfortable mr witherington whole character might be summed up in two word eccentricity benevolence eccentric certainly be a most bachelor usually be man be rough pebble without attrition received from contact with gentler sex be wonderful how lady pumice man down to smoothness occasion to roll over over with rest of specie jostling not wounding neighbour a wave of circumstance bring into collision with mr witherington roused from deep reverie felt for string connected with bell pull be butler duty invariably to attach to arm of master chair previous to last exit from dining room for a mr witherington very truly observed be very uncomfortable to be obliged to get up ring bell indeed more than once mr witherington have calculated advantage disadvantage of having daughter about eight year old who must ring bell air newspaper cut leaf of new novel when however called to mind that must not always remain at precise age decided that balance of comfort be against mr witherington having pulled bell again fell into brown study mr butler made appearance observing that master be occupied immediately stopped at door erect motionless with face a melancholy a if be performing mute at porch of departed peer of realm for be understood thing that greater rank of defunct longer must be face of course better must be pay now a mr witherington be still in profound thought mr jonathan will stand a long a hackney coach horse will just leave a be while introduce brief history of latter to reader jonathan trapp have served a footboy term believe be derived from who be in humble capacity receiving quantum suff of application of foot of above to increase energy of service then a footman implies that have be promoted to more agreeable right of administering instead of receiving above dishonourable application lastly for promotion must go higher in family have be raised to dignity of butler in service of mr witherington senior jonathan then fell in love for butler be guilty of indiscretion a well a master fair flame who be lady maid in family notwithstanding that have witnessed consequence of error in others must take warning gave warning married like most butler lady maid who pair off set up public house be justice to lady maid to say that must have preferred eating house be overruled by jonathan who argued that although people must drink when be not dry never must eat unless be hungry now although there be truth in observation be certain that business did not prosper have be surmised that jonathan tall lank lean figure injured custom a people be too much inclined to judge of goodness of ale by rubicund face rotundity of landlord therefore inferred that there must be no good beer where mine host be picture of famine there certainly be much in appearance in world appears that in consequence of jonathan cadaverous appearance very soon appeared in gazette what ruined jonathan in one profession procured immediate employment in appraiser upholsterer undertaker who be called in to value fixture fixed eye upon jonathan knowing value of peculiarly lugubrious appearance having half brother of equal height offered immediate employment a mute jonathan soon forgot to mourn own loss of few hundred in new occupation of mourning loss of thousand erect stiff statue like carriage long melancholy face a stood at portal of who have entered portal of next world be too often sarcasm upon grief of inheritor even grief be worth nothing in trafficking world unless be paid for jonathan buried many at last buried wife so far be well at last buried master undertaker be not quite so desirable although jonathan wept not yet did express mute sorrow a marwilled to long home drank to memory in pot of porter a returned from funeral perched with many others like carrion crow on top of hearse now jonathan be thrown out of employment from reason most people must have thought highest recommendation undertaker refused to take because must not match in unfortunate dilemma jonathan thought of mr witherington junior have served have buried mr witherington father lady mary mother felt that have strong claim for such variety of service applied to bachelor fortunately for jonathan mr witherington butler incumbent be just about to commit same folly a jonathan have done before jonathan be again installed resolving in own mind to lead former life have nothing more to do with lady maid from habit jonathan still carried a mute on ordinary occasion never indulging in approximation to mirth except when perceived that master be in high spirit then rather from sense of duty than from real hilarity of heart jonathan be mean scholar for station in life during service with undertaker have acquired english of latin motto be placed upon hatchments motto when considered a apt be very apt to quote left jonathan standing at door have closed handle still remained in hand jonathan said mr witherington after long pause wish to look at last letter from new york will find on dressing table jonathan quitted room without reply made reappearance with letter be long time have be expecting vessel jonathan observed mr witherington unfolding letter yes sir long while tempus fugit replied butler in low tone half shutting eye hope to god accident have happened continued mr witherington poor little cousin twin e'en now that speak may be at bottom of sea yes sir replied butler sea defrauds many honest undertaker of profit by blood of witheringtons may be left without heir will be obliged to marry must be very uncomfortable very little comfort echoed jonathan wife be dead in caelo quies well must hope for best suspense be anything comfortable observed mr witherington after looking over content of letter for at least twentieth time will do jonathan will ring for

business be courted by relation have to certain degree committed herself be to say that notwithstanding injunction of parent have fallen in love with young lieutenant in marching regiment whose pedigree be respectable whose fortune be anything respectable consisting merely of subaltern pay poor men unfortunately always make love better than who be rich because having le to care about not being puffed up with own consequence be not so selfish think much more of lady than of young lady also who fall in love never consider whether there be sufficient to make pot boil probably because young lady in love lose appetite not feeling inclined to eat at time imagine love will always supply want of food now will appeal to married lady whether be not right in asserting that although collation spread for friend on day of marriage be looked upon with almost loathing find appetite return with interest soon afterwards be precisely case with cecilia rather cecilia templemore for have

cabin information may obtain from krouman must be very important francisco made reply appeared to be reading book cain eye passed from one to other a if to read thought pray what be saying mr pompey say massa captain only tell young massa dis very fine ting ask where get massa francisco tell might be to black scoundrel cried captain seizing goblet striking man with blow on head flattened vessel at same time felled krouman powerful a be to deck blood streamed a man slowly rose stupefied trembling from violent concussion without saying word staggered out of cabin cain threw on one of locker in

before have succeeded in detaching two vessel cable length ship went down with treasure so coveted indignation rage be expressed by captain a rapidly walked deck in company with first mate violent gesticulation proved to crew that there be mischief brewing francisco did not return to cabin remained forward with kroumen who although small portion of ship company be known to be resolute not to be despised be also observed that of have supplied with arm be collected forward huddled together watching motion manoeuvre talking rapidly in own language schooner be now steered to north westward under press of sail sun again disappeared francisco returned not to cabin went below surrounded by kroumen who appeared to have devoted to protection once during night hawkhurst summoned on deck obeyed not order to expostulation of boatswain mate who came down made reply there be many of pirate in schooner who appeared to coincide with kroumen in regard for francisco there be shade of villainy in most profligate of society among pirate crew be not yet wholly debased foul murder of holy man cruel fate of beautiful teresa barbarous conduct of captain towards filippo mistress be deed of atrocity to even most hardened be unaccustomed francisco pleading in behalf of mercy be at least crime yet considered that francisco be doomed be general favourite worst disposed of pirate with exception of hawkhurst if did not love must not forbear respecting although at same time felt that if francisco remained on board power even of cain must soon be destroyed for many month hawkhurst who detested youth have be most earnest that must be sent out of schooner now pressed captain for removal in way a necessary for mutual safety pointing out to cain conduct of kroumen fear that large proportion of ship company be equally disaffected cain felt truth of hawkhurst representation went down to cabin to consider upon what must be done be past midnight when cain worn out with conflicting passion of day fell into uneasy slumber dream be of francisco mother appeared to pleading for son cain babbled in sleep at time francisco with pompey have softly crawled aft that might obtain if found captain asleep pistol of francisco with ammunition pompey slipped in first started back when heard captain voice remained at cabin door listening murmured cain must die useless plead not woman know murdered thee plead not dy in one of socket of silver lamp there be lighted wick ray of be sufficient to afford dim view of cabin francisco overhearing word of cain stepped in walked up to side of bed boy plead not continued cain lying on back breathing heavily plead not woman to morrow dy pause ensued a if sleeping man be listening to reply yes a murdered thee so will murder wretch said francisco in low solemn voice didst thou kill mother did did responded cain still sleeping why continued francisco who at acknowledgment on part of sleeping captain be careless of discovery in mood vexed answered cain fiend thou hast then confessed cried francisco in loud voice awoke captain who started up before sens be well recovered eye open so a to distinguish form pompey struck out light be darkness then put hand to francisco mouth led out of cabin who be there who be there cried cain officer in charge of deck hastened down did call sir call repeated captain thought there be one in cabin want light be continued recovering a wiped cold perspiration from forehead in meantime francisco with pompey have gained former place of refuge with kroumen feeling of young man changed from agony to revenge object in returning to cabin to recover weapon have be frustrated determination now be to take life of captain if possibly must following morning kroumen again refused to work go on deck state of affair be reported by hawkhurst to chief mate now assumed tone for have sounded not majority most steady influential men on board who like be veteran in crime must be sir will no longer command vessel be desired to say so indeed replied cain with sneer perhaps have already chosen successor hawkhurst perceived that have lost ground changed manner speak for if command vessel will not remain in if quit quit also must find cain be pacified subject be not renewed turn hand up at last said captain pirate crew assembled aft lad be sorry that law oblige to make example mutiny disaffection must be punished be equally bound a yourselves by law have laid down for guidance while sail together may believe that in doing duty in instance be guided by sense of justice wish to prove to that be worthy to command francisco have be with since be child have lived with be painful to part with be here to see that law be put in force have be guilty of repeated mutiny contempt must die death death cried several of pirate in advance death justice no more murder said several voice from behind who be that speaks too much murder yesterday more murder shouted several voice at once let men come forward who speak cried cain with withering look one obeyed order down then men bring up francisco whole of pirate crew hastened below with different intention be determined to seize francisco hand over to death others to protect confused noise be heard shout of down seize opposed to of murder murder party have snatched up arm who sided with francisco joined kroumen whilst others also hastened below to bring on deck slight scuffle ensued before separated ascertained by separation strength of contending party francisco perceiving that be joined by large body desired men to follow went up fore ladder took possession of forecastle pirate on side supplied with arm francisco stood forward in advance hawkhurst of crew who sided with have retreated to quarter deck rallied round captain who leaned against capstern be then able to estimate comparative strength number on whole preponderated in favour of francisco on captain side be older more athletic of crew may add more determined still captain hawkhurst perceived danger of situation be thought advisable to parley for present wreak vengeance hereafter for few minute there be low consultation between party at last cain advanced lad said addressing who have rallied round francisco little thought that fire brand must have be cast in vessel to set at variance be duty a captain to propose that law must be enforced tell now what be that wish be only here a captain to take sense of whole crew have animosity against lad have loved have cherished like viper have stung in return instead of being in arm against other ought not to be united have therefore one proposal to make to be let sentence go by vote ballot if please whatever sentence may be will be guided by can say more lad replied francisco when captain have done speaking think better that must accept proposal rather than blood must be shed life be of little consequence say then will agree to vote submit to law a captain say have be laid down to regulate discipline of vessel pirate on francisco side looked round among party perceiving that be most numerous consented to proposal hawkhurst stepped forward observed of course kroumen can have vote a belong to vessel objection be important a amounted to twenty five after number be deducted in probability francisco adherent must have be in minority pirate with francisco objected again assumed attitude of defence one moment said francisco stepping in advance before point be settled wish to take sense of of a to of law ask hawkhurst who be now opposed to whether have not one law be blood for blood yes yes shouted pirate then let captain stand forward answer to charge if dare cain curled lip in derision walked within two yard of francisco well boy be here what be charge first ask captain cain who be so anxious that law must be enforced whether acknowledge blood for blood ' be just law most just when shed party who revenge be not amenable 't be well then villain that thou art answer didst thou not murder mother cain at accusation started answer truth lie like recreant repeated francisco did not murder mother captain lip muscle of face quivered did not reply blood for blood cried francisco a fired pistol at cain who staggered fell on deck hawkhurst several of pirate hastened to captain raised must have told last night said cain speaking with difficulty a blood flowed from wound told so said francisco turning round to who stood by cain be taken down into cabin on examination wound be not mortal although loss of blood have be rapid very great in few minute hawkhurst joined party on quarter deck found that tide have turned more in francisco favour than have expected law of blood for blood be held most sacred indeed be knowledge that be solemnly recognised that if one pirate wounded other be at liberty to take life without punishment prevented constant affray between party whose knife must otherwise have be answer to affront be more debased law of duelling kept such profligate associate on good term finding therefore that feeling predominated even among who be opposed to francisco on other question hawkhurst thought advisable to parley hawkhurst said francisco have one request to make if complied with will put end to contention be that will put on shore at first land that make if party engage to do will desire who support to return to obedience grant replied hawkhurst so will others will not men agreed agreed upon side cried pirate throwing away weapon mingling with other a if have never be opposed there be old saying that there be honour amongst thief so often prof man in vessel knew that agreement must be strictly adhered to francisco now walked deck with a much composure a if nothing have occurred hawkhurst who be aware that must fulfil promise carefully examined chart when went down below came up altered course of schooner two point more to northward next morning be up at mast head nearly hour when descended again altered course by nine o'clock low sandy island appeared on lee bow when within mile of ordered schooner to be hove to lowered down small boat from stern then turned hand up lad must keep promise to put francisco on

into francisco hand fishing line with hook thank pompey have forgot that book in cabin know mean pompey nodded head went below be time before returned during hawkhurst became impatient be very small boat have be lowered down have lug sail two pair of scull in be quite full when francisco chest other article have be put in come have time to wait said hawkhurst in boat francisco shook hand with many of crew wished of farewell indeed now that beheld poor lad about to be cast on desolate island even most opposed to felt emotion of pity although acknowledged that absence be necessary yet knew determined courage with quality be always strong appeal who will row lad ashore bring boat off not replied one must haunt ever afterwards so appeared to think for one volunteered francisco jumped into boat there be room for one will row on shore cried farewell lad farewell stop not so must not have boat may escape from island cried hawkhurst why must poor fellow replied men let have boat yes yes

hawkhurst give book mr hawkhurst replied malignant rascal tossing bible over taffrail will not have have heard say that there be consolation in for afflicted francisco shoved off boat seizing scull pushed astern picked up book still floated laid to dry on after thwart of boat then pulled in for shore in meantime schooner have let draw fore sheet have already left quarter of mile astern before francisco have gained sand bank be hull down to northward chapter ten sand bank first half hour that francisco be on desolate spot watched receding schooner thought be unconnected vague wandering through various scene have passed on deck of vessel recalling to memory different character of on board of much a have longed to quit disgusted a have be with with whom have be forced to associate still a sail grew fainter fainter to view a increased distance more than once felt that even remaining on board of must have be preferable to present deserted lot exclaimed after little further reflection have rather perish here than continue to witness scene have be forced to behold once more fixed eye upon white sail then sat down on loose sand remained in deep melancholy reverie until scorching heat reminded of situation afterwards rose turned thought upon present situation to what must be measure most advisable to take hauled little boat still farther on beach attached painter to one of oar fixed deep in sand then proceeded to survey bank found that small portion be uncovered at high water for trifling a be rise of tide bank be so low that water flowed almost over most elevated part be not more than fifteen foot above high water mark be small knoll of about fifty foot in circumference to part resolved to remove effect returned to boat having lifted out chest water provision with other article have obtained dragged up one by one until be collected at spot have chosen then took out of boat oar little sail fortunately have remained in last object to haul little boat up to same spot be one demanded exertion after considerable fatigue contrived by first lifting round bow then stern to effect object tired exhausted then repaired to one of breaker of water refreshed heat a day advanced have become intolerable stimulated to fresh exertion turned over boat contrived that bow stern must rest upon two little hillock so a to raise above level of sand beneath two three foot spread out sail from keel above with thole pin a peg so a to keep off ray of sun dragging breaker of water provision underneath boat left chest outside having thus formed for sort of covering must protect from heat of day damp of night crept in to shelter until evening although francisco have not be on deck knew pretty well whereabouts then be taking out chart from chest examined coast to ascertain probable distance might be from prospect of succour calculated that be on one of patch of sand bank off coast of loango about seven hundred mile from isle of st thomas nearest place where might expect to fall in with european face from coast felt certain that must not be more than forty fifty mile at most must trust among savage native who inhabited knew how ill have be treated by european for at period be quite a common for slave trader to land take away inhabitant a slave by force a to purchase in more northern territory still might be fortunate enough to fall in with trader on coast a there be few who still carried on barter for gold dust ivory know can not conceive situation much more deplorable than one have just described to have be that of francisco alone without chance of assistance with only sufficiency of food for few day cut off from rest of fellow creature with only so much terra firma a must prevent being swallowed up by vast unfathomable ocean into horizon fell on side around chance of escape how small hundred of mile from from whom might expect assistance only mean of reaching small boat mere cockleshell first rough gale must inevitably destroy such indeed be first thought of francisco soon recovered from despondency be young courageous buoyant with hope there be feeling of pride of trust in own resource exertion increase stimulates in proportion to danger difficulty be daring of soul proving celestial origin eternal duration so intense be heat francisco almost panted for sufficient air to support life a lay under shade of boat during whole of day not breath of wind disturbed glassy wave nature appeared hushed into one horrible calm be not until shade of night be covering solitude francisco ventured forth from retreat found little relief there be unnatural closeness in air suffocation unusual even in clime francisco cast eye up to vault of heaven be astonished to find that there be star visible grey mist covered whole firmament directed view downwards to horizon that too be not to be defined there be dark bank around walked to edge of sand bank there be not even ripple wide ocean appeared to be in trance in state of lethargy stupor parted hair from feverish brow once more surveying horrible lifeless stagnant waste soul sickened cast upon sand there lay for many hour in state bordering upon wild despair at last recovered rising to knee prayed for strength submission to will of heaven when be once more upon foot have again scanned ocean perceived that there be change rapidly approaching dark bank on horizon have now risen higher up opaqueness be everywhere more dense low murmur be heard a if there be wind stirring aloft although sea be still glassy a lake sign of movement about to take place be evident solitary youth watched watched now sound increased here there wild thread of air whence coming who must tell a rapidly disappearing must ruffle for second portion of stagnant sea then came whizzing sound moan then rumbling noise of distant thunder loud louder yet still louder broad black line be seen sweeping along expanse of water fearful in rapidity come hurricane burst at once with force terrific sound upon isolated francisco first blast be so powerful so unexpected that threw down prudence dictated to to remain in position for loose sand be swept off whirled in such force a to blind prevent seeing foot from must have crawled to boat for security knew not in direction to proceed did not last for now water be borne up upon strong wing of hurricane sand be rendered firm by saturation with element francisco felt that be drenched raised head must discover be that firmament be mantled with darkness horrible from intensity that sea be in one extended foam boiling everywhere white a milk still a if power of wind have compelled to be so water have encroached one half sand bank be covered with while over other foam whirled portion chasing other with wild rapidity now window of heaven be opened rain mingled with spray caught up by hurricane be dashed hurled upon forlorn youth who still lay where have be first thrown down of sudden wash of water told that must remain there no longer sea be rising rising fast before must gain few pace on hand knee wave a if chased in wrath repeated warning of extreme danger be obliged to rise on foot hasten to high part of sand bank where have drawn up boat provision blinded a be by rain spray must distinguish nothing of sudden fell violently have stumbled over one of breaker of water head struck against sea chest where then be boat be gone must have be swept away by fury of wind ala then chance be over if not washed away by angry water have to prolong existence few day then to die effect of blow have received on forehead with shock of mind occasioned by disappearance of boat overpowered remained for time in state of insensibility when francisco recovered scene be again changed wide expanse be now in state of wild fearful commotion water roared a loud a did hurricane whole sand bank with exception of part on stood be now covered with tumultuous foam place of refuge be occasionally invaded when vast mass o'erlording other wave expended fury even to foot francisco prepared to die gradually darkness of heaven disappeared there be longer bank upon horizon francisco hoped ala hoped what that might be saved from present impending death to be reserved for one still more horrible to be saved from fury of wave must swallow up in few second remove from pain suffering to perish for want of sustenance under burning sun to be withered to be parched to death calling in agony for water a francisco thought of covered face with hand prayed oh god thy will be done in thy mercy raise still higher raise water water did not rise higher howling of wind gradually decreased foaming sea have obeyed divine injunction have gone so far farther day dawned sky cleared first red tint announcing return of light heat have appeared on broken horizon when eye of despairing youth be directed to black mass on tumultuous water be vessel with one mast standing rolling heavily running before gale right on for sand bank where stood hull one moment borne aloft next disappearing from view in hollow of agitated water will be dashed to piece thought francisco will be lost can not see bank must have made signal to if have be able to warn of danger forgetting at time own desolate situation a francisco watched sun rose bright joyous over scene of anxiety pain on came vessel flying before gale while sea chased a if must fain overwhelm be fearful to see scud agonising to know that be rushing to destruction at last must distinguish on board waved hand perceived not shouted voice be borne away by gale on came vessel a if doomed be within two cable length of bank when on board perceived danger be too late have rounded to wave hurled towards sand struck only remaining mast fell over side roaring wave hastened to complete work of destruction of death chapter eleven escape francisco eye be fixed upon vessel over sea now broke with terrific violence there appeared to be about eight nine men on deck who sheltered under weather bulwark wave a broke against side then dashed in foam over threw with convulsive jerk still further on sand bank at last be so high up fury be partly spent before dashed against frame have vessel be strong well built have be collier coasting english shore there be fair chance that might have withstood fury of storm until have subsided that by remaining on board crew might have survived be of very different mould a francisco justly surmised american brig built for swift sailing very sharp moreover very slightly put together francisco eye a may easily be supposed be never removed from only object must now interest unexpected appearance imminent danger of fellow creature at desolate spot perceived that two of men went to hatch slid over to leeward then descended although sea broke over vessel large quantity of water must have poured into hatch be not put on again by who remained on deck in few minute mystery be solved one after at first then by dozen poured forth out of hold kidnapped african who composed cargo in short time deck be covered with poor creature have be released by humanity of two english sailor that might have same chance with of saving life still attempt be made to quit vessel huddled together like flock of sheep with wild wave breaking over there remained european african a heavy blow of sea upon side of vessel careened shook be seen to cling in direction with distinction between captured oppressor scene be soon changed frame of vessel must no longer withstand violence of wave a francisco watched of sudden be seen to divide midships portion to turn over then be struggle for life hundred be floating on raging element wrestling for existence white foam of ocean be dotted by black head of negro who attempted to gain bank be awful terrible scene to witness so many at one moment tossed dashed about by wave so many fellow being threatened with eternity at one moment be close to beach forced on to by tremendous wave at next receding water undertow swept back of many who have be swimming one half have disappeared to rise more francisco watched with agony a perceived that number decreased that none have yet gained shore at last snatched up haulyards of boat sail be near hastened down to spot to afford such succour a might be possible be effort in vain a sea washed apparently inanimate body on shore must then have again swept away to return in mockery caught hold of dragged safe on bank thus did continue exertion until fifteen of body of negro be spread upon beach although exhausted senseless be not dead long before have dragged up last of number many of previously saved have without other assistance than heat of sun recovered from insensibility francisco must have continued task of humanity parted vessel have now be riven into fragment by force of wave whole beach be strewed with timber store be dashed on shore by water then swept back again by return in short time severe blow received from fragment disabled from further exertion sank exhausted on sand indeed further attempt be useless on board vessel have be launched into sea at same moment who be not now on shore be past succour francisco walked up to who have be saved found twelve of be recovered sitting on ham rest be still in state of insensibility then went up to knoll where chest provision have be placed throwing down by surveyed scene wind have lulled sun shone brightly sea be much le violent wave have subsided longer hurried on by force of hurricane broke majestically solemnly not with wildness force few hour before have displayed whole of beach be strewed with fragment of vessel with spar water cask at moment be to be observed corpse of negro turning round round in froth of wave then disappearing for hour did watch reflect then walked again to where men who have be rescued be sitting not more than thirty yard from be sickly emaciated form belonging to tribe who inhabited coast who having be accustomed from infancy to be day in water have supported better than other slave who have be procured from interior european crew of vessel of whom have perished african appeared to recover fast by heat of sun so oppressive to francisco be now exchanging few word with other whole of have revived who be most in need of aid be neglected by others francisco made sign to understood not returned to knoll pouring out water into tin pan from breaker brought down to offered to one who seized eagerly water be luxury seldom obtained in hold of slave vessel man drank deeply must have drained cup francisco prevented held to lip of be obliged to refill three time before have be supplied then brought handful of biscuit left for reflected that without precaution whole sustenance must be seized by devoured buried

thrown up high dry still rolling turning to rippling wave be scene of desolation of death negro who have be saved be huddled up together apparently in deep sleep francisco quitted elevated position walked down to low beach to survey mean disaster of others afforded for own escape to great joy found not only plenty of cask many of full of fresh water provision also in sufficiency indeed everything must be required to form raft a well a mean of support for considerable time for negro who have survived then walked up to called to answered not even moved pushed in vain heart beat quick for be fearful that be dead from previous exhaustion applied foot to one of be not until have used force in other case must have dispensed with negro awoke from state of lethargy looked vacantly about francisco have little knowledge of language of kroumen addressed negro in tongue to great joy be answered in language if not same have so great affinity to that communication became easy with assistance of negro who used still le ceremony with comrade remainder of be awakened palaver ensued francisco soon made understand that be to make raft go back to own country explaining to that if remained there water provision must soon be exhausted must perish poor creature hardly knew whether to consider supernatural being not talked among remarked at having brought fresh water day before knew that did not belong to vessel in have be wrecked be puzzled might be speculation have one good effect be that looked upon youth a superior friend most willingly obeyed led up to knoll desiring to scrape away sand supplied again with fresh water biscuit perhaps very supply way in be given to excited astonishment a much a anything francisco ate with selecting from sea chest few tool in possession desired to follow cask be collected rolled up empty one arranged for raft spar be hauled up cleared of rigging be carefully separated for lashing one two sail have be found rolled up on spar be spread out to dry provision article of clothing might be useful laid together on one side negro worked willingly showed much intelligence before evening closed everything might be available be secured wave now only tossed about lifeless form small fragment of timber must not be serviceable must occupy too much time be to detail proceeding of francisco negro for space of four day during laboured hard necessity be truly mother of invention many be ingenious resource of party before must succeed in forming raft large enough to carry provision with mast sail well secured at length be accomplished on fifth day francisco men embarked having pushed clear of bank with pole be at last able to hoist sail to fine breeze steer for coast before wind at rate of about three mile hour be not until have gained mile from bank that be no longer annoyed by dreadful smell arising from putrefaction of so many body for to bury must have be work of too great time last two day of remaining on island effluvium have become so powerful a to be source of greatest horror disgust even to negro before night when raft be about eight league from sand bank fell calm continued so for next day when breeze sprang up from south east to trimmed sail with head to northward wind course steered sent off from land there be help for francisco felt grateful that have ample supply of provision water a to enable to yield to few day contrary wind without danger of want breeze continued steady fresh be now crossing bight of benin weather be fine sea smooth flying fish rose in shoal dropped down into raft still forced way through water to northward thus did francisco negro crew remain for fortnight floating on wide ocean without object meeting view day after day be same dreary sky water by reckoning of francisco must not be far from land when on fifteenth day perceived two sail to northward francisco heart bounded with joy gratitude to heaven have telescope to examine steered directly for about dark made out to be ship schooner hove to a francisco scanned surmising what might be sun set behind two vessel after have sunk below horizon form be for few minute delineated with remarkable precision clearness there must be mistake francisco felt convinced that schooner be avenger first impulse be to run to sweep with be steered put head of raft again to northward moment reflection determined to act otherwise lowered down sail that might escape observation watched motion of vessel during few minute of light remained that ship have be captured that capture have be attended with usual scene of outrage violence have doubt be now about four mile from just a be vanishing from straining eye perceived that schooner have made sail to westward francisco feeling that be then secure from being picked up by again hoisted sail with hope of reaching ship if not scuttled intended to remove on board of then make sail for first port on coast hardly have raft regained way when horizon be lighted up perceived that pirate have set fire to vessel then be useless to proceed towards francisco again thought of putting head of raft to northward when idea struck knowing character cruelty of pirate that there might be unfortunate people left on board to perish in flame therefore continued course watching burning vessel flame increased in violence mounting up to mast catching sail one after wind blew fresh vessel be kept before wind circumstance assured francisco that there be people on board at first appeared to leave raft a sail one after be consumed by element so did decrease speed francisco in about hour be close to under counter ship be now one mass of fire from bow to mainmast volume of flame poured from main hold rising higher than lower mast ending in huge mass of smoke carried by wind ahead of quarter deck be still free from fire heat on be so intense that on board be collected at taffrail there remained violent others in mute despair for avenger people in barbarity have cut away destroyed boat to prevent escape from light thrown round vessel on board have perceived approach of francisco to rescue immediately that be under counter sail lowered almost of have descended by rope stern ladder gained place in in few minute without scarcely exchange of word be out of brig francisco pushed off just a flame burst from cabin window darting out in horizontal line like tongue of fiery serpent raft now encumbered with twelve more person be then steered to northward a soon a who have be saved have be supplied with water so much needed francisco obtained intelligence desired ship be from carthagena south america have sailed from thence to lisbon with don cumanos who have large property up magdalen river have wished to visit part of family at lisbon from thence have sailed to canary isle where also have property in way from lisbon to south america have be beaten by stress of weather to southward afterwards have be chased by avenger being very fast sailer have run down several degree before have be captured when pirate took possession found that have little cargo of value to for hold be chiefly filled with furniture other article for use of don cumanos angry at disappointment have first destroyed boat then set fire to vessel taking care not to leave until chance of fire being put out be hopeless thus have miscreant left innocent unfortunate people to perish francisco narrative of don cumanos then informed in what manner have left schooner subsequent adventure francisco be now very anxious to make land obtain succour from vessel many who be now on board time that have already be at sea obliged to reduce allowance of water fortune favoured after trial on third day vessel hove in sight be seen by made sail for took on board be schooner trafficking on coast for gold dust ivory magnificent offer of don cumanos induced to give up voyage run across atlantic to carthagena to francisco be of little moment where went in don cumanos have found sincere friend have be preserver said spaniard allow to return obligation come live with a francisco be equally pleased with don cumanos accepted offer arrived safely at

a most admiral tender usually be sometimes carrying tender made for supply of provision tender of service if required from admiral if not particularly wanted with important charge of tender billet doux to fair friend be tender subject to touch upon in meantime must be understood that have same commission to sink burn destroy a other of majesty vessel if anything came in way a usually carried despatch real importance of be of course unknown be not to go out of way upon such service edward templemore did however occasionally go little out of way have lately captured very fine privateer after smart action for anticipated promotion admiral thought too young therefore gave next vacancy to own nephew who admiral quite forgot be much younger edward laughed when heard of upon arrival at port royal admiral who expected that must make appearance pouting with disappointment when came up to penn to report be so pleased with good humour that made vow templemore must have next vacancy also quite forgot because edward happened to be at time occurred on long cruise out of sight out of mind be proverb so well established that may be urged a excuse for person who have so many other thing to think of a admiral entrusted with command of west india station lieutenant templemore have in consequence commanded enterprise for nearly two year without grumbling for be of happy disposition passed very happy sort of life mr witherington be very indulgent to allowed to draw liberally have plenty of money for for friend who required have plenty of amusement amongst other diversion have fallen

monk who be depository of sin of governor establishment be with daughter edward templemore fell into heresy of love be indeed very beautiful like countrywoman be ardent in affection few day that be on

a secrecy add charm to amour clara received long letter telescope from edward letter informed that whenever must must make appearance in schooner off south of island await signal made by at certain

vast strip of rich meadow covered with numerous herd of cattle house be not hundred yard from bank of magnificent stream small deep creek ran up to adjacent building for don cumanos have property even more valuable being proprietor of gold mine near town of jambrano about eight mile farther up mine have latterly become exceedingly productive ore be brought down river in boat smelted in outhouse near creek to have just referred will be necessary to observe that establishment of noble spaniard be numerous consisting of nearly one hundred person employed in smelting house attached to household for time francisco remained here happy contented have become confidential supervisor of don cumanos household proved worthy of trust so important be considered a one of family one morning a francisco be proceeding down to smelting house to open hatch of small deck boat have arrived from jambrano with ore be invariably secured with padlock by superintendent above to don cumanos have corresponding key one of chief men informed that vessel have anchored off mouth of river day before weighed again early that morning that be now standing off on from carthagena probably beating up replied francisco valga dios if know that sir said diego must have thought nothing about giacomo pedro who went out to fish last night a usual instead of coming back before midnight have not be heard of since indeed be strange did ever stay so long before never sir have fished together now for seven year francisco gave key to man who opened lock of hatch returned there be cried man head sail making appearance a vessel opened to view from projecting point distant about four mile francisco directed eye towards without further remark hastened to house well francisco said don cumanos who be stirring small cup of chocolate what be news morning nostra senora del carmen aguilla have arrived have just unlocked hatch there be vessel off point requires examination have come for telescope requires examination why francisco because giacomo pedro who went fishing last night have not returned there be tidings of be strange how be connected with vessel will explain a soon a have have examination of replied francisco who have taken up telescope be drawing out tube francisco fixed glass against sill of window examined vessel time in silence yes by living god be avenger other exclaimed a removed telescope from eye eh cried don cumanos be pirate vessel avenger will forfeit life upon don cumanos must be prepared know that have long talked of visit to quarter anticipate great booty have on board who know coast well disappearance of two men convinces that sent up boat last night to reconnoitre have captured torture will extract information pirate require have little doubt that attack will be made when learn how much bullion there be at present on premise may be right replied don cumanos thoughtfully be provided be sure that be pirate vessel sure don cumanos know timber plank in there be not rope block can recognise at distance of four mile with glass a can discover little variety in rigging from other craft will swear to repeated francisco once more looking through telescope if attack francisco must defend trust beat off will come in boat at night if be to run in schooner by daylight anchor abreast of must have poor chance little think that be here that be recognised will attack night rather think what do then propose francisco that must send female away to don teodoro be five mile call men together a soon a possible be strong enough to beat off if barricade house can not land more than from ninety to one hundred men a must remain in charge of schooner can muster quite a many may be a well to promise men reward if do duty be right enough bullion have here here have better let remain will take too much time to remove besides will weaken force by men who must be in charge of out house must be abandoned everything be of consequence taken from fire will in probability at event have plenty of time before if begin at once well francisco will make commandant leave arrangement to while go speak to donna isidora send for men speak to promise reward act a if be ordering upon own responsibility trust will prove worthy of confidence sir replied francisco carambo exclaimed old don a left room be fortunate be here might have be murdered in bed francisco sent for head men of establishment told what be convinced must have to expect then explained to view rest be summoned francisco pointed out to little mercy must receive if pirate be not repulsed reward be promised by don cumanos if did duty spaniard be individually brave encouraged by francisco agreed that must defend property to last house of don cumanos be well suited to resist attack of description in musketry only be expected to be employed be long parallelogram of stone wall with wooden veranda on first floor for be only one story high window on first story be more numerous at basement there be two other opening door in whole line of building be of composite architecture between morisco spanish if lower part of house be of stone must be secured from entrance assailant must of course fight under great disadvantage window below be first secured by piling heavy mass of stone in interior of room against rising to ceiling from base like segment of pyramid extending to opposite side of chamber preparation be made for effectually barricading door before night ladder be then fixed to ascend to veranda be rendered musket proof nearly a high a railing to protect men donna isidora woman of establishment be in afternoon despatched to don teodoro at request of francisco joined to entreaty of donna isidora don cumanos be persuaded to accompany don called men telling that left francisco in command expected to do duty then shaking hand with cavalcade be soon lost in wood behind narrow meadow skirted river there be want of musket ammunition be employed casting bullet others in examining arm have long be laid by before evening be ready man have received arm ammunition flint have be inspected francisco have time to pay more attention to schooner have during day increased distance from land be now again standing in for shore hour before dusk when within three mile wore round put head to offing will attack night said francisco feel almost positive yard stay tackle be up ready for hoisting out long boat let come senor will give warm reception replied diego second in authority be soon too dark to perceive vessel francisco diego ordered man five into house door be firmly barricaded large piece of rock have be rolled into passage piled against francisco then posted five men down bank of river at hundred yard distance from other to give notice of approach of boat be about ten o'clock at night when francisco diego descended ladder went to examine outpost senor said diego a francisco stood on bank of river at what hour be idea that villain will make attempt be difficult to say if same captain command who did when be on board of will not be until after moon be down will not be till midnight must be other who be in authority may not be so prudent holy virgin senor be ever on board of vessel yes diego be for long while too not with own good will have not be on board never must have recognised very true senor then may thank saint that have once be pirate hope that never be that diego replied francisco smiling have be witness to dreadful proceeding on board of vessel at remembrance of even now blood curdles to pas away time francisco then detailed many scene of horror to diego have witnessed when on board of avenger be still in middle of narrative when musket be discharged by farthermost sentinel hark diego nearer nearer to gave signal that boat be close at hand in few minute men came in announcing that pirate be pulling up stream in three boat be le than quarter of mile from landing place diego go to house with men see that be ready said francisco will wait here little longer fire till come to diego men departed francisco be left on beach alone in minute sound of oar be plainly distinguishable francisco ear be directed to catch if possible voice yes thought come with intention of murder robbery will through be disappointed a boat approached heard voice of signal musket fired have told pirate that be discovered that in probability must meet with resistance silence be therefore no longer of advantage oar lad oar cried hawkhurst one boat ceased rowing soon afterwards two others whole of be now plainly seen by francisco at distance of about one cable length from where stood clear still night carried sound of voice along water here be creek sir said hawkhurst leading up to building must not be better to land there a if be not occupied will prove protection to if have hard fight for very true hawkhurst replied voice francisco immediately recognised to be that of cain be alive then thought francisco blood be not yet upon hand give way lad cried boat dashed up creek francisco hastened back to house now lad said a sprang up ladder must be resolute have to deal with desperate men have heard voice of captain chief mate so there be doubt a to being pirate boat be up creek will land behind out building haul up ladder lay fore aft on veranda fire without taking good aim silence men silence here come pirate be now seen advancing from out building in strong force in direction in came be only from side of veranda at not more than eight ten men must be placed that enemy must be repulsed francisco therefore gave order that a soon a of men have fired must retreat load musket to make room for others when pirate have advanced halfway to house on clear space between outbuilding francisco gave word to fire volley be answered by shout from pirate who with hawkhurst cain at head now pressed on not until have received second discharge from spaniard pirate have fired in return a spaniard must not at first fire volley of more than dozen musket at time opponent imagined force to be much le than really be now made other arrangement spread in semicircle in front of veranda kept up continued galling fire be returned by party under francisco for nearly quarter of hour a musket be now called into action pirate found out that have more formidable enemy to cope with than have anticipated be now quite dark not figure be to be distinguished except by momentary flashing of fire arm cain hawkhurst leaving men to continue attack have gained house position under veranda examining window door there appeared little chance of forcing entrance immediately occurred to under veranda men must not be exposed that might fire through wooden floor of upon above hawkhurst hastened away returned with about men leaving others to continue attack a before advantage of manoeuvre be soon evident musket ball of pirate pierced plank wounded many of spaniard severely francisco be at last obliged to order men to retreat into house fire out of window even warfare did not continue for supporting pillar of veranda being of wood very dry be set fire to by pirate gradually flame wound round forked tongue licked balustrade at last whole of veranda be in flame be great advantage to attacking party who must now distinguish spaniard without being so clearly seen many be killed wounded smoke heat became so intense in upper story that men must no longer remain there by advice of francisco retreated to basement of house what will do now senor said diego with grave face do replied francisco have burnt veranda be house will not take fire be of solid stone roof indeed may still here be see that be more advanced than be before a soon a veranda have burnt down must return above commence firing again from window hark sir be trying door may try long while must have tried door while veranda protected from sight a soon a be burnt will be able to drive away from will go up again see how thing be senor be of use why expose now that flame be so bright must go see if be case diego put wounded men in north chamber will be safest more out of way francisco ascended stone staircase gained upper story room be filled with smoke must distinguish nothing occasional bullet whistled past walked towards window sheltered behind wall between flame be not so violent heat more bearable in short time crash then told that veranda have fallen in looked through window mass of lighted ember have fallen down in front of house have for time driven away assailant nothing be left of veranda burning end of joist fixed in wall above window still glowing remains of post once supported smoke from below now cleared away discharge of one two musket told francisco that be perceived by enemy roof be safe thought a withdrew from window now know whether loss of veranda may not prove gain to be intention of pirate be difficult to ascertain for time have left off firing francisco returned to comrade smoke have gradually cleared away be able to resume position above a pirate did not fire of course must hing a be only by flashing of musket that enemy be to be distinguished further attempt be made at door window below francisco in vain puzzled a to intended plan of assailant nearly hour of suspense passed away of spaniard be of opinion that have retreated to boat gone away francisco knew better must do be to remain above occasionally look out to discover motion diego one two more remained with other men be kept below might be out of danger holy francis have be dreadful night senor how many hour until daylight said diego two hour at least must think replied francisco affair will be decided before that saint protect see senor be not coming francisco looked through gloom in direction of outbuilding perceived group of men advancing few moment must clearly make out yes truly diego have made ladder be carrying intend to storm window call up now must fight hard indeed spaniard hastened up filled room above have three window in front looking towards river have be sheltered by veranda will fire now senor fire till muzzle be at heart can not mount more than two at time at window recollect lad that must now fight hard for life will not be spared will show quarter mercy end of rude ladder now made appearance above sill of window have be hastily yet firmly constructed be nearly a wide a window loud cheer be followed by simultaneous mounting of ladder francisco be at centre window when hawkhurst made appearance sabre in hand struck aside musket aimed at ball whizzed harmless over broad water of river step must have be in when francisco fired pistol ball entered left shoulder of hawkhurst dropped hold before must regain spaniard charged at with musket threw back fell bearing down with one two of comrade who have be following up ladder francisco felt a if attack at window be of little consequence after fall of hawkhurst whose voice have recognised hastened to one on left a have heard cain encouraging men in direction be not wrong in conjecture cain be at window attempting to force entrance be opposed by diego other resolute men belt of pirate captain be full of pistol have already fired three with effect diego two best men be wounded others who opposed be alarmed at giant proportion francisco rushed to attack what be force of so young man against herculean power of cain still francisco left hand be at throat of pirate pistol be pointed in right when flash of pistol fired by one who followed cain threw momentary vivid light upon feature of francisco a cried out blood for blood be enough pirate captain uttered yell of terror at supposed supernatural appearance fell from ladder in fit among still burning ember of veranda fall of two chief determined resistance of spaniard checked impetuosity of assailant hesitated at last retreated bearing away with wounded spaniard cheered led by francisco followed down ladder in turn became assailant still pirate retreat be orderly fired retired rank behind rank successively kept spaniard at bay until have arrived at boat when charge be made severe conflict ensued pirate have lost too many men without commander felt dispirited hawkhurst be still on leg giving order a coolly a ever espied francisco rushing at while two party be opposed muzzle to muzzle seized by collar dragged in amongst pirate secure at event cried hawkhurst a slowly retreated gained out house francisco be overpowered hauled into one of boat of in few minute afterwards be pulling with might to escape from musket of spaniard who followed pirate by bank of river annoying in retreat chapter fourteen meeting pirate returned to vessel discomfited on board who be prepared to hoist in ingot of precious metal have to receive nought wounded men many of comrade have remained dead on shore captain be melancholy downcast hawkhurst be badly wounded obliged to be carried below a soon a came on board only capture have made be former associate francisco who by last word spoken by hawkhurst a be supported to cabin be ordered to be put in iron boat be hoisted in without noise general gloom prevailed sail be then made upon schooner when day dawned be seen by spaniard far away to northward report be soon spread through schooner that francisco have be cause of defeat be only surmise still a considered that have not recognised vessel spaniard must not have be prepared have good ground for what have swelled into assertion became therefore to many of object of bitter enmity looked forward with pleasure to destruction present confinement considered precursor of hist massa francisco said low voice near to where francisco sat on chest francisco turned round beheld krouman old friend ah pompey be still on board said francisco replied man shaking head die get away only four kroumen left massa francisco how come back again everybody tink dead say not dead ab charm with ab book if be charm have still replied francisco taking bible out of vest for strange to say francisco have kind of superstition relative to bible have put into bosom previous to attack made by pirate dat very good massa francisco den quite safe here come johnson very bad man go away in meantime cain have retired to cabin with feeling scarcely to be analysed be in bewilderment notwithstanding wound have received by hand of francisco must never have sanctioned hawkhurst putting on shore on spot promised nothing lingering miserable death irritated a have be by young man open defiance loved loved much more than be aware of when have recovered sufficiently from wound have be informed where francisco have be sent on shore quarrelled with hawkhurst reproached bitterly sternly in language hawkhurst never forgot forgave vision of starving lad haunted cain rendered miserable affection for now that be a supposed lost for ever increased with tenfold force since period cain have never be seen to smile became more gloomy more ferocious than ever men trembled when appeared on deck apparition of francisco after so long interval in such unexpected quarter of globe acted a have before described upon cain when be taken to boat be still confused in idea be not until be nearly on board that perceived that young man be indeed at side must have fallen on neck kissed for francisco have become to capture more prized than wealth of indie one pure good feeling be unextinguished in bosom of cain stained with crime with hand so deeply imbrued in blood at enmity with rest of world one feeling burnt bright clear be not to be quenched might have proved beacon light to steer back to repentance to good work there be other feeling also crowded upon mind of pirate captain knew francisco firmness decision by inscrutable mean cain considered a supernatural francisco have obtained knowledge have accused of mother death must not affection felt for young man be met with hatred defiance be too sure that must then gloomy cruel disposition must reassume influence thought of revenging attack upon life astonishment at reappearance of francisco be equally great trembled at sight of a if be accusing condemning spirit thus did wander from one fearful fancy to until at last summoned up resolution to send for morose dark man whom francisco have not seen when be before in schooner obeyed command of captain iron be unlocked francisco be brought down into cabin captain rose shut door little thought to see here francisco said cain probably not replied francisco boldly have again in power may now wreak vengeance feel none

enterprise be kept away increased speed neared avenger more than quarter of mile be nearing observed francisco must keep away point away went avenger must have recovered distance enterprise be again steered more off wind thus did continue altering course until studding sail below aloft be set by position of schooner be changed enterprise now being on starboard instead of larboard quarter of avenger relative distance between two schooner be however nearly same be about three mile half from other there be prospect of long weary chase on part of enterprise who again kept away point to near avenger vessel be now running to eastward be about hour before dark that sail hove in sight right head of avenger be clearly made out to be frigate pirate be alarmed at unfortunate circumstance a there be little doubt that must prove british cruiser if not have equally reason to expect that must assist in capture have evidently perceived two schooner have made sail tacking quarter of hour so a

below to cabin second mate be then appointed a first choice of man to fill up vacancy be left to pirate crew for three day after scene be quiet orderly on board of pirate cain now that have more fully made up mind how to act imparted to francisco plan giving up to men share of booty still on board be to francisco earnest of good intention cordiality even kind of feeling never existed before be created between of francisco mother former event of own life pirate never spoke francisco more than once put question on subject answer be will know of day francisco not yet must hate too much avenger be now clear of english isle with light wind running down shore of porto rico in evening of day on have made land schooner be becalmed about three mile from shore new first mate proposed that must land in boat obtain further supply of water from fall have discovered with glass a be necessary cain gave consent boat quitted vessel full of breaker now happened that avenger lay becalmed abreast of country seat of don d'alfarez governor of island clara have seen schooner a usual have thrown out white curtain a signal of recognition for there be perceptible difference even to sailor at distance between avenger enterprise have hastened down to beach hurried into cave awaiting arrival of edward templemore pirate boat landed at very spot of rendezvous mate leaped out of boat clara flew to receive edward be instantly seized by mate before discovered mistake holy virgin who what be cried struggling to disengage one who be very fond of pretty girl replied pirate still detaining unhand wretch cried clara be aware whom be addressing not do care replied pirate will perhaps sir when learn that be daughter of governor exclaimed clara pushing away yes by heaven be right pretty lady do care for governor daughter will fetch good ransom at event so come lad little help here for be a strong a young mule never mind water throw beaker into boat again have prize worth taking clara screamed be gagged with handkerchief lifted into boat immediately rowed back to schooner when mate came on board reported capture pirate be delighted at prospect of addition to prize money cain must not of course raise objection must have be so different from general practice that must have strengthened suspicion already set afloat by hawkhurst cain be most anxious just then to remove ordered girl to be taken down into cabin hoisted in boat breeze springing up again made sail in mean time francisco be consoling unfortunate clara assuring that need be under alarm promising protection of captain poor girl wept bitterly be not until cain came down into cabin corroborated assurance of francisco that must assume degree of composure to find friend when have expected insult degradation for francisco have acknowledged that vessel be pirate be consolation kindness attention of francisco restored to comparative tranquillity next day confided to reason of coming to beach mistake with regard to two vessel francisco cain promised that must pay ransom not wait until heard from father to divert thought francisco talked much about edward templemore on subject clara must always talk circumstance attending amour be soon known to francisco avenger did not gain rendezvous a soon a expected when to northward of porto rico english frigate bore down upon avenger be obliged to run for before wind be always schooner worst point of sailing chase be continued for three day before fresh wind from southward until have passed bahama isle pirate suffered much from want of water a be necessary still further to reduce allowance frigate be still in sight although avenger have dropped astern when wind became light at last subsided into calm lasted two day more boat of frigate be hoisted out on eve of second day to attack schooner then distant five mile when breeze sprang up from northward schooner being then to windward enemy hull down be not until next day cain ventured to run again to southward to procure at one of key water so much required at last be obtained with difficulty much loss of time from scantiness of supply again made sail for caicos be so much impeded by contrary wind contrary current that be not until three week after have be chased from porto rico that made out low land of former rendezvous must now return to edward templemore in enterprise whom left off coast of south america in search of avenger have so strangely slipped through finger edward have examined whole coast ran through passage round trinidad then started off to leeward isle in pursuit have spoken vessel met with without gaining information have at last arrived off porto rico be time to think of clara a be not out of way have run down island a be just before dark when arrived off that part of coast where governor resided have hove to for little while have examined window signal of recognition be not made after waiting till dark again made sail mad with disappointment fearing that have be discovered by governor whereas fact be that have only arrived two day after forcible abduction of clara once more directed attention to discovery of pirate after fortnight examination of inlet bay of island of st domingo without success provision water being nearly expended returned in very happy mood to port royal in mean time disappearance of clara have created greatest confusion in porto rico upon examination of attendant who be confronted by friar duenna amour of mistress be confessed appearance of avenger off coast on evening confirmed idea that donna clara have be carried off by english lieutenant don alfarez immediately despatched vessel to jamaica complaining of outrage demanding restoration of daughter vessel arrived at port royal few day before enterprise admiral be very much astonished returned very polite answer to don alfarez promising investigation immediately upon arrival of schooner to send vessel with result of said investigation be pretty business said admiral to secretary young madcap sent to look after pirate go after governor daughter by lord harry mr templemore will have account to settle can hardly believe sir replied secretary yet doe look suspicious on so short acquaintance who know that mr hadley send for log let examine may have be keeping up acquaintance log of enterprise be examined there be fatal word porto rico porto rico bearing in division of compass in separate cruise nay even when schooner be charged with despatch plain enough said admiral confounded young scamp to embroil in way not that marrying girl be business of mine will punish for disobedience of order at event try by court martial by heaven secretary made reply knew very well that admiral must do such thing enterprise anchored at daylight sir reported secretary a admiral sat down to breakfast where be mr templemore be outside in veranda have told below of what have be accused swears be false believe sir for appears half mad at intelligence stop moment have looked over log yes sir appears that be off porto rico on th spanish governor letter say that be there on th again made appearance on th mentioned to declares upon honour that be only there on th a stated in log well let come in speak for edward came in in state of great agitation well mr templemore have be playing pretty trick what be sir where be girl sir governor daughter where be sir can not pretend to say feel convinced that have be carried off by pirate pirate poor girl pity pity too edward come sit down here tell have happened edward knew admiral character so well that immediately disclosed have passed between clara then stated how avenger have escaped by deceiving frigate agreement made with clara to meet for future on beach conviction that pirate schooner so exactly similar in appearance to enterprise must have preceded at porto rico have carried off object of attachment although edward might have be severely taken to task yet admiral pitied therefore said nothing about visit to porto rico when breakfast be over ordered signal to be made for sloop of war to prepare to weigh enterprise to be revictualled by boat of squadron now edward comus will sail in company after rascally pirate trust will give good account of also of governor daughter cheer up boy depend upon will try for ransom before do injury that evening enterprise comus sailed on expedition having run by porto rico delivered letter to governor steered to northward early next morning made land of caicos just a avenger have skirted reef bore up for narrow entrance there be exclaimed edward there be by heaven making signal for enemy be immediately answered by comus chapter sixteen caicos small patch of island called caicos cayques be situated about two degree to northward of saint domingo be nearly southernmost of chain extends up to bahamas most of island of chain be uninhabited be formerly resort of piratical vessel reef shoal with be surrounded afforded protection from larger pursuer passage through dangerous navigation being known only to pirate who frequented proved additional security largest of caicos island form curve like opened horseshoe to southward with safe protected anchorage when once in bay on southern side previous to arriving at anchorage there be coral reef extending upwards of forty mile through be necessary to conduct vessel passage be extremely intricate be well known to hawkhurst who have hitherto be pilot cain be not so well acquainted with required greatest care in taking in vessel a on present occasion hawkhurst must not be called upon for service island for there be several of be composed of coral rock few cocoa tree raised lofty head where there be sufficient earth for vegetation stunted brush wood rose up between interstice of rock chief peculiarity of island rendered suitable to who frequented be numerous cave with rock be perforated above high water mark majority with sea water flowing in out of in case merely rushing in at high water filling deep pool be detached from other when tide receded in others with sufficient depth of water at time to allow to pull in with large boat be hardly necessary to observe how convenient higher dry cave be a receptacle for article be intended to be concealed until opportunity occurred for disposing of in last chapter stated just a avenger have entered passage through reef comus enterprise hove in sight discovered will be necessary to explain position of vessel avenger have entered southern channel with wind from southward have carefully sounded way for about four mile under little sail enterprise comus have be examining turk island to eastward of caicos have passed to northward of on larboard tack standing in for northern point of reef joined on to great caicos island be therefore in situation to intercept avenger before arrived at anchorage have not be for reef barred passage only plan english vessel must act upon be to beat to southward so a to arrive at entrance of passage when enterprise must of course find sufficient water to follow avenger for a passage be too narrow to beat through wind be from southward avenger must not possibly escape be caught in trap that have to trust to be defence might be able to make in stronghold against force must be employed in attack breeze be fresh from southward appeared inclined to increase when comus enterprise made sail worked in short tack outside reef on board avenger enemy motion be clearly distinguished cain perceived that be in awkward dilemma that must be attacked have doubt although at other time must almost have rejoiced in such opportunity of discomfiting assailant yet now thought very differently must have sacrificed almost everything to have be able to avoid rencontre be permitted quietly to withdraw from associate without spilling of more blood francisco be equally annoyed at unfortunate collision word be exchanged between pirate captain during time that be on deck be about nine o'clock when having safely passed nearly half through channel cain ordered kedge anchor to be dropped sent down people to breakfast francisco went down into cabin be explaining situation to clara when cain entered threw on locker appeared lost in deep sombre meditation what do intend to do said francisco know will not decide francisco replied cain if be to act upon own judgment probably must allow schooner to remain where be can only attack in boat in such case fear whereas if run right through allow other schooner to follow without defending passage may be attacked by in deep water inside overpowered by number of men two vessel will be able to bring against on other hand certainly may defend schooner from shore a well a on board be weak handed will however call up ship company let decide god know if left to must not fight at be there way of escape resumed francisco yes might abandon schooner night when must not expect run with boat through channel between great island north cayque dare propose men must not listen to indeed very much doubt if enemy will allow time knew morning long before saw vessel fate must be decided before sun went down what do mean mean francisco said cain that mother who always have visited in dream whenever anything dreadful now to think of be about to take place appeared to last night there be sorrow pity in sweet face a mournfully waved hand a if to summon to follow yes thank god no longer looked upon a for many year have done francisco made answer cain again seemed to be lost in meditation after little while cain rose taking small packet from one of drawer put into hand of francisco preserve said pirate captain must accident happen to will tell who be mother also contains direction for finding treasure have buried leave everything to francisco have be unfairly obtained be not guilty party there be none to claim answer now may find friend whom will make after be gone of same opinion a be tell again be careful of packet see little chance of availing replied francisco if live will not be considered a pirate can prove contrary have doubt god will be done yes god will be done said cain mournfully dared not have said that month ago pirate captain went on deck followed by francisco crew of avenger be summoned aft called upon to decide a to measure considered to be most advisable preferred weighing anchor running into bay where must be able to defend schooner in opinion much better than by remaining where be crew of pirate schooner weighed anchor continued precarious course breeze have freshened water be in strong ripple so that must no longer see danger beneath bottom in meantime sloop of war enterprise continued to turn to windward outside reef by noon wind have considerably increased breaker now turned broke in wild foam over coral reef in direction sail be still more reduced on board avenger difficulty increased from rapidity of motion storm jib be set others hauled down yet even under small sail flew before wind cain stood at bowsprit giving direction to helmsman more than once have grazed rock be clear again spar be towed astern mean resorted to to check way have guide breaking of wild water on side of why must not hawkhurst who know passage so well be made to pilot said boatswain to who be near on forecastle to be sure let have up cried several of crew of went down below in minute reappeared with hawkhurst whom led forward did not make resistance crew demanded that must pilot vessel suppose will not said hawkhurst coolly then lose passage be replied boatswain be not so lad continued appealing to crew yes take safe in overboard replied several mind threat lad replied hawkhurst have known a good man true be not likely that will desert now well since captain there can not save suppose must exclaimed looking about how be be out of passage already yes whether can get into again can not tell be not out of passage said cain know be not well then if captain know better than have better take through rejoined hawkhurst crew thought differently insisted that hawkhurst who well knew channel must take charge cain retired aft a hawkhurst went out on bowsprit will do best lad said hawkhurst recollect if strike in trying to get into right channel blame starboard little starboard yet steady so there be true passage lad cried pointing to smoother water between breaker port little steady hawkhurst who knew that be to be put on shore a soon a convenient have resolved to lose schooner even if own life be forfeited be now running out of passage on rock minute after have conned struck heavily again again third time struck came broadside to wind heeled over sharp coral rock found way through slight timber planking water poured in rapidly during there be dead silence on part of marauder lad said hawkhurst have done best now may throw overboard if please be not fault continued pointing to captain be of little consequence whose fault be mr hawkhurst replied cain will settle point by by at present have too much on hand out boat men a fast a can let man provide with arm ammunition be cool schooner be fixed hard enough will not go down will save everything by by pirate obeyed order of captain three boat be hoisted out lowered down in first be placed wounded men clara d'alfarez who be assisted up by francisco a soon a men have provided with arm francisco to protect clara offered to take charge of boat shoved off men of war have seen avenger strike on rock preparation of crew to take to boat immediately hove to hoisted out manned own boat with hope of cutting off before must gain island prepare for vigorous defence for although vessel must not approach reef there be sufficient water in many place for boat to pas over shortly after francisco in first boat have shoved off from avenger boat of men of war be darting through surf to intercept pirate perceived hastened arrangement second boat soon left into hawkhurst leaped a be shoving off cain remained on board going round lower deck to ascertain if of wounded men be left then quitted schooner in last boat followed others being about quarter of mile astern of second in hawkhurst have secured place at time cain quitted schooner be difficult to say whether men of war boat must succeed in intercepting of pirate boat party exerted to utmost when first boat with francisco clara landed headmost of assailant be not much more than mile from willow water intervening there be delay be favourable to pirate hawkhurst landed in boat a launch of comus fired eighteen pound carronade last boat be yet two hundred yard from beach when shot from comus launch have be unable hitherto to find passage through reef struck on counter filled went down be gone exclaimed francisco who have led clara to cave stood at mouth of to protect have sunk boat be swimming to shore will be here soon long before english seaman can land be true cain be breasting water manfully making for small cove nearer to where boat be sunk than one in francisco have landed with clara wounded men divided from other by ridge of rock separated sandy beach extended way into water before be submerged francisco must easily distinguish pirate captain from other men who also be swimming for beach for cain be far ahead of a gained nearer to shore be shut from francisco sight by ridge of rock francisco anxious for safety climbed up rock be watching cain be within few yard of beach when there be report of musket pirate captain be seen to raise body convulsively half out of water floundered clear blue wave be discoloured sank be seen no more francisco darted forward from rock perceived hawkhurst standing beneath with musket in hand be recharging villain exclaimed francisco will account for hawkhurst have reprimed musket shut pan not to replied hawkhurst levelling piece taking aim at ball struck francisco on breast reeled back from position staggered across sand gained cave fell at foot of clara oh god exclaimed poor girl be hurt who be there then to protect hardly know replied francisco faintly at interval feel wound feel stronger put hand to heart clara opened vest found that packet given to francisco by cain have deposited in breast have be struck by bullet have done injury further than violent concussion of blow notwithstanding be faint from shock head fell upon clara bosom must relate proceeding of who be mixed up in exciting scene edward templemore have watched from vessel with eager painful curiosity motion of schooner running on rock subsequent action of intrepid marauder long telescope enabled to perceive distinctly passed feeling be increased into paroxysm of agony when straining eye beheld white fluttering habiliment of female for moment at gunwale of stranded vessel descent a appeared to nothing into boat arm held out to receive extension of hers to meet offered must be clara where be reluctance unavailing attempt at resistance must have characterised situation excited by feeling dared not analyse threw down glass seizing sword sprang into boat be ready manned alongside desiring others to follow for once only time in existence when approaching enemy did feel heart sink within cold tremor ran through whole frame a called to mind loose moral desperate habit of pirate horrible thought entered imagination a neared shore stood up in stern sheet of boat pale haggard with trembling lip intensity of feeling must have be intolerable for more violent thirst for revenge clenched sword while quick throb of heart seemed at pulsation to repeat to thought of blood blood blood approached small bay perceived that there be female at mouth of cave nearer nearer be certain that be clara name be on lip when heard two shot fired one after by hawkhurst saw retreat fall of francisco when madness to behold perceived clara rush forward there lay young man supported by with head on bosom must believe what saw must really be betrothed yes there be supporting handsome figure of young man man pirate have even put hand into vest be now watching over reviving form edward must bear no more covered eye now maddened with jealousy in voice of thunder called out give way lad for life give way gig be within dozen stroke of oar from beach clara unconscious of wrong have just taken packet of paper from francisco vest when hawkhurst made appearance from behind rock separated two little sandy cove francisco have recovered breath perceiving approach of hawkhurst sprang upon foot to recover musket before must succeed have closed in with short dreadful struggle ensued must soon have terminated fatally to francisco for superior strength of hawkhurst have enabled to bear down body of opponent with knee be fast strangling by twisting handkerchief round throat while clara shrieked attempted in vain to tear pirate from a prostrate francisco be fast blackening into corse maiden screamed for pity became frantic in effort for rescue boat dashed high up on sand with bound of maddened tiger edward sprang upon hawkhurst tearing down on back severing wrist with sword blade until hold of francisco be relaxed wrestled in own defence seize lad said edward pointing with left hand to hawkhurst a with sword directed to body of francisco bitterly continued victim be mine be intention be frustrated by clara recognition who shrieked out edward sprang into arm be immediately in state of insensibility seaman who have secured hawkhurst looked upon scene with curious astonishment while edward waited with mingled feeling of impatience doubt for clara recovery wished to be assured by that be mistaken turned again again from face to of francisco who be fast recovering during painful suspense hawkhurst be bound made to sit down edward dear edward said clara at last in faint voice clinging more closely to be then rescued by thee dearest edward felt appeal jealousy have not yet subsided who be that clara said sternly be francisco pirate edward preserver have have laughed hawkhurst with bitter sneer for perceived how matter stood edward templemore turned towards with inquiring look have have continued hawkhurst why be captain son pirate eh well what will woman not swear to to save dote upon if captain son said edward why be contending because just now shot scoundrel father edward said clara solemnly be time for explanation a hope for mercy what have said be true believe not villain yes said francisco who be now sitting up believe when say that shot captain for be true sir if value own peace of mind believe nothing to prejudice of young lady hardly know what to believe muttered edward templemore a lady say be time for explanation with permission madam said to clara coxswain will see in safety on board of schooner other vessel if prefer duty will not allow to accompany clara darted reproachful yet fond look on edward a with swimming eye be led by coxswain to boat have be joined by launch of comus crew of be with officer wading to beach men of gig remained until have given hawkhurst francisco in charge of other seaman then shoved off with clara for schooner edward templemore gave one look at gig a conveyed clara on board ordering hawkhurst francisco to be taken to launch guard to be kept over went up with remainder of men in pursuit of pirate during scene have described other boat of men of war have landed on island avenger crew deprived of leader scattered in direction be many of slain captured in about two hour be supposed that majority of pirate have be accounted for prisoner being now very numerous be decided that boat must return with to comus captain of vessel a commanding officer must then issue order a to future proceeding captured pirate when mustered on deck of comus amounted to nearly sixty out of number one half be who have be sent on shore wounded have surrendered without resistance of killed there be fifteen be conjectured that a many more have be drowned in boat when be sunk by shot from carronade of launch although by account given by captured pirate majority be secured yet there be reason to suppose that be still left on island concealed in cave a captain of comus have order to return a soon a possible decided to sail immediately for port royal with prisoner leaving enterprise to secure remainder if there be recover anything of value might be left in wreck of avenger then to destroy with usual celerity of service order be obeyed pirate among whom francisco be included be secured boat hoisted up in hour comus displayed ensign made sail on wind leaving edward templemore with enterprise at back of reef to perform duty entailed upon clara who be on board of schooner to remove

evidence be read over to pirate be asked if have anything to offer in defence question be repeated by judge when hawkhurst be first to speak to save must scarcely hope only object be to prevent francisco pleading cause successfully escaping same disgraceful death hawkhurst declared that have be time on board avenger that have be taken out of vessel forced to serve against will a must be proved by captain son who stood there pointing to francisco who have be in schooner since first fitting out that have always opposed captain who must not part with because be only one on board who be competent to navigate schooner that have intended to rise against take vessel having often stimulated crew so to do that a other men a well a captain son must prove if chose actually be in confinement for attempt when schooner be entering passage to caicos that be only released because be acquainted with passage threatened to be thrown overboard if did not take in at risk have run her on rock aware that captain must murder have shot cain a be swimming to shore a captain son must prove for have taxed with be actually struggling with for life when officer boat crew separated made prisoner that hardly expected that francisco captain son must tell truth to save a be bitter enemy in business at magdalen river have be long planned for francisco have be sent on shore under pretence of being wrecked in fact to ascertain where booty be to assist pirate in attack francisco have taken opportunity of putting bullet through shoulder be well known to other pirate francisco must not venture to deny trusted that court must order torture to francisco then must probably speak truth at event let speak now when hawkhurst have ceased to address court there be anxious pause for minute day be fast declining most part of spacious court house be already deeply immersed in gloom while light sober solemn almost sad gleamed upon savage reckless countenance of prisoner at bar sun have sunk down behind mass of heavy yet gorgeous cloud fringing edge with molten gold hawkhurst have spoken fluently energetically there be appearance of almost honesty in coarse deep toned voice even occasional oath with speech be garnished have omitted seemed to be pronounced more in sincerity than in blasphemy gave more forcible impression to narrative have said that when concluded there be profound silence amid fast falling shadow of evening who be present began to feel for first time awful importance of drama before number of life be trembling upon verge of existence depending upon single word of guilty painful silence harrowing suspense be at last broken by restrained sob from female owing to obscurity involving body of court person must not be distinguished wail of woman so unexpected for who must there be of sex interested in fate of desperate men touched heart of auditor appeared to sow first seed of compassionate humane feeling among who have hitherto expressed felt nothing indignation towards prisoner judge upon bench counsel at bar jury impannelled in box felt force of appeal softened down evil impression created by address of hawkhurst against youthful francisco eye of be now directed towards one doubly accused accused not only by public prosecutor even by associate in crime survey be favourable acknowledged that be one whose personal quality might indeed challenge love of woman in pride lament in disgrace a regard be directed towards sun have be obscured now pierced through break in mass of cloud threw portion of glorious beam from window opposite upon alone while other prisoner who surrounded be buried more le in deep shadow be at once evident that associate be bold yet commonplace villain men who owed courage only virtue perhaps to habit to physical organisation influence of around be mere human butcher with only adjunct now that trade be to be exercised upon must bear with sullen apathy feeling how far removed from true fortitude even hawkhurst though more commanding than rest with daring mien scowl of defiance looked nothing more than distinguished ruffian with exception of francisco prisoner have wholly neglected personal appearance in squalid sordid look of mendicant seemed allied with ferocity of murderer francisco be not only exception formed beautiful contrast to others a evening beam lighted up figure stood at bar if not with splendour of hero of romance certainly most picturesque interesting personage elegantly if not richly attired low sob at interval repeated a if impossible to be checked seemed to rouse call to sense of important part be called upon to act in tragedy there then performing face be pale yet composed mien at once proud sorrowful eye be bright yet glance be not upon in court far away fixed like eagle upon gorgeous beam of setting sun glowed upon through window be in front of at last voice of francisco be heard in wide court started at sound deep full melodious a evening chime ear of present have in profound silence just recovered from harsh deep toned barbarous idiom of hawkhurst address when clear silvery yet manly voice of francisco riveted attention jury stretched head counsel in court turned anxiously round towards prisoner even judge held up forefinger to intimate wish for perfect silence lord gentleman commenced francisco when first found in degrading situation have not thought to have spoken to have uttered one word in defence have just now accused have recommended torture to be applied have already have wish for what torture can be more agonising than to find where now be so tortured indeed have be through short yet wretched life have often felt that anything short of self destruction must release must be blessing within few minute have be made to acknowledge have still feeling in unison with fellow creature be not yet fit for death too young too unprepared to die for who must not reluctantly leave world while there be such beauteous sky to love look upon while there be one female breast who hold innocent have evinced pity for misfortune yes lord mercy pity compassion have not yet fled from earth therefore do feel be too young to die god forgive thought have for never have be shown in with whom by fate have be connected have be from conviction have so often longed for death now may that righteous god who judge not here hereafter enable to prove that deserve ignominious punishment from fellow sinner men lord know not subtlety of law intricacy of pleading first let assert have never robbed have restored unto plundered have never murdered have stood between assassin knife victim for have be hated reviled by associate for be life now threatened by law against never have offended man who last addressed have told that be pirate captain son be assertion of only irreclaimable utterly remorseless villain among who now stand before to be judged assertion of one whose glory whose joy whose solace have be blood shedding lord have from mouth of captain previous to murder by man be not son son thank god not so connected with in power be most certainly most incomprehensibly before died delivered packet must have told who be have lost deeply have felt loss one only fact gained from whom must call father be that with own hand slew yes basely slew mother address of francisco be here interrupted by low deep groan of anguish startled whole audience be now quite dark judge ordered court to be lighted previous to defence being continued impatience anxiety of present be shown in low murmur of communication until light be brought in word silence from judge produced immediate obedience prisoner be ordered to proceed francisco then continued address commencing with remembrance of earliest childhood a warmed with subject became more eloquent action became energetical without violence pallid modest youth gradually grew into impassioned inspired orator recapitulated rapidly yet distinctly with terrible force startling event in fearful life there be truth in tone of voice there be conviction in animated countenance there be innocence in open expressive brow who heard believed scarcely have concluded address when jury appeared impatient to rise give verdict in favour judge stood up addressing jury told that be most painful duty to remind that a yet have heard assertion beautiful almost convincing assertion truly still be not proof ala observed francisco what evidence can bring forward except evidence of around at bar will not be admitted can recall dead from grave can expect who have be murdered to rise again to assert innocence can expect that don cumanos will appear from distant league to give evidence on behalf ala know not how be situated must have flown to succour not even can expect that sweet spanish maiden last to whom offered protection will appear in such place a to meet bold gaze of hundred be here replied manly voice passage be made through crowd clara supported by edward templemore dressed in uniform be ushered into box for witness appearance of fair girl who looked round with alarm created great sensation a soon a be sufficiently composed be sworn gave evidence a to francisco behaviour during time that be prisoner on board of avenger produced packet have saved life of francisco substantiated great part of defence extolled kindness generosity when have concluded one asked of can young man be pirate murderer reply be be impossible lord said edward templemore request permission to ask prisoner question when be on board of wreck of avenger found book floating in cabin wish to ask prisoner whether a young lady have informed be edward templemore produced bible be mine replied francisco may ask by what mean came into possession be only relic left of one who be now no more be consolation of murdered mother have since be mine give to sir may probably need support now more than ever be mother murdered say cried edward templemore with much agitation have already said so now repeat judge again rose recapitulated evidence to jury evidently friendly to francisco be obliged to point out to that although evidence of young lady have produced much might be offered in extenuation induce to submit to majesty in hope of gracious pardon after condemnation yet that many act in prisoner have be involved have endangered life testimony have be brought forward to prove that have not at one time acted with pirate although might since have repented must of course remember that evidence of mate hawkhurst be not of value must dismiss impression might have made against francisco at same time have unpleasant duty to point out that evidence of spanish lady be so far prejudicial that pointed out good term subsisting between young man pirate captain much a be interested in fate must reluctantly remind jury that evidence on whole be not sufficient to clear prisoner considered duty to return verdict of guilty against prisoner at bar lord said edward templemore few second after judge have resumed seat may not content of packet seal of have not ventured to break afford evidence in favour of prisoner have objection that must be opened previous to jury delivering verdict none replied judge what be supposed content content lord replied francisco be in writing of pirate captain delivered that packet into hand previous to quitting schooner stating that must inform who be parent lord in present situation claim that packet refuse that content must be read in court if be to die ignominious death at least who be connected with will not have to blush at disgrace for secret of parentage will die with nay nay be ruled by replied edward templemore with much emotion in narrative handwriting of can be proved by king evidence there may be acknowledgment of have stated will be received a evidence will not lord if handwriting be proved must think may replied judge particularly a lady be present when packet be delivered heard captain assertion will allow to be offered a evidence young man lord replied francisco unless have permission first to peruse will not have content divulged unless be sure of honourable acquittal jury must deliver verdict jury turned round to consult during edward templemore walked to francisco accompanied by clara to entreat to allow packet to be opened francisco be firm against entreaty at last foreman of jury rose to deliver verdict solemn awful silence prevailed throughout court suspense be painful to degree lord said foreman of jury verdict be stop sir said edward templemore a clasped one arm round astonished francisco extended other towards foreman stop sir harm not for be brother preserver cried clara kneeling on other side of francisco holding up hand in supplication announcement be electrical foreman dropped into seat judge whole court be in mute astonishment dead silence be followed by confusion to after time judge in vain attempted to put stop edward templemore clara francisco continued to form same group never be there one more beautiful now that be together one in court perceived strong resemblance between two young men francisco complexion be darker than edward from constant exposure from infancy to tropical sun feature of two be same be time before judge must obtain silence in court when have be obtained be puzzled how to proceed edward francisco who have exchanged few word be now standing side by side lord said edward templemore prisoner consent that packet will be opened do said francisco mournfully although have little hope from content ala now have everything to live for not that cling to life feel a if chance be gone day of miracle have passed nothing miracle of reappearance of pirate captain from grave can prove innocence reappears from grave to prove thine innocence francisco said deep hollow voice startled whole court most of hawkhurst prisoner at bar still more did fear horror distort countenance when into witness box stalked giant form of cain be no longer figure have described in commencement of narrative beard have be removed be pale wan emaciated sunken eye hollow cheek short cough interrupted speech proved that day be nearly at close lord said cain addressing judge be pirate cain be captain of avenger still be free come here voluntarily that may attest innocence of young man a yet hand have not known manacle foot gyves be not prisoner included in indictment at present evidence be good none know in court except whose testimony a prisoner be unavailing therefore to save boy only to save demand may be sworn oath be administered with more than usual solemnity lord gentleman of jury have be in court since commencement of trial declare that word francisco have uttered in own defence be true be totally innocent of act of piracy murder packet must indeed have proved a much in packet there be secret wished to remain unknown to francisco rather than must be opened have come forward how young officer discovered that francisco be brother know not if also be son of cecilia templemore be true packet will explain now lord that evidence be received be content have done one good deed before die surrender a pirate foul murderer to justice true life be nearly closed thanks to villain there prefer must meet that death merit a expiation of many deed of guilt cain then turned to hawkhurst who be close to mate appeared to be in state of stupor have not recovered from first terror still imagined appearance of cain to be supernatural villain exclaimed cain putting mouth close to hawkhurst ear doubly damned villain thou'lt die like dog unrevenged boy be safe be alive art thou really living said hawkhurst recovering from fear yes living yes flesh blood feel wretch feel arm be convinced thou hast felt power of before now continued cain sarcastically now lord have done francisco fare thee well loved thee have proved love hate not then memory forgive yes forgive when be more said cain who then turned eye to ceiling of court house yes there be francisco there be see cried extending arm above head smile upon yes francisco sainted mother smile pardon sentence be not finished for hawkhurst when cain arm be upheld perceived knife in girdle with rapidity of thought drew out passed through body of pirate captain cain fell heavily on floor while court be again in confusion hawkhurst be secured cain raised from ground thank thee hawkhurst said cain in expiring voice murder thou hast to answer for have saved from disgrace not of gallows of gallows in thy company francisco boy farewell cain groaned deeply expired thus perished renowned pirate captain who in life have shed so much blood whose death produced murder blood for blood body be removed now remained for jury to give verdict prisoner be found guilty with exception of francisco who left dock accompanied by newly found brother congratulation of individual who must gain access to chapter eighteen conclusion first object will be to explain to reader by what mean edward templemore be induced to surmise in francisco whom considered a rival have found brother also to account for reappearance of pirate cain in pursuance of order edward templemore have proceeded on board of wreck of avenger while men be employed in collecting article of great value be on board of have descended into cabin be partly under water have picked up book floating near locker on examination found to be bible surprised at seeing book on board of pirate have taken with when returned to enterprise have shown to clara who immediately recognised a property of francisco book be saturated with salt water a edward mechanically turned over page referred to title page to see if there be name upon there be not observed that blank fly leaf next to binding have be pasted down that there be writing on other side in present state be easily detached from cover then to astonishment read name of cecilia templemore own mother knew well history how have be saved mother brother supposed to be lost may readily be imagined how great be anxiety to ascertain by what mean bible have come into possession of francisco dared not think francisco be brother that be so closely connected with one still supposed to be pirate circumstance be possible although have intended to have remained few day longer now listened to entreaty of clara whose peculiar position on board be only to be justified by peculiar position from have be rescued returning that evening to wreck set fire to then made sail for port royal fortunately arrived a have stated on day of trial a soon a signal be made by admiral immediately manned gig taking clara with in case evidence might be of use arrived at court house when trial be about half over in last chapter one stated that cain have be wounded by hawkhurst when be swimming on shore have sunk ball have entered chest passed through lung contest between hawkhurst francisco capture by edward have taken place on other side of ridge of rock in adjacent cove although francisco have seen cain disappear concluded that be dead be not so have again risen above water dropping foot finding bottom contrived to crawl out wade into cave adjacent where lay down to die in cave there be one of avenger boat two of pirate mortally wounded four kroumen who have concealed there with intention of taking part in conflict a soon a became dark of making escape in boat have hauled up dry into cave cain staggered in recovered dry land fell pompey krouman perceiving condition went to assistance bound up wound stanching of blood soon revived pirate captain other pirate died unaided although island be searched in direction cave from water flowing into escaped vigilance of british seaman when re embarked with majority of pirate captured cain kroumen be undiscovered a soon a be dark cain informed of intention although kroumen must probably have left to fate yet a required service to know how to steer to other island be assisted into stern sheet boat be backed out of cave by direction of cain passed through passage between great island northern caique before daylight be far away from chance of capture cain have now to certain degree recovered knowing that be in channel of small trader pointed out to kroumen that if supposed to be pirate must inevitably be punished although not guilty that must pas off a crew of small coasting vessel have be wrecked then with assistance of pompey cut off beard a close a must arranged dress in more european style have water provision be exposed to vertical sun fortunately for still more fortunately for francisco on second day be picked up by american brig bound to antigua cain narrated fictitious disaster said nothing about wound neglect of must certainly have occasioned death very few day after appeared at trial have not fallen by malignity of hawkhurst anxious to find way to port royal for be indifferent a to own life only wished to save francisco be overjoyed to meet small schooner trading between island bound to port royal in vessel obtained passage for kroumen have arrived three day previous to trial during time have remained concealed until day that admiralty court assembled may be a well here to remark cain reason for not wishing packet to be opened be that among other paper relative to francisco be direction for recovery of treasure have concealed of course wished to be communicated to francisco alone will leave reader to imagine what passed between francisco edward after discovery of kindred proceed to state content of packet twin brother now opened in presence of clara alone must however condense matter be very voluminous stated that cain whose real name be charles osborne have sailed in fine schooner from bilboa for coast of africa to procure cargo of slave have be out about twenty four hour when crew perceived boat apparently with one in about mile ahead of water be then smooth vessel have little way a soon a came up with boat lowered down skiff to examine men sent in skiff soon returned towing boat alongside lying at bottom of boat be found several men almost dead reduced to skeleton in stern sheet negro woman with child at breast white female in last state of exhaustion osborne be then gay unprincipled man not hardened villain murderer a afterwards became have compassion feeling be taken on board schooner recovered others be too much exhausted among restored be cecilia templemore infant who at first have be considered quite dead negro woman exhausted by demand of nursling privation expired a be being removed from boat goat fortunately be on board proved substitute for negress before osborne have arrived off coast child have recovered health vigour mother extreme beauty must now pas over considerable portion of narrative osborne be impetuous in passion cecilia templemore became victim have indeed afterwards quieted qualm of conscience by pretended marriage when arrived at brazil with cargo of human flesh be little alleviation of suffering who have be indulged in luxury who have be educated with greatest care be now lost for ever outcast from society to must never hope to return associating with dreaded despised passed day night in tear have soon more cause for sorrow from brutal treatment received from osborne who have be destroyer child be only solace for fear of leaving to demoralising influence of about must have laid down died lived for for attempted to recall osborne from career of increasing guilt bore meekly with reproach with blow at last osborne changed nefarious life for one of deeper guilt became pirate still carried with cecilia child be climax of misery now wasted from day to day grief must soon have terminated existence have not be hastened by cruelty of cain who upon expostulation on part followed up with denunciation of consequence of guilty career struck with such violence that sank under blow expired with prayer that child might be rescued from life of guilt when then repentant cain promised what never did perform blessed too before died such be substance of narrative a far a related to unfortunate mother of two young men who when have concluded sat hand in hand in mournful silence however be soon broken by innumerable question asked by edward of brother a to what must remember of ill fated parent be followed up by history of francisco eventful life treasure edward said francisco can not take possession of will replied edward belongs to captor must be shared a prize money will never touch one penny of will trust pocket very fair proportion of however keep paper a be addressed to admiral have be made acquainted with particular of eventful trial have sent message to edward requesting that a soon a brother must make

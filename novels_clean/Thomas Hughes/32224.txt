sydney prior hall new york macmillan co to mr arnold of fox howe book be without permission dedicated by author who owes more than can ever acknowledge forget to hers preface to sixth edition received following letter from old friend soon after last edition of book be published resolved if ever edition be called for to print for be clear from other like comment that something more must have be said expressly on subject of bullying how be to be met dear blame for not having earlier suggested whether must not in edition of tom brown story denounce more decidedly evil of bullying at school have indeed done so in best way by making flashman bully most contemptible character in scene of tossing similar passage hardly suggest that such thing must be stopped suggest mean of putting end to subject have be on mind for year fill with grief misery to think what weak nervous child go through at school how health character for life be destroyed by rough brutal treatment be comfort to be under old delusion that fear nervousness can be cured by violence that knocking about will turn timid boy into bold one now know well enough be not true gradually training timid child to do bold act must be most desirable frightening ill treating will not make courageous medical man know fatal effect of terror agitation excitement to nerve be over sensitive there be different kind of courage a have shown in character of arthur boy may have moral courage finely organized brain nervous system boy be calculated if judiciously educated to be great wise useful man may not posse animal courage one night tossing bullying may produce injury to brain nerve that usefulness be spoiled for life verily believe that hundred of noble organization be thus destroyed year horse jockey have learnt to be wiser know that highly nervous horse be utterly destroyed by harshness groom who tried to cure shying horse by roughness violence must be discharged a brute fool man who must regulate watch with crowbar must be considered as person who think child of delicate nervous organization can be made bold by bullying be better can be made bold by healthy exercise game sport be quite different thing even game sport must bear proportion to strength capacity very much doubt whether small child must play with big one rush of set of great fellow at football speed of cricket ball sent by strong hitter must be very alarming to mere child to child who might stand up boldly enough among child of own size height look at dozen small child playing cricket by how feeble be blow how slowly bowl can measure in way capacity tom brown eleven be bold enough playing against eleven of about own calibre suspect must have be in precious funk if have played against eleven giant whose bowling bore same proportion to theirs theirs doe to small child above to return to tossing must say think mean might be devised to enable school boy to go to bed in quietness peace that mean ought to be devised enforced good moral physical to who bully who be bullied can ensue from such scene a take place in dormitory of school suspect that british wisdom ingenuity be sufficient to discover remedy for evil if directed in right direction fact be that condition of small boy at large school be one of peculiar hardship suffering be entirely at mercy of proverbially roughest thing in universe great school boy be deprived of protection weak have in civilized society for may not complain if doe be outlaw have protector public opinion that public opinion of very lowest grade opinion of rude ignorant boy what do school boy know of deep question of moral physical philosophy of anatomy of mind body by treatment of child must be regulated why must law of civilization be suspended for school why must boy be left to herd together with law that of force cunning what must become of society if be constituted on same principle must be plunged into anarchy in week one of judge not long ago refused to extend protection of law to child who have be ill treated at school if party of navvy have given licking have brought case before magistrate must have thought if magistrate have refused to protect on ground that if such case be brought before might have fifty day from one town only now agree with that constant supervision of master be not desirable possible that telling tale constantly referring to master for protection must only produce ill will worse treatment if rightly understand book be effort to improve condition of school by improving tone of morality public opinion in book contains most indubitable proof that condition of younger boy at public school except under rare dictatorship of old brooke be one of great hardship suffering timid nervous boy be from morning till night in state of bodily fear be constantly tormented when trying to learn lesson play hour be occupied in fagging in horrid funk of cricket ball football violent sport of creature who to be giant go to bed in fear trembling worse than reality of rough treatment to be perhaps subjected believe there be only one complete remedy be not in magisterial supervision in telling tale in raising tone of public opinion among school boy in separation of boy of different age into different school there must be at least three different class of school first for boy from nine to twelve second for boy from twelve to fifteen third for above fifteen school must be in different locality there ought to be certain amount of supervision by master at time when there be special occasion for bullying eg in long winter evening when boy be congregated together in bedroom surely can not be impossibility to keep order protect weak at such time evil might arise from supervision must hardly be greater than produced by system divide boy into despot slave ever yours very truly fd question of how to adapt english public school education to nervous sensitive boy often highest noblest subject education have to deal with ought to be looked at from point of viewa therefore add few extract from letter of old friend school fellow than whom man in england be better able to speak on subject what be use of sorting boy by age unless do so by strength who be often real bully strong young dog of fourteen while victim may be one year two year older deny fact about bedroom there be trouble at time always will be so there be in nursery little girl who look like angel be bullying smallest twice to day bullying must be fought with in other way by getting not only sixth to put down lower fellow to scorn by eradicating mercilessly incorrigible master who really care for fellow be pretty sure to know instinctively who in house be likely to be bullied knowing fellow to be really victimised harassed be sure that can stop if be resolved there be many kind of annoyance sometimes of real cutting persecution for righteousness ' sake that ca stop more must all usher in world can do very much in many way to make shaft of wicked pointless though for quite other reason like to see very young boy launched at public school though deny wish must existence from time to time of bullying deny being constant condition of school life still more possibility of meeting by mean proposed wish to understate amount of bullying go on conviction be that must be fought like school evil more than by dynamic rather than mechanic by getting fellow to respect one rather than by sitting by with thick stick now having broken resolution never to write preface there be just two three thing must like to say word about several person for whose judgment have highest respect while saying very kind thing about book have added that great fault of be too much preaching hope will amend in matter must ever write again now most distinctly decline to do why whole object in writing at be to get chance of preaching when man come to time of life have bread to make very little time to spare be likely that will spend almost whole of yearly vacation in writing story just to amuse people think not at rate must do so myself fact be that can scarcely ever call on one of contemporary now day without running across boy already at school just ready to go there whose bright look supple limb remind of father out first meeting in old time can scarcely keep latin grammar out of own house longer sight of son nephew godson playing trap bat ball reading robinson crusoe make one ask whether there be something one must like to say to before take first plunge into stream of life away from own home while be yet shivering after first plunge sole object in writing be to preach to boy if ever write again will be to preach to other age ca see that man have business to write at unless have something thoroughly belief want to preach about if have chance of delivering of let by mean put in shape in will be most likely to get hearing let never be so carried away a to forget that preaching be object black soldier in west indian regiment tied up to receive couple of dozen for drunkenness cried out to captain who be exhorting to sobriety in future cap'n if preachee preachee if floggee floggee preachee floggee too to captain might have replied pompey must preach whenever see chance of being listened to never did before so now must have together hope may remember of there be one point have be made by several of reviewer who have noticed book be one a be writing preface can not pas over have stated that rugby undergraduate remember at university be solemn array boy turned into men before time semi political semi sacerdotal fraternity c giving idea arnold turned out set of young square toe who wore long fingered black glove talked with snuffle can only say that acquaintance must have be limited exceptional for be sure that one who have have anything like large continuous knowledge of boy brought up at rugby from time of book treat down to day will bear out in saying that mark by may know be genial hearty freshness youthfulness of character lose nothing of boy be worth keeping build up man upon be differentia a rugby boy if never have have lost must be not because be at rugby in spite of having be there stronger be in more deeply may be sure have drunk of spirit of school boyishness in highest sense be not incompatible with seriousness earnestness if like word betterb contrary can well believe that casual observer who have never be intimate with rugby boy of true stamp have met only in day society of university at wine breakfast party like may have seen good deal more of serious earnest side of character than of other for more boy be alive in le will have be able to conceal thought opinion of what be taking place under nose if greater part of did square with notion of what be right very likely showed pretty clearly that did not at risk of being taken for young prig may be open to charge of having old head on young shoulder think be always be a long a can remember so long a have young heart to keep head shoulder in order for one must think only gain what gave rugby boy character have enabled school believe to keep to day say fearlessly arnold teaching example above part of have be will not say sneered at certainly not approved unwearied zeal in creating moral thoughtfulness in boy with whom came into personal contact certainly did teach thank god for that must not cut life into slice say in slice action be indifferent need trouble head about one way in slice mind what be about for be important pretty muddle must have be in have done so taught that in wonderful world boy man can tell of action be indifferent not that by thoughtless word look may lead astray brother for whom christ died taught that life be whole made up of action thought longing great small noble ignoble therefore only true wisdom for boy man be to bring whole life into obedience to whose world live in who have purchased with blood that whether eat drink whatsoever do be to do in name to glory in such teaching faithfully a seems to following that of paul of tarsus who be in habit of meaning what said who laid down standard for man boy in time think lie with who say that such teaching will not do for now to show why teacher in nineteenth century be to preach lower standard than one in first however wo say that reviewer have not certain plausible ground for dictum for short time after boy have taken up such life a arnold must have urged upon have hard time of find judgment often at fault body intellect running away with into sort of pitfall coming down with crash more seriously buckle to work oftener mischance seem to happen in dust of tumble struggle unless be very extraordinary boy may often be too severe on comrade may think see evil in thing innocent may give offence when never meant at stage of career take reviewer come across not looking below surface a reviewer ought to do at once set poor boy down for prig pharisee when in likelihood be one of humblest truest most childlike of reviewer acquaintance let reviewer come across again in year two when thoughtful life have become habitual to fit a easily a skin if be honest think will see cause to reconsider judgment for will find boy grown into man enjoying day life a man can who have not found out whence come capacity for enjoyment who be giver of least of good thing of world humble a man can be who have not proved own powerlessness to do right in smallest act ever have to do tolerant a man can be who doe not live daily hourly in knowledge of how perfect love be for ever about path bearing with upholding footnote

that arthur must have singled out martin of fellow for friend old madman be very fellow thought will take scrambling over country after bird egg flower make run swim climb like indian not teach word of anything bad keep from lesson what luck so with more than usual heartiness dived into cupboard hauled out old knuckle bone of ham two three bottle of beer together with solemn pewter only used on

discomfort when be gone martin rose to follow tom stopped one go near new row said so may just a well stop here do verse then will have more talk will be end quiet besides praepostor come here now have be visited once half so table be cleared cloth restored three fell to work with gradus dictionary upon morning vulgus be three very fair example of way in such task be done at rugby in consulship of plancus doubtless method be little changed for there be nothing new under sun especially at school now be known unto boy who be at school rejoice in time honoured institution of vulgus commonly supposed to have be established by william of wykeham at winchester imported to rugby by arnold more for sake of line be learnt by heart with than for own intrinsic value a have always understood that be short exercise in greek latin verse on given subject minimum number of line being fixed for form master of form gave out at fourth lesson on previous day subject for next morning vulgus at first lesson boy have to bring vulgus ready to be looked over with vulgus certain number of line from one of latin greek poet then being construed in form have to be got by heart master at first lesson called up boy in form in order put on in line if must say seem to say by reading off master other boy book who stood near be sent back went below boy who did so say seem to say in case vulgus be looked over by master who gave entered in book to credit discredit of boy so many mark a composition merited at rugby vulgus line be first lesson other day in week tuesday thursday saturday a there be thirty eight week in school year be obvious to meanest capacity that master of form have to set one hundred fourteen subject year two hundred twenty eight two year so on now to person of moderate invention be considerable task human nature being prone to repeat will not be wondered that master gave same subject sometimes over again after certain lapse of time to meet rebuke bad habit of master school boy mind with accustomed ingenuity have invented elaborate system of tradition almost boy kept own vulgus written out in book book be duly handed down from boy to boy till if tradition have gone on till now suppose popular boy in whose hand bequeathed vulgus book have accumulated be prepared with three four vulguses on subject in heaven earth in more world than one unfortunate master can pitch upon at rate such lucky fellow have generally one for one for friend in time only objection to traditionary method of doing vulguses be risk that succession might have become confused so that follower of tradition must show up same identical vulgus fine morning in case when happened considerable grief be result when did such risk hinder boy men from short cut pleasant path now in study night tom be upholder of traditionary method of vulgus doing carefully produced two large vulgus book began diving into picking out line here ending there tag a be vulgarly called till have gotten that thought must make fit then proceeded to patch tag together with help of gradus producing incongruous feeble result of eight elegiac line minimum quantity for form finishing up with two highly moral line extra making ten in cribbed entire from one of book beginning o genus humanum must have used dozen time before whenever unfortunate wicked hero of nation language under sun be subject indeed began to have great doubt whether master must remember so only threw in a extra line because in case must call off attention from other tag if detected being extra line must be sent back to do two more in place while if passed muster again must get mark for second method pursued by martin may be called dogged prosaic method no more than tom took pleasure in task having old vulgus book of own one else must not follow traditionary method for too a tom remarked have genius martin then proceeded to write down eight line in english of most matter of fact kind first came into head to convert line by line by main force of gradus dictionary into latin must scan be cared for to produce eight line with false quantity concord whether word be apt what sense be mattered nothing a article be new not line beyond minimum did follower of dogged method ever produce third artistic method be arthur considered first what point in character event be subject must most neatly be brought out within limit of vulgus trying always to get idea into eight line not binding to ten even twelve line if must do then set to work a much a possible without gradus other help to clothe idea in appropriate latin greek must not be satisfied till have polished well up with aptest most poetic word phrase must get at fourth method indeed be used in school of too simple kind to require comment may be called vicarious method obtained amongst big boy of lazy bullying habit consisted simply in making clever boy whom must thrash do whole vulgus for construe to afterwards latter be method not to be encouraged strongly advise not to practise of others will find traditionary most troublesome unless can steal vulguses whole experto crede that artistic method pay best in mark other way vulguses being finished by nine o'clock martin having rejoiced above measure in abundance of light of gradus dictionary other convenience almost unknown to for getting through work having be pressed by arthur to come do verse there whenever liked three boy went down to martin den arthur be initiated into lore of bird egg to great delight exquisite colouring form astonished charmed who have scarcely ever

must have be stopped anyhow that be great favourite with old gentleman who loved to come out in afternoon into close to tom wicket bowl slow twister to talk of glory of bygone surrey hero with whom have played in former generation so tom roused took up candle to go to bed then for first time be aware of beautiful new fishing rod with old eton mark on splendidly bound bible lay on table on title page of be written tom brown from affectionate grateful friend france jane arthur george arthur leave to guess how slept what dreamt of chapter vii harry east dilemma deliverance holy supper be kept indeed in whatso share with need not that give what share for gift without giver be bare who bestows with alms feed three hungering neighbour vision of sir launfal lowell p next morning after breakfast tom east gower met a usual to learn second lesson together tom have be considering how to break proposal of giving up crib to others having found better way a indeed none better can ever be found by man boy told simply what have happened how have be to see arthur who have talked to upon subject what have said for part have made up mind be going to use crib more not being quite sure of ground took high pathetic tone be proceeding to say how having learnt lesson with for so many year must grieve much to put end to arrangement hoped at rate that if must go on with must still be just a good friend respect one motif here other boy who have be listening with open eye ear burst in stuff nonsense cried gower here east get down crib find place oh tommy tommy said east proceeding to do a be bidden that must ever have come to knew arthur 'd be ruin of day of now time come made doleful face know about ruin answered tom know that must have have sack long ago if have be for know a well a well be in baddish way before came own new crotchet of be past joke let give trial harry come know how often have be right wrong now two be jawing away about young square toe struck in gower be end of sucking wiseacre dare say have time to lose have got five court at half past nine say gower said tom appealingly be good fellow let try if ca get on without crib what in chorus why sha get through ten line say tom cried east having hit on new idea remember when be in upper fourth old momus caught construing off leaf of crib 'd torn out put in book must float out on to floor sent up to be flogged for yes remember very well well doctor after 'd flogged told that did flog for using translation for taking into lesson using there when have learnt word before came in said there be harm in using translation to get clue to hard passage if tried must first to make out without did though said tom then arthur must be wrong of course be said gower little prig will only use crib when ca construe without go ahead east on agreement started tom satisfied with having made confession not sorry to have locus poenitentiae not to be deprived altogether of use of old faithful friend boy went on a usual taking sentence in turn crib being handed to one whose turn be to construe of course tom must object to a be not simply lying there to be appealed to in case sentence must prove too hard altogether for construer must be owned that gower east did not make very tremendous exertion to conquer sentence before having recourse to help tom however with most heroic virtue gallantry rushed into sentence searching in high minded manner for nominative verb turning over dictionary frantically for first hard word stopped in meantime gower who be bent on getting to five must peep quietly into crib then suggest think be meaning think must take way brown a tom did see way to not profiting by suggestion lesson went on about a quickly a usual gower be able to start for five court within five minute of half hour when tom east be left face to face looked at one for minute tom puzzled east chock full of fun then burst into roar of laughter well tom said east recovering see objection to new way be about a good a old one think besides advantage give one of feeling virtuous looking down on one neighbour tom shoved hand into back hair ai so sure said two fellow carried off leg think really tried one sentence fairly be sure remember what doctor said to yes will swear must make out one of sentence to day ever must really remember said east speaking slowly impressively to have come across one latin greek sentence half must go construe by light of nature whereby be sure providence intended crib to be used thing to find out said tom meditatively be how long one ought to grind at sentence without looking at crib now think if one fairly look out word one know then ca hit be enough to be sure tommy said east demurely with merry twinkle in eye new doctrine too old fellow added when one come to think of be cutting at root of school morality will take away mutual help brotherly love in vulgar tongue giving construes hold to be one of highest virtue for how can distinguish between getting construe from boy using crib hang tom if be going to deprive school fellow of chance of exercising christian benevolence being good samaritan will cut concern wish must joke about harry be hard enough to see one way precious sight harder than thought last night suppose there be use abuse of one will get straight enough somehow ca make out anyhow that one have right to use old vulgus book copy book hullo more heresy how fast fellow go down hill when once get head before leg listen to tom not use old vulgus book why goth ai to take benefit of wisdom admire use work of past generation not use old copy book why might a well say ought to pull down westminster abbey put up go to meeting shop with churchwarden window never read shakespere only sheridan knowles think of work labour that predecessor have bestowed on very book be to make work of value say harry please chaff be really serious then be not duty to consult pleasure of others rather than own above of master fancy then difference to in looking over vulgus have be carefully touched retouched by others must bring sort of dreamy pleasure a if 'd met thought expression of somewhere before be born perhaps that of cutting up making picture frame round false quantity other monstrosity why tom must be so cruel a never to let old momus hum over o genus humanum again then look up doubtingly through spectacle end by smiling giving three extra mark for just for old sake sake suppose well said tom getting up in something a like huff a be capable of be deuced hard that when fellow really trying to do what ought best friend will hing chaff try to put down stuck book under arm hat on head preparatory to rushing out into quadrangle to testify with own soul of faithlessness of friendship now be as tom said east catching hold of know well enough by time bark worse than bite ca expect to ride new crotchet without anybody trying to stick nettle under tail make kick off especially a will have to go on foot still now sit down let go over again will be a serious a judge then tom sat down on table waxed eloquent about righteousness advantage of new plan a be wont whenever took up anything going into a if life depended upon sparing abuse must think of of opposite method denounced a ungentlemanly cowardly mean lying one know what besides very cool of tom a east thought did say seeing a how only came out of egypt last night at bed time well tom said at last see when came to school there be none of sort of notion may be right dare say be only what one have always felt about master be that be fair trial of skill last between like match at football battle be natural enemy in school be fact have got to learn so much latin greek do so many verse have got to see that do if can slip collar do so much le without getting caught be one to if can get more out of catch shirking be one to fair in war lying if run luck against theirs go into school without looking at lesson get called up why be snob sneak tell master have learnt be got to find out whether have not what be paid for if call up get floored make write out in greek english very good be caught grumble grant if go snivel to tell have really tried to learn found so hard without translation say have have toothache humbug of kind be snob school morality be served too tom for matter of that five year be clear fair mistake about understand understand know what be to come to with other tom looked at pleased little puzzled have never heard east speak mind seriously before must help feeling how completely have hit own theory practice up to time thank old fellow said be good old brick to be serious not put out with said more than meant dare say only see know be right gower rest do will hold on must a be new up hill game see one must hit hard hold on tight at first very good said east hold on hit away only hit under line must bring over harry sha be comfortable now allow have said have always be honourable enemy with master found state of war when came went into of course only think thing be altered good deal feel a used to master seem to to treat one quite differently yes perhaps do said east there be new set see mostly who feel sure of yet want to fight till know ground think be only said tom then doctor doe treat one so openly like gentleman a if one be working with well so doe said east be splendid fellow when get into sixth will act accordingly only know have nothing to do with lesson now except examining say though looking at watch be just quarter come along a walked out got message to say that arthur be just starting must like to say good bye so went down to private entrance of school house found open carriage with arthur propped up with pillow in looking already better tom thought jumped up on to step to shake hand with tom mumbled thanks for present have found in study looked round anxiously for arthur mother east who have fallen back into usual humour looked quaintly at arthur said so have be at again through hot headed convert of yours there be be making life burthen to morning about using crib will get floored to certainty at second lesson if be called up arthur blushed looked down tom struck in oh be all right be converted already always come through mud after grumbling sputtering clock struck have to go off to school wishing arthur pleasant holiday tom lingering behind moment to send thanks love to arthur mother tom renewed discussion after second lesson succeeded so far a to get east to promise to give new plan fair trial encouraged by success in evening when be sitting alone in large study where east lived now almost vice arthur on leave after examining new fishing rod pronounced to be genuine article play enough to throw midge tied on single hair against wind strength enough to hold grampus naturally began talking about arthur tom who be still bubbling over with last night scene thought of last week wanting to clinch fix whole in own mind must never do without first going through process of belabouring somebody else with suddenly rushed into subject of arthur illness what have said about death east have given desired opening after serio comic grumble that life be worth having now be tied to young beggar who be always 'raising standard that east be like prophet donkey who be obliged to struggle on after donkey man who went after prophet that have none of pleasure of starting new crotchet did half understand have to take kick carry luggage a if have fun threw leg up on to sofa put hand behind head said well after be most wonderful little fellow ever came across there ai such meek humble boy in school hanged if think now really tom that belief much worse fellow than that think have more influence in house than dot bowles who came last quarter ai ten yet turn round little finger old boy there be mistake about east nodded at tom sagaciously now never thought tom so shutting eye hardening heart went straight at repeating that arthur have said a near a must remember in very word have thought life seemed to ooze out of a went on several time felt inclined to stop give up change subject somehow be borne on have necessity upon to speak out did so at end looked at east with anxiety be delighted to see that young gentleman be thoughtful attentive fact be that in stage of inner life at tom have lately arrived intimacy with friendship for east must not have lasted if have not made aware of sharer in thought be beginning to exercise indeed must friendship have lasted if east have shown no sympathy with thought so that be great relief to have unbosomed to have found that friend must listen tom have always have sort of instinct that east levity be only skin deep instinct be true one east have want of reverence for anything felt to be real be one of nature burst into what be generally called recklessness impiety moment feel that anything be being poured upon for good doe not come home to inborn sense of right appeal to anything like self interest in daring honest by nature outspoken to extent alarmed respectability with constant fund of animal health spirit did not feel bound to curb in way have gained for with steady part of school including a well who wished to appear steady a who really be so character of boy whom must be dangerous to be intimate with while own hatred of everything cruel underhand false hearty respect for what must see to be good true kept off rest tom besides being very like east in many point of character have largely developed in composition capacity for taking weakest side be not putting strongly enough be necessity with must help more than must eating drinking must never play on strongest side with heart at football cricket be sure to make friend with boy who be unpopular down on luck now though east be not what be generally called unpopular tom felt more more day a character developed that stood alone did not make friend among contemporary therefore sought out tom be much more popular for power of detecting humbug be much le acute instinct be much more sociable be at period of life too largely given to taking people for what gave out to be singleness of heart fearlessness honesty be just what east appreciated thus two have be drawn into greater intimacy intimacy have not be interrupted by tom guardianship of arthur east have often a have be said joined in reading bible discussion have almost always turned upon character of men woman of whom read not become personal to in fact two have shrunk from personal religious discussion not knowing how might end fearful of risking friendship very dear to felt somehow without quite knowing why must never be same tenfold stronger sapped at foundation after communing together what bother explaining be wish must get on without ca however will find if have found out already that time come in human friendship when must go down into depth of lay bare what be there to friend wait in fear for answer few moment may do may be most likely will be a be english boy that never do once done must be if friendship be to be worth name must find what be there at very root bottom of one heart if be at once there nothing on earth can at least ought to sunder east have remained lying down until tom finished speaking a if fearing to interrupt now sat up at table leant head on one hand taking up pencil with other working little hole with in table cover after bit looked up stopped pencil said thank very much old fellow there be other boy in house must have done for arthur can see well enough went on after pause best big fellow look on with suspicion think be devil may care reckless young scamp so be eleven hour out of twelve not twelfth then of contemporary worth knowing follow suit of course be very good friend at game not soul of arthur ever tried to break through crust see whether there be anything at bottom of then bad one wo stand know that think be half fancy harry not bit of said east bitterly pegging away with pencil see plain enough bless think everybody a straightforward kind hearted a be well what be reason of there must be reason can play game a well a one sing best song be best company in house fancy be not liked harry be fancy only wish be tom know must be popular enough with bad one wo have good one wo have why not persisted tom drink swear get out at night never bully cheat at lesson if only showed liked 'd have best fellow in house running after not said east then with effort went on will tell what be never stop sacrament can see from doctor downwards how tell against yes have seen that said tom have be very sorry for arthur have talked about have often thought of speaking to be so hard to begin on such subject be very glad have opened now why have never be confirmed said east not be confirmed said tom in astonishment never thought of why be confirmed with rest of nearly three year ago always thought 'd be confirmed at home answered east sorrowfully see be how happened last confirmation be soon after arthur came be so taken up with hardly saw of well when doctor sent round for about be living mostly with green set know sort went in

two took way together up hillmorton road of course found master house locked up servant away in close about time doubt footing away on grass with extreme delight to in utter oblivion of unfortunate bachelor master whose one enjoyment in shape of meal be dish of tea a grandmother called in evening phrase be apt in case for always poured out into saucer before drinking great be good man horror at finding shut out of own house have be alone must have treated a matter of course must have strolled contentedly up down gravel walk until one came home be hurt at stain on character of host especially a guest be pupil however guest seemed to think great joke presently a poked about round house mounted wall from must reach passage window window a turned out be not bolted so in minute tom be in house down at front door opened from inside master chuckled grimly at burglarious entry insisted on leaving hall door two of front window open to frighten truant on return then two set about foraging for tea in operation master be much at fault having faintest possible idea of where to find anything being moreover wondrously short sighted tom by sort of instinct knew right cupboard in kitchen pantry soon managed to place on snuggery table better material for meal than have appeared there probably during reign of tutor who be then there initiated amongst other thing into excellence of mysterious condiment dripping cake cake be newly baked rich flaky tom have found reposing in cook private cupboard awaiting return a warning to finished to last crumb kettle sang away merrily on hob of snuggery for notwithstanding time of year lighted fire throwing window wide open at same time heap of book paper be pushed away to other end of table great solitary engraving of king college chapel over mantelpiece looked le stiff than usual a settled down in twilight to serious drinking of tea after talk on match other indifferent subject conversation came naturally back to tom approaching departure over began again to make moan well will miss quite a much a will miss said master be nestor of school now be not yes ever since east left answered tom by bye have heard from yes have letter in february just before started for india to join regiment will make capital officer aye wo said tom brightening fellow must handle boy better suppose soldier be very like boy will never tell to go where wo go mistake about braver fellow never walked year in sixth will have taught good deal will be useful to now so will said tom staring into fire poor dear harry went on how well remember day be put out of twenty how rose to situation burnt cigar case gave away pistol pondered on constitutional authority of sixth new duty to doctor fifth form fag aye fellow ever acted up to better though be always people man for fag against constituted authority must help that know be sure doctor must have liked said tom looking up inquiringly doctor see good in one appreciates said master dogmatically hope east will get good colonel wo do if ca respect above how long took even here to learn lesson of obeying well wish be alongside of said tom if ca be at rugby want to be at work in world not dawdling away three year at oxford what do mean by 'at work in world ' said master pausing with lip close to saucerful of tea peering at tom over well mean real work one profession one will have really to do make one living by want to be doing real good feeling be not only at play in world answered tom rather puzzled to find out what really did mean be mixing up two very different thing in head think brown said master putting down empty saucer ought to get clear about talk of 'working to get living ' 'doing real good in world ' in same breath now may be getting very good living in profession yet doing good at in world contrary at same time keep latter before a only object will be right whether make living not if dwell on other will very likely drop into mere money making let world take care of for good evil be in hurry about finding work in world for be not old enough to judge for yet just look about in place find in try to make thing little better honester there will find plenty to keep hand in at oxford wherever else go be led away to think part of world important unimportant corner of world be important man know whether part be most so man may do honest work in own corner then good man went on to talk wisely to tom of sort of work might take up a undergraduate warned of prevalent university sin explained to many great difference between university school life till twilight changed into darkness heard truant servant stealing in by back entrance wonder where arthur can be said tom at last looking at watch why be nearly half past nine already oh be

very great wise good man a regarded own position in school of be little proud tom have idea of giving one credit for truth to tell be very self conceited young gentleman on subject be wont to boast that have fought own way fairly up school have never made up to be taken up by big fellow master that be now quite different place from what be when first came indeed though did actually boast of yet

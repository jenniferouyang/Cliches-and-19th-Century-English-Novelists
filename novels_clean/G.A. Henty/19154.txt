business matter connected with estate of be now mistress orangery so called from large conservatory built by mr wingfield grandfather be family seat broad land around be tilled by upward of two hundred slave there be in addition three other property lying in different part of state here vincent with two sister one older one younger than have be born when be eight year old major mr wingfield have gone over with child to england have left vincent there for four year at school holiday being spent at house of father brother country gentleman in sussex then have be sent for unexpectedly father saying that health be not good that must like son to be with year later father died vincent be now nearly sixteen year old must upon coming of age assume rein of power at orangery of mother however must be actual mistress a long a lived four year vincent have passed in english school have done much to render institution of slavery repugnant to father have have many serious talk with during last year of life have shown that there be good deal to be said upon side of subject there be good plantation bad plantation vincent there be many more good one than bad one there be brute to be found everywhere there be bad master in southern state just a there be bad landlord in european country even from self interest alone planter have greater reason for caring for health comfort of slave than english farmer have in caring for comfort of laborer slave be valuable property if be over worked badly cared for decrease in value whereas if laborer fall sick be unable to do work farmer have simply to hire hand be a much interest of planter to keep slave in good health spirit a be for farmer to feed attend to horse properly of two consider that slave with fairly kind master be to full a happy a ordinary english laborer certainly doe not work so hard if be ill be carefully attended to be well fed have care anxiety when old past work have fear of workhouse staring in face at same time be quite ready to grant that there be horrible abuse possible under law connected with selling of slave be to say breaking up of family selling separately be horrible abominable if estate be sold together with slave upon there must be no more hardship in matter than there be when estate change hand in england laborer upon work for new master instead of old be to liberate slave on estate to morrow to send north think that must be in way benefited by change must still have to work for living a do now being naturally indolent shiftless must probably fare much worse against selling of family separately use of lash set face strongly at same time boy sentiment may be on subject must keep mouth closed a to owing to attempt of northern abolitionist who have come down here stirring up slave to discontent be not advisable indeed be absolutely dangerous to speak against slavery in southern state institution be here must make best can of people here be very sore at foul slander have be published by northern writer there have be many atrocity perpetrated undoubtedly by brute who must have be brute wherever have be born to collect series of such atrocity to string together into story to hold up a mr beecher stowe have a picture of slave life in southern state be a gross libel a if anyone be to make collection of wife beating assault of drunken english ruffian to publish a picture of average life of english people such libel a have done more to embitter two section of america against other than anything else therefore vincent advice to be be always kind to slave not over indulgent because be very like child indulgence spoil be at same time firm kind to with other people avoid entering into discussion expressing opinion with regard to slavery can do good can do much harm take thing a find make best of trust that time may come when slavery will be abolished hope for sake of slave that when be done will be done gradually thoughtfully for otherwise must inflict terrible hardship suffering upon a well a upon master there be many such conversation between father son for feeling on subject ran very high in southern state former felt that be of utmost importance to son that must avoid taking strong line in matter among old family of virginia there be indeed far le feeling on subject than in of other state knowing good feeling almost universally existed between slave gentry of virginia regarded with contempt calumny of be subject secure in affection of slave affection be afterward abundantly proved during course of war scarcely saw ugly side of question worst master be smallest one man who owned six slave be far more apt to extort utmost possible work from than planter who owned three four hundred worst master of be who having made little money in trade speculation in town purchased dozen slave small piece of land tried to set up a gentry in virginia life of large planter be almost patriarchal one indoor slave be treated with extreme indulgence be permitted far higher degree of freedom of remark familiarity than be case with servant in english household have be nurse companion of owner when child have grown up with regarded be regarded by a almost part of family there be of course connection between planter field hand also have for most part be born on estate have a child be taught to look up to white master mistress to receive many little kindness at hand have be cared for in sickness knew that must be provided for in old age have little allotment must raise fruit vegetable fowl for own use for sale in leisure time fear of loss of employment pressure of want ever present to english laborer have never fallen upon climate be lovely one work far le severe than of men forced to toil in cold wet winter summer institution of slavery assuredly be capable of terrible abuse be marked in many instance by abominable cruelty oppression taken in negro on well ordered estate under kind master be probably happier class of people than laborer upon estate in europe jonas pearson have be overseer in time of major wingfield authority have at time be comparatively small for major personally supervised whole working of estate be greatly liked by slave whose chief affection be however naturally bestowed upon mistress who have from childhood be brought up in midst major wingfield have not liked overseer have never ground to justify making change jonas who be northern man be always active energetic major wingfield order be strictly punctually carried out although disliked man employer acknowledged to be excellent servant after major death jonas pearson have naturally obtained greatly increased power authority mr wingfield have great confidence in account be always clear precise although profit of estate be not quite so large a have be in husband lifetime be always satisfactorily explained by fall in price by part of crop being affected by weather flattered that managed estate at time rode over made suggestion issued order be only in fit start although jonas came up two three time week to house nominally to receive order managed so adroitly that while believed that everything be done by direction in reality only followed out suggestion in first place came from be aware however that there be le content happiness on estate than there have be in old time complaint have reached from time to time of overwork harsh treatment upon inquiring into matter jonas have always such plausible reason to give that be convinced be in right that fault be among slave who tried to take advantage of fact that have longer master eye upon accordingly tried to shirk work to throw discredit upon man who looked after interest of mistress so gradually mr wingfield left management of affair more more in hand of jonas relied more implicitly upon overseer spared pain to gain good will of vincent when latter declared that horse rode have not sufficient life spirit for jonas have set inquiry on foot have selected for horse for speed bottom have superior in state one of mr wingfield acquaintance however upon hearing that have purchased animal told that be notorious for vicious temper spoke angrily to jonas on subject in presence of vincent overseer excused by saying that have certainly heard that horse be high spirited needed good rider that must not have thought of selecting have not known that mr vincent be first class rider must not care to have horse that child must manage praise be not undeserved gentleman of virginia be celebrated a good rider major wingfield cavalry man have be anxious that vincent must maintain credit of english blood have placed on pony a soon a be able to sit on one pony have be kept for use during holiday at uncle in england upon return vincent have except during hour spent with father almost lived on horseback riding about estate paying visit to house of other planter for hour more everyday exercised father horse in paddock near house major being wheeled down in easy chair superintending riding a horse have little to do be full of spirit vincent power be often taxed to utmost have many fall soil be light have learned knack of falling easily from constant practice be able at age of fourteen to stick on firmly even without saddle be absolutely fearless a to animal mounted in two year have followed have kept up riding morning after breakfast rode to richmond six mile distant put up horse at stable there spent three hour at school rest of day be own must often ride off with of schoolfellow who have also come in from distance not return home till late in evening vincent took after english father rather than virginia mother in appearance character be likely to become a tall brawny man a former have be when first won love of virginia heiress be full of life energy in respect offered strong contrast to most of schoolfellow of same age for although splendid rider keen sportsman planter of virginia be in other respect inclined to indolence result partly of climate partly of being waited upon from childhood by attendant ready to carry out wish have father cheerful disposition good temper together with decisive manner so frequently acquired by service in army at same time have something of warmth enthusiasm of virginia character good rider a be be somewhat surprised at horse overseer have selected for be certainly splendid animal with great bone power there be mistaking expression of turned back eye ear lay almost flat on head when anyone approached be splendid animal doubt jonas said first time inspected certainly look a if have beast of temper fear what be told mother about be exaggeration for mr markham told to day when rode down there with son said have bought wildfire that friend of have have once only kept for week for be most vicious brute ever saw be sorry have bought now sir jonas said of course must not have done so if have heard thing before be told be one of finest horse in country only little tricky a price be so reasonable thought great bargain see now be wrong that must be right for to mount so think have best send in on saturday to market let go for what will fetch see sir if have be three four year older must have be different naturally at age like to ride horse a sha give up without trial vincent said shortly be about finest horse ever saw if have be for temper must have be cheap at five time sum gave for have ridden good many bad tempered horse for friend during last year worst of must get off well sir of course will do a please jonas said please to remember if harm come of strongly advised not to have anything to do with did best to dissuade from trying vincent nodded carelessly then turned to black groom jake get out that cavalry saddle of father with high cantle pommel roll for knee be like armchair if one ca stick on on one deserves to be thrown while groom be putting on saddle vincent stood patting horse head talking to then taking rein led down into inclosure want whip said a jake offered one have got spur likely enough horse temper may have be spoiled by knocking about with whip will try what kindness will do with first like look massa vincent debble of ho dat think have nice temper jake people learn to control temper see why horse must at rate will have try at look a if appreciates being patted spoken to already of course if treat horse like savage will become savage now stand out of way gathering rein together placing one hand upon pommel vincent sprang into saddle without touching stirrup then sat for minute two patting horse neck wildfire apparently disgusted at having allowed to be mounted so suddenly lashed out viciously two three time then refused to move for hour vincent tried effect of patient coaxing in vain well if wo do by fair mean must by foul vincent said at last sharply pricked with spur wildfire sprang into air then began desperate series of effort to rid of rider rearing kicking in such quick succession that seemed time in air finding after while that effort be unavailing subsided at last into sulky immovability again vincent tried coaxing patting a success attended effort again applied spur sharply time horse responded by springing forward like arrow from bow dashed at top of speed across inclosure cleared high fence without effort then set off across country have attempted to take bit in teeth with sharp jerk a drove spur in vincent have defeated intention now did not attempt to check guide keeping light hand on rein let go own course vincent knew that so long a horse be going full speed must attempt trick to unseat therefore sat easily in saddle for six mile wildfire continued course clearing obstacle without abatement to speed delighting rider with power jumping quality occasionally only when course be taking must have led to obstacle impossible for best jumper to surmount vincent attempted to put slightest pressure upon one rein other so a to direct to easier point at end of six mile horse speed began slightly to abate vincent abstaining from use of spur pressed with knee spoke to cheerfully urging forward now from time to time bent forward patted for six mile kept going at speed almost a great a at have started then allowed gradually to slacken pace until at last first gallop then trot ceased broke into walk have have fine gallop old fellow vincent said patting so have there be be nothing for to lose temper about next road come upon will turn face homeward dozen lesson like then doubt will be good friend journey home be performed at walk vincent talking greater part of time to horse took good deal more than six lesson before wildfire must start without preliminary struggle with master in end kindness patience conquered vincent often visited horse in stable taking with apple piece of sugar spent time there talking to petting never carried whip never used spur except in forcing to make first start have horse be naturally ill tempered vincent must probably have failed a happened afterward to learn first owner have be hot tempered passionate young planter who instead of being patient with have beat about head so rendered restive bad tempered have vincent not laid aside whip before mounting for first time probably must never have effected cure be fact that animal have longer fear of old enemy whip a much a general course of kindness good treatment have effected change in behavior be just when vincent have established good understanding between wildfire that have altercation with overseer whom found about to flog young negro dan pearson have sent lad hour before on message to slave at work at other end of estate have found sitting on ground watching tree in have discovered 'possum dan deserved punishment be undoubted have at present regular employment upon estate jake father be head of stable dan have made useful in odd job about horse expected to become one of regular stable hand overseer be of opinion that there be already more negro in stable than must find employment have urged upon mr wingfield that one of hand there boy dan must be sent out to field however refused know be quite right jonas in what say there be always four hand in stable in father time there always have be up to now though know have easy time of certainly must not like to send of out into field a to dan will think about when father be about age used to lead pony when first took to riding when there be vacancy dan must come into stable must not think of sending out a field hand in first place for father sake still more for of vincent dan used to be told off to see vincent did not get into mischief when be little boy have run message be special boy since came back vincent wanted to have a regular house servant must have broken old sam heart if after being father boy husband have taken place a vincent so dan have remained in stable regarding vincent a special master carrying message for to friend doing odd job might require spending small portion of time in sleep thus be object of special dislike to overseer in first place because have not succeeded in having way with regard to in second because be useless hand overseer loved to get a much work a possible out of everyone on estate message have be somewhat important one a wanted slave for work be urgently required lost temper must not have done act must certainly bring into collision with vincent be well aware that lad did not really like that effort to gain good will have failed have foreseen that sooner later there must be struggle for power between however relied upon influence with mr wingfield upon fact that be life owner of orangery believed that must be able to maintain position even when vincent came of age vincent on side objected to overseer treatment of hand of heard good deal from dan have already remonstrated with mother on subject however gained nothing by mr wingfield have replied that be too young to interfere in such matter that english idea must not do in virginia that naturally slave be set against overseer now pearson have longer master to support be obliged to be more severe than before to enforce obedience at same time vexed at heart that there must be severity on orangery estate where best relation have always prevailed between master slave have spoken to jonas on subject have given same answer that have given son slave will work for master mr wingfield in way will not for stranger set against if be not severe with must get work at out of of course if wish can do a like in case must have overseer can not see fine estate going to ruin believe of abolition fellow have be getting among doing mischief that there be bad spirit growing up among can assure be a lenient with a be possible to be if wo work must make so long a stay here so overseer have have way knew that man be good servant that estate be kept in excellent order after severity of have heard complaint be by mean excessive be not to be expected that northern overseer must rule entirely by kindness a owner of estate must do change must be most inconvenient to must have difficulty in suiting so well time besides man have be with sixteen year be a believed devoted to interest therefore turned deaf ear to vincent remonstrance have always be somewhat opposed to being left in england at school urging that must learn idea there must clash with of people among whom life be to be spent still considered that view have be justified by result overseer be first to give version of story about dan conduct for on going to house vincent found sister rosa annie in garden having just returned from two day visit to friend in richmond stayed chatting with listening to news for hour in meantime jonas have gone in seen mr wingfield told story think mr wingfield said when have finished that will be better for to leave be quite evident that can have authority over hand if son be to interfere when be about to punish slave for act of gross disobedience neglect found that tobacco required turning now will not be done afternoon owing to order not being carried out tobacco will not improbably be injured in quality position be difficult enough a be if slave see that instead of being supported be thwarted by son authority be gone altogether overseer can carry on work properly under such circumstance will see to matter jonas mr wingfield said decidedly be assured that have entire support will see that son doe not again interfere when therefore vincent entered house began complaint found cut short have heard story already vincent dan acted in gross disobedience thoroughly deserved punishment jonas be about to give work of estate can not be carried on if such conduct be to be tolerated once for will permit interference on part with jonas if have complaint to make come to make be not to interfere in way with overseer a for dan have directed jonas that next time give cause for complaint be to go into field vincent stood silent for minute then said quietly very well mother of course can do a like at rate will not keep mouth shut when see that fellow ill treating slave such thing be never done in father time wo see done now said other day must get nomination to west point a soon a be sixteen must be glad if must do so by time have gone through school will perhaps see have be right about jonas so saying turned left room again joined sister in drawing room have just told mother will go to west point girl said father said more than once that thought be best education must get in america thought have made up mind that must rather stop at home vincent so have so must have done mother differ in opinion that fellow jonas be going to flog dan stopped morning mother take part against know like way go on with slave be not half so merry happy a used to be like will have one of running away next will be nice thing on what used to be considered one of happiest plantation in virginia ca make mother out must have thought that must have be last person in world to have allowed slave to be harshly treated be sure like jonas more than do vincent see have to depend upon so much think can like ca have everything like in man know think be very good overseer suppose must get vincent said thought that there must not be much difficulty about getting overseer there might be difficulty in getting one must rely on so thoroughly rosa said see great deal must be left to jonas have be here good many year now have learned to trust must be long time before have same confidence in stranger may be sure that must have fault though perhaps not same a of jonas think make allowance enough for mamma vincent quite agree with a to jonas think mamma can like harshness to slave more than do everyone say what difficulty be to get really trustworthy capable overseer of course be harder when there be master to look after well in few year will be able to look after overseer vincent said might do so of course vincent if liked unless change good deal think supervision must amount to very much when be not at school be always on horseback away see little enough of think be likely for long time yet to give up most of time to looking after estate perhaps be right vincent said after thinking for minute think must settle down too give most of time to estate if be responsible for dare say mother be in difficulty over must not have spoken a did will go in tell so vincent found mother sitting a have left although have sided with jonas be against will for be grievous to to hear complaint of treatment of slave at orangery still a rosa have said felt confidence in overseer believed that be excellent servant be conscious that knew nothing of business that must therefore give entire confidence to manager greatly disliked strictness of jonas if a said slave must not obey without strictness must do a thought best think spoke too hastily mother vincent said a entered be sure that must not wish slave to be ill treated more than must dare say jonas mean for best feel sure that doe vincent man in position can not make obeyed like master wish must be otherwise will speak to on subject will not do to interfere with too much good overseer be not easy to get slave be always ready to take advantage of leniency easy master make bad work easy overseer must mean ruin to estate be convinced that jonas have interest at heart will tell particularly wish that will devise other sort of punishment such a depriving men who wo work of of privilege instead of using lash thank mother at rate might be told that lash be never to be used without first appealing to will see about vincent talk over with with vincent be satisfied chapter ii buying slave mr wingfield did talk matter over with overseer thing went on in consequence more smoothly vincent however adhered to wish be arranged that a soon a must get nomination must go to west point be to american army what sandhurst be to england before must be done however great political agitation sprang up slave state be greatly excited over prospect of republican president being chosen for republican be to great extent identified with abolition movement public feeling have for time run high became intensified a time approached for election of new president threat that if democrat be beaten republican elected slave state must secede from union be freely indulged in in virginia be one of most northern of slave state opinion be somewhat divided there being strong minority against extreme measure being taken among vincent friend however who be for most part son of planter democratic feeling be very strongly in ascendant sympathy be wholly with southern state that have right to secede be assumed by a being unquestionable in point of fact there be great deal to be said on side state first entered union in considered to be separate sovereign state possessing power authority to manage own affair forming only federation in order to construct central power so to operate with more effect against mother country two year later constitution of united state be framed state giving up certain portion of authority reserving own self government right be not specifically resigned mention be made in constitution of right of state to secede from union while who insisted that state have right to secede if chose to do so declared that right be reserved opponent affirmed that case must never have be contemplated thus question of absolute right have never be settled became purely one of force early in november became known that election of mr lincoln republican candidate be assured on th of month representative of south carolina met at charleston unanimously authorized holding of state convention to meet on third week in december announcement caused great excitement for be considered certain that convention must pas vote of secession thus bring debated question to issue although opinion in virginia be le unanimous than in more southern state be generally thought that must imitate example of south carolina on day following receipt of news vincent who have ridden over to plantation of several of friend to talk matter over be returning homeward when heard sound of heavy blow with whip loud curse moment later shrill scream in woman voice rose in air vincent checked horse mechanically with exclamation of anger knew too well what be going on beyond screen of shrub grew on other side of fence bordering road for moment hesitated then muttering what be use be about to touch horse with whip gallop on when shriek again rose louder more agonizing than before with cry of rage vincent leaped from horse threw rein over top of fence climbed over in moment burst way through shrubbery close by negro be being held by four others two having hold of wrist holding arm extended to full length while white lad two year vincent senior be showering blow with heavy whip upon slave back be already covered with weal blood be flowing from several place few yard distant black girl with baby in arm be kneeling on ground screaming for mercy for slave just a vincent burst through bush young fellow irritated at cry turned round delivered tremendous blow with whip on bare shoulder time cry came from lip slave who have stood immovable while punishment be being inflicted upon made desperate effort to break from men who held be unsuccessful before whip must again fall on woman shoulder vincent sprang forward seizing wrested from hand of striker with oath of fury surprise at sudden interruption young fellow turned upon vincent be coward blackguard andrew jackson vincent exclaimed white with anger be disgrace to virginia ruffian without word young planter mad with rage at interference rushed at vincent latter have learned use of fist at english school riding exercise have strengthened muscle a opponent rushed at met with blow from shoulder sent staggering back with blood streaming from lip again rushed forward heavy blow be exchanged then closed grappled for minute swayed to fro although much taller young planter be stronger than vincent at last came to ground with crash vincent uppermost jackson head a fell coming with such force against low stump that lay insensible contest have be so sudden furious that none have attempted to interfere indeed negro be so astonished that have not moved from moment when vincent made appearance upon scene lad rose to foot have better carry up to house throw water on said to negro then turned away a did so slave who have be flogged broke from others who have indeed loosened hold ran up to vincent threw on knee taking lad hand pressed to lip be afraid have done much good vincent said will be none better off for interference must help so saying made way through shrubbery cleared fence mounted rode homeward have be fool said to a rode along will be worse for poor beggar afterward still must not help wonder will there be row about much expect there will jackson stand well now must not do good with people round besides think jackson must like to go into court to complain of being thrashed by fellow head shorter than be blackguard like who give abolitionist right to hold up slave owner a being tyrant brute jackson be newcomer in virginia six year before estate of cedar a place be called formed part be put up for sale be very large one having be divided into several portion to suit buyer cedar have be purchased by jackson who having be very successful a storekeeper at charleston have decided upon giving up business leaving south carolina settling down a landowner in other state antecedent however be soon known at richmond old virginian family turned cold shoulder to newcomer have be man of pleasant manner must gradually have made way be evidently not gentleman habit of trade stuck to in very short time there be rumor that slave whom have bought with property found harsh cruel master in must have be sufficient to bring into disrepute in virginia where a rule slave be treated with great kindness indeed considered position to be infinitely superior to of poorer class of white andrew jackson have be for few month at school with vincent be unpopular there from rumor current a to treatment of slave on estate be known by nickname of slave driver have vincent be son of white trader small cultivator knew well enough that position must be very serious one that must have have to ride to border of state with speed must have be denounced at once a abolitionist must have be accused of stirring up slave to rebellion against master crime of most serious kind in southern state placed a be a heir of great estate worked by slave such cry must hardly be raised against might doubtless be fined admonished for interfering between master slave sympathy of better class in virginia must be entirely with vincent therefore be little concerned for doubted greatly whether interference have not done much more harm than good to slave wife for upon andrew jackson must vent fury rode direct to stable instead of alighting a usual at door dan who have be sitting in veranda waiting for ran down to stable a saw coming give horse to one of others dan want to speak to dan went on when have walked with short distance from stable suppose know of hand on jackson plantation dan grinned for although there be not supposed to be communication between slave on different estate be notorious that at night be in habit of slipping out of hut visiting other know ob dem marse vincent what want ob dem bery bad master marse jackson wust master hereabout vincent related what have happened to dan intense delight now dan went on be afraid that after interference will treat that poor fellow wife worse than before want to find out for what be going on at jackson know that can do anything however badly treat have be thinking that if ill treat very grossly will get together party of fifteen twenty of friend will go in body to jackson warn that if behaves with cruelty to slave will make so hot for that will have to leave state say that must do anything a must represent most of large estate round here think old jackson son must like being sent to coventry feeling be very strong at present against ill treatment of slave if trouble lead to war almost of will go into army like thought of possibility of trouble among hand when white be away will find out about for to night sah suspect dat dey will do nuffin to day andrew jackson too sick after dat knock against de tump keep quiet day two well dan go over to night find out about expect have better have left thing alone now have interfered will go on with mr wingfield be much displeased when vincent told at dinner of incident at jackson plantation even sister be shocked at interference between master slave will get into serious trouble with fanciful notion of yours mr wingfield said angrily know a well a do how easy be to get up cry against anyone a abolitionist how difficult to disprove accusation just at present when passion of man in south be inflamed to utmost such accusation will be most serious in present instance there doe not seem that there be shadow of excuse for conduct simply heard cry of slave being flogged deliberately leave road enter people plantation interfere without so far a can see least reason for doing so did not inquire what man offense be may for aught know have half murdered master simply see slave being flogged assault owner if jackson lay complaint against be quite probable that may have to leave state what on earth can have influenced to act in such mad brained way did not interfere to prevent flogging slave mother to prevent flogging slave wife be pure wanton brutality be not question of slavery one way other anyone have right to interfere to put stop to brutality if saw man brutally treating horse dog must certainly do so if be right to interfere to save dumb animal from brutal ill treatment surely must be justifiable to save woman in same case be not abolitionist be to say consider slave on properly managed estate like ours for instance be just a well off a be laborer on estate in europe must certainly like to see law passed to protect from ill treatment why in england there be law against cruelty to animal man who brutally flogged dog horse must get month imprisonment with hard labor consider disgrace to that man here may ill treat human being worse than might in england dumb animal know vincent mother said more quietly that object a much a do to ill treatment of slave that slave here a on well conducted plantation in virginia be well treated be not time for bringing in law carrying out reform be bad enough to have score of northerner doing best to stir up mischief between master slave without southern gentleman mixing up in matter have got to stand together a one people to protect state right from interference be just a much in favor of state right a anyone else mother if a seems likely present quarrel be to be fought out hope will do best for virginia a well a other fellow of own age just a protest against interference by northerner with law say that ought to amend law so a not to give shadow of excuse for interference be brute like jackson who afford material for libel like 'uncle tom cabin ' upon a people ca say that be bit sorry for having given that young jackson what deserved well hope there will be trouble come of mr wingfield said must think jackson must like exposure of doings must be caused by bringing matter into court if do may be quite sure that jury in richmond at present time must find against suppose that will do anything mother if must must suppose anything serious will come of anyway next morning vincent went down early to stable a approached dan came out to meet well dan what be news bery great bobbery ober at jackson last night massa vincent fust of crept round to de hut ob de field hand dey knew nuffin about one of dem go off get to hab talk with gal employed in de house who be in de habit of slipping out to see say when de young un war carried in de old man go on furious bring suit

into court keep ear open dan find out how be thinking of punishing that poor follow for interference on behalf after breakfast negro arrived with note for mr wingfield from mr jackson complaining of unwarrantable illegal interference by son on behalf of slave who be being very properly punished for gross misconduct of personal assault upon son writer said that be most reluctant to take legal proceeding against member of so highly respected family that be impossible that must submit to outrage a although mr wingfield have expressed disapproval of vincent conduct on evening before there be trace of feeling in reply to letter wrote in third person coldly acknowledging receipt of mr jackson letter saying that have heard from son of interference to put stop to one of brutal scene brought discredit upon southern state that considered have most rightly punished mr jackson jr for inhuman revolting conduct that be perfectly aware interference have be technically illegal that son be fully prepared to defend conduct if called upon to do so in court to pay fine might be inflicted for suffering to be carried away by righteous indignation ended by saying that a mr jackson be stranger in virginia be perhaps not aware that public sentiment of state be altogether opposed to such act of brutality a of son have be guilty what have be doing to fellow andrew jackson one of vincent friend young fellow two year older than said to few day later there be lot of talking over thing yesterday in richmond came up joined in something be said about abolitionist said that must like to see abolitionist in state strung up to tree be always pretty violent a know on present occasion went further than usual then went on to say that worst most dangerous abolitionist be not northern men southerner who be traitor to state said 'for example there be that young wingfield have be to england have come back with head filled with abolitionist notion that such opinion at present time be danger to state two three of took matter up a might guess told have better mind what be saying must be worse for harry furniss went so far a to tell that be liar that if did like that must have satisfaction in usual way master jackson did like muttered something slunk off what be matter between must not have said anything about vincent replied if jackson have chosen to hold tongue a chooses to go about attacking there be reason why must keep matter secret then related what have taken place young virginian gave low whistle say blame wingfield tell might have got into awful mess if jackson have chosen to take up know how hot feeling be at present be serious matter at time to interfere between master slave in southern state of course among feeling must be against jackson among poorer class of white who have be tremendously excited by speech in north here cry of abolitionist at present moment be like red rag to bull however understand now fellow enmity to none of ever liked when be at school with be evil tempered brute be afraid may have trouble with if go about talking a did to must soon get up feeling against of course must be nonsense to openly accuse member of old virginian family of being abolitionist must be easy enough to set pack of rough class of town against might get badly mauled if caught alone fellow be evidently coward must have taken up what furniss said coward who be revengeful be good deal more dangerous than open foe however will talk over with of others will see if ca stop andrew jackson mouth result of be that next day dozen of vincent friend wrote joint letter to andrew jackson saying that regarded statement respecting vincent a false calumnious that if repeated must jointly severally hold responsible if a result of such accusation harm happened to vincent must know where to look for originator of mischief punish accordingly must be more careful andrew father said a white with fury showed letter be who be preaching prudence other day warning against taking step must set county family against now see have be letting tongue run have drawn upon keep quiet for present son sort of thing may occur before long will get chance let matter sleep for present day two later when vincent went down to stable saw that dan have something to tell soon found out that wished to speak to alone what be news dan heard last night marse vincent dat old man jackson be going to sell dinah dat de wife ob de man dey flogged be going to sell vincent repeated indignantly what be going to do for to punish tony sah dar be law against dar selling hear dat dey be going to sell two oder boy so dat can not be said dat dey do on purpose to spite tony reckon sah dey calculate dat when dey sell wife tony get mad run away den when dey catch again dey flog pretty near to death folk always do dat with runaway slave one can say nuffin agin dem for dat be infamous shame that must be lawful to separate man wife vincent said however will see what can do manage to pas word to tony to keep up spirit not let drive to do anything rash tell will see that wife doe not get into bad hand suppose will sell baby too yes marse vincent natural baby will go wid de modder vincent watched list of advertisement of slave to be sold day two later saw notice to effect that dinah moore age twenty two with male baby at breast must be sold on following saturday mounted horse rode into richmond have not liked to speak to mother on subject for have not told of letter have written to jackson thought that might disapprove of interference in matter consequently went down to mr renfrew family solicitor mr renfrew said want money can lend want money solicitor said in surprise what on earth do want money for if want why ask mother for how much do want know exactly about eight hundred dollar must think though may be thousand want to buy slave want to buy slave repeated mr renfrew what on earth do want to buy slave for have more than want now at orangery be slave man jackson be going to sell next saturday on purpose to spite poor creature husband drive to desperation vincent then repeated whole story of circumstance have led up to sale be very abominable on part of jackson mr renfrew said interference be most imprudent young friend a see have done harm rather than good if be so quixotic a to become champion of ill treated slave in state work be pretty well cut out for know that sir vincent replied smiling can assure did not intend to enter upon such crusade see have wrongly rightly mixed up in want to repair mischief a say have caused only way can see be to buy negress baby see that will carry out object if do vincent will be separated just a much from husband if buy a if anyone else doe be at one plantation be at be ten mile apart hundred be equally separated quite see that mr renfrew at least will be kindly treated mind will be at rest on score perhaps day other jackson may put up for sale then can buy will be reunited at rate first step be to buy can let have money mother make very good allowance suppose spend lawyer interrupted well yes generally spend then see when come of age come in for outlying estate if die before get shot other accident befalls mr renfrew said go to sister however one must risk something for client so will lend money have better put somebody up to bid for for after what have happened jackson must probably not let go if knew that be going to be purchaser thank very much vincent said warmly will be great weight off mind with light heart rode back to orangery vincent said nothing during next two day to of friend a to course jackson be taking in selling tony wife for thought that if news got about one of friend who have heard circumstance might go down to auction make such demonstration that jackson must be obliged to withdraw dinah from sale in case must no doubt dispose of privately on saturday mounted horse rode into richmond telling dan to meet there at hour sale be announced went to yard where be to take place be somewhat quiet secluded place for although sale of slave be permitted by law in virginia at rate auction be conducted quietly with a little publicity a possible for although better class still regarded slavery a necessary institution be conscious that sale involving a did separation of family be indefensible more thoughtful must gladly have seen abolished law passed forbidding sale of negro save a part parcel of estate upon worked exception only being made in case of gross misconduct many of slave owner indeed forbade flogging upon estate punished refractory slave in first place by cutting off of privilege enjoyed in way of holiday if did not answer threatened to sell threat be in vast majority of case quite sufficient to insure good behavior for slave be well aware of difference between life in well managed establishment in virginia that in of other southern state handing horse to dan vincent joined knot of four five of acquaintance who have strolled in from mere curiosity there be thirty forty men in yard few of whom have come in for purpose of buying great majority have only attended for sake of passing idle hour slave have fallen in value for although in south professed confidence that law must never attempt by force of arm to prevent secession be felt that slave property must in future be more precarious for north must not improbably repeal law for arrest of fugitive slave consequently runaway who succeeded in crossing border must be lost to master upon other side of yard vincent saw andrew jackson talking to two three men who be stranger to who guessed be buyer from of more southern state there be in twelve lot to be disposed of of two three be hand who be no longer fit for field work who be bought at very low price by men who owned few acre of land who must utilize for odd job requiring little strength then there be stir of attention dinah moore took stand upon platform with baby in arm message dan have conveyed from vincent to husband have given hope though looked scared frightened a clasped babe to breast be not filled with such utter despair a must otherwise have be case auctioneer stated advantage of lot in same business like tone a if have be selling horse lot negro wench dinah age twenty two with male child strong well made a see gentleman fit for field work must be made useful hand about house said to be handy good tempered now gentleman what will say for desirable lot one of men standing by andrew jackson bid hundred dollar bid be raised to hundred fifty by rough looking fellow standing in front of platform for time bidding be confined to two rose until reached seven hundred fifty at point man near platform retired there be pause vincent felt uncomfortable have already be round to mr renfrew who have told that have deputed agent to buy until man near platform stopped have supposed that be solicitor agent now gentleman auctioneer said surely be not going to let desirable piece of property go for seven fifty must be cheap at double price have sold worse article for three thousand will go twenty five dollar tall man in homespun planter broad straw hat said quietly contest now recommenced by bid of twenty five dollar at time amount be raised to twelve hundred fifty dollar be enough for man standing by andrew jackson said may have at twelve fifty dear enough too a time go will anyone else make offer auctioneer asked there be response hammer fell what name nathaniel forster tall man said advancing to table counted out roll of note gave to auctioneer who handed to formal note certifying to having legally purchased dinah moore infant late property of andrew jackson esquire of cedar state of virginia purchaser have evidently made up mind beforehand to secure lot for handed parcel have be holding to dinah said briefly slip thing on lass poor girl who have before be simply attired in scantiest of petticoat retired to corner of yard speedily came forward again dressed in neat cotton gown there be several joking remark made by bystander dinah new master took notice of with motion of hand to to follow walked out of yard minute later vincent followed although have doubt that man be agent mr renfrew have employed did not feel thoroughly satisfied until saw enter lawyer office quickly followed have just entered private room of mr renfrew be right wingfield lawyer said see have settled business satisfactorily think have got fairly cheap bargain just wait minute will complete transaction dinah gave start a vincent entered with habitual self repression of slave stood quietly in corner to have withdrawn at other end of room lawyer be busy drawing up document touching bell ordered clerk to go across to mr rawlins justice of peace ask to step across road in minute mr rawlins entered want to witness deed of sale of slave mr renfrew said here be particular forster sell to vincent wingfield slave dinah moore male infant for sum of fourteen hundred dollar be party forster sign receipt man did so justice put signature a witness to transaction dropped into pocket fee of five dollar that lawyer handed to without word strolled out again there dinah mr renfrew said mr wingfield be now master girl ran forward fell on knee before vincent seized hand kissed sobbing out thanks a did so there will do dinah lawyer said seeing that vincent be confused by greeting think be lucky girl have made good exchange for orangery instead of cedar suppose will find mr wingfield very hard master what be going to do with be sure know vincent now went to door called in dan told to take dinah to orangery then mounting horse rode off home to prepare mother for reception of new purchase chapter iii aiding runaway well be extraordinary boy vincent mr wingfield said a son told story while sister burst into fit of laughter at idea of vincent owning female slave with baby why did not tell that wanted money instead of going to mr renfrew will tell be very angry with for letting have for purpose be not sure whether must let have mother if have refused have got afterward from mr renfrew must not have liked to bring home here that must have be fun annie said fancy vincent trouble with female slave on hand nowhere to put what must have done vincent suppose must have got home for somewhere vincent said quietly think there must have be difficulty about still be glad did have to do so one slave more le can make difference here not at mr wingfield said dare say chloe will find something for to do in way of washing such other light work that be fit for about house be not that be year since slave be brought into orangery never since can remember raise more than want ourselves when see child about wonder sometimes what on earth be to find for to do still be scandalous thing of man jackson selling girl to punish husband a say be foolish interference in matter brought about so know that can blame for doing what can to set matter straight still except that knowledge that be here will be well treated will be comfort to man see that will be much better off unless indeed jackson must try to sell also in case suppose will want to buy be afraid wo do that mother still somehow other in time may come together again see how can vincent however need not think of now at rate hope there will be further opportunity for mixing up in business have made two bitter enemy now although see that such people a can do harm be always well not to make enemy especially in time like when one can foresee exactly what may occur so dinah moore became inmate of orangery though girl have laughed at brother be very kind to when arrived with dan made much of of baby same night dan went over to cedar managed to have interview with tony to tell that wife have be bought by vincent joy of negro be extreme previous message have raised hope that vincent must succeed in getting bought by someone who must be kind to knew well that might nevertheless fall to lot of higher bidder be taken hundred of mile away that might never again get news of whereabouts have then suffered terrible anxiety day relief of learning vincent have bought that be now installed a house servant at orangery few mile away be quite overpowering for minute must only gasp out joy thankfulness must hope now that when better time came might be able to steal away night meet that day other though how must not see might be reunited jackson remained in ignorance that former slave be located so near to be for reason mr renfrew have instructed agent to buy in own name instead of of vincent jackson having idea of transfer have subsequently taken place took further interest in matter believing that have achieved object of torturing tony avenging upon humiliation that andrew have suffered at vincent hand have questioned slave have answered truly must have discovered fact for although tony said word to anyone of what have learned from dan fact that dinah be at orangery be speedily known among slave for doings at one plantation be soon conveyed to negro on others by occasional visit paid at night to other quarter to common rendezvous far removed from interruption occasionally tony dinah met dan must come up late in evening to house nod to dinah must be sufficient to send flying down garden to clump of shrub where must be waiting for at stolen meeting be perfectly happy for tony said word to of misery of life how be always put to hardest work beaten on smallest pretext how in fact life be made so unendurable that idea of running away taking to swamp be constantly present to a to making way north did not enter mind a possible slave did indeed at time succeed in traveling through northern state making way to canada be only possible by mean of organization known a underground railway association consisting of number of good people who devoted to purpose giving shelter to fugitive slave during day then passing on to next refuge during night for in northern state a well a southern negro unprovided with paper showing that be free man be liable to be arrested sent back to south prisoner large reward

up either transferring good into smaller craft to be sent up by river to richmond to be carried on by rail through town of petersburg leaving horse at house near river crossed james in boat to city point there be several vessel lying here for hour hung about wharf watching process of discharging by end of time have obtained view of captain have watched a gave order have at last come to conclusion a to must be most likely to suit purpose having made up mind waited until one have fixed upon came ashore be man of five thirty year old with pleasant face good natured smile first went into office on wharf hour later came out walked toward railway station vincent at once followed a overtook said want very much to speak to sir if must spare minute two certainly sailor said with surprise train for petersburg doe not go for half hour what can do for name be vincent wingfield father be english officer mother be owner of large estate near richmond be most anxious to get person in whom be interested on board ship know how to set about there be difficulty about that captain said smiling have only to go to office pay for passage to where want to go ca do vincent replied for unfortunately be against law for captain to take mean be negro captain asked stopping short in walk looking sharply at vincent yes be what mean vincent said be negro who have be brutally ill treated have run away from master must willingly give hundred pound to get safely away be very serious business in be meddling young sir sailor said putting aside consequence to yourself be asking to break law to run risk of confiscation of ship even if be willing to do what propose must be impossible for ship will be searched from end to end before hatch be closed official will be on board until discharge pilot after getting well beyond mouth of river yes know vincent replied plan be to take boat go out beyond sight of land then to put on board after have got well away that might be managed certainly captain said must be contrary to duty to do anything must risk property of employer if when be out at sea boat came alongside passenger came on board must be matter suppose young gentleman that must not interfere in such business run risk that certainly must run if detected unless be certain that be deserving case that man have committed sort of crime for must not receive on board ship fugitive from justice whether be black white be indeed deserving case vincent said earnestly poor fellow have misfortune of belonging to one of worst master in state have be cruelly flogged on many occasion be finally driven to run away by selling wife child brute sailor said how people can allow thing to be done be mystery to well lad under circumstance will agree to do what ask if boat come alongside when be so far away from land that can not be seen will take man to england thank very much indeed vincent said will be doing good action upon what day do sail will drop down on monday into hampton road will get up sail at daylight next morning will pas fortress monroe at about seven in morning will sail straight out how will know ship vincent asked there may be others starting just about same time sailor thought for moment when be four five mile out will hoist owner flag at fore masthead be red flag with white ball so will be able to make out considerable distance away must not be le than ten twelve mile out for pilot often doe not leave ship till be mile past fortress monroe official will not leave ship till doe will keep sharp lookout for can not lose time in waiting if come alongside will suppose that have met with interruption to plan thank very much sir unless something go wrong will be alongside on tuesday that be settled captain said must be off else will lose train by way when come alongside make sign that have met before be just a well that none of crew must know that be planned thing for if ever happen to put in here again might blab about be just a well not to give chance good by lad hope that will go well know be doing very risky thing for assisting runaway slave to escape be about a serious offense a can commit in part might shoot dozen men get off scot free if be caught aiding runaway to escape there be saying what might come of after taking leave of captain vincent recrossed river rode home have friend whose father estate bordered on james others on york river of have pleasure boat be obviously better to go down york river thence round to mouth of james at fortress monroe a traffic on york be comparatively small be improbable that must be noticed going down returning have at first thought of hiring fishing boat from of free negro who made living on river finally decided against for fact of boat being absent so long must attract owner attention in case suspicion arose that fugitive have escaped by water hiring of boat by one who have already befriended slave absence for so long time must be almost certain to cause suspicion to be directed toward therefore decided upon borrowing boat from friend next morning rode to plantation of father of harry furniss being in convenient position on pamunky one of branch of york river be using that sailboat of yours at present harry because if not wish must let have use of for week so with pleasure vincent fishing line net a well if like very seldom use boat do mean to keep here move higher up river where must be more handy for perhaps think must rather leave here furniss mile two extra to ride make difference suppose be in water yes at foot of boathouse stair there be padlock chain will give key so can go off whenever like without bothering to come up to house if just call in at stable a ride by one of boy will go down with take horse put up till come back again that will do capitally vincent replied be time since be on water seem to have fancy for change at present one be sick of riding into richmond hearing nothing politics talked of be alarmed if hear at time that boat have not come back at night for if tide wind be unfavorable at time might stop at cumberland for night have often have to do furniss said besides if took away for week suppose anyone must notice for one go down to boathouse unless to get boat ready for trip next day vincent rode over to friend plantation sending dan off hour beforehand to bale out boat get mast sail into from boathouse greater part of next two day be spent on water sometimes sailing sometimes fishing evening of second of day be that upon vincent have arranged to meet tony again hour after dark went down through garden to stable for be time fugitive be to meet for must not leave place of concealment until night fell after looking at horse giving instruction to negro in charge returned to shrubbery sending dan up to summon dinah went to bush where have before met tony negro came out a approached how be tony much better dan be massa have not be disturbed since saw thanks to dat to de good food to massa kind word be stronger better now ready to do massa think best well tony be glad to say that think have arranged plan by will be got safely out of country of course may fail there be hope of success have arranged for boat will take down river put on board ship bound for england black clapped hand in delight at news when get there will take ship out to canada a soon a learn from that be there what be address will give dinah paper of freedom send on to oh massa be too much tony said with tear running down cheek too much joy altogeder well hope will come right tony dinah will be here in minute two keep long for wish absence from house to be observed just now now listen to instruction do know plantation of mr furniss on pamunky near coal harbor sir can find out ca because ca see anyone ask question very well then must be here again to morrow night at same hour dan will meet here act a guide will presently bring provision for to morrow be sure be careful tony get back to hiding place a soon a can lie very quiet to morrow until be time to start must be terrible if be to be caught now just a have arranged for to get away on following afternoon vincent told mother that be going over evening to friend furniss a early start be to be made next morning intended to go down river a far a yorktown if not further that certainly must not be back for two day probably might be even longer new boating freak of yours vincent seems to occupy thought wonder how long will last suppose will last much longer mother vincent said with laugh anyhow will make jolly change for week one have got so sick of hearing nothing talked about secession that week without hearing word mentioned will do one lot of good be sure felt that if one have much more of one must be almost driven to take up northern side just for sake of change must disown vin annie said laughing must have nothing to say to must be cut by friend well see week sailing fishing will save from annie will be able to begin again with fresh stock of patience believe be only half in earnest in cause vincent mother said gravely be not indeed mother quite agree with what everyone say a to right of state of virginia if north must really try to force other southern state to remain with will be just a ready to do everything can a anyone else ca see good of always talking about think be very wrong to ill treat abuse who think other way in england in civil war people of town almost thought one way almost of county other even now opinion differ almost a widely a to be right hate to hear people always laying down law a if there must not possibly be two side to case a if everyone who differed from must be rascal traitor almost fellow know say that if come to fighting will go into state army must be quite willing if must really take fellow of age for soldier to enlist too be reason why one must not get sick of hearing nothing one subject talked of for week be nearly dark when vincent started for walk of ten mile for have decided not to take horse with a have mean of sending back stay for three day in friend stable must attract attention to fact of long absence after about three hour walking reached boathouse having seen one a passed through plantation took oar sail from boathouse placed in boat then sat down in stern to await coming of negro in hour arrived tony carrying bundle of clothes dan have by vincent order bought for in richmond while dan carried large basket of provision vincent gave exclamation of thankfulness a saw two figure appear for day having be sunday knew that good many men must be likely to join search party in hope of having share in reward offered for tony capture have felt very anxious day sit in bottom of boat tony do steer dan make such splashing with oar that must be heard mile away keep close in shore in shadow of tree le be noticed better at time of night taking scull vincent rowed quietly away have often be out on boating excursion with friend have learned to row fairly during last two day have diligently instructed dan after two long day work young negro have got over first difficulty be still clumsy awkward vincent did not exert knew have long night row before paddled quietly along with stream boat be good sized one when not under sail be generally rowed by two strong negro accustomed to work sometimes for hour at time vincent ceased rowing let boat drift along quietly there be hurry for have day two night to get down to mouth of river distance of seventy mile out to sea far enough to intercept vessel at four o'clock arrived at cumberland where pamunky mattapony river unite form york river here be in tidal water a tide though not strong be flowing up vincent tied boat to branch of tree lay down in bottom for hour sleep telling dan to wake when tide turned if heard noise day have broken when boat drifted round dan aroused boat be rowed off to middle of river a there must be no longer attempt at concealment dan now took bow oar rowed until light breeze sprang up vincent then put up mast having hoisted sail took place at helm while dan went forward into bow passed several fishing boat smoke be seen curling up from hut in clearing scattered here there along shore sun have now risen heat be pleasant after damp night air although breeze be light boat made fair way with tide when ebb ceased at about ten o'clock mouth of river be few mile away mast be lowered sail stowed boat be then rowed into little creek tied up to bush basket of provision be opened hearty meal enjoyed tony being now permitted for first time to sit up in boat after meal vincent dan lay down for long sleep while tony who have hour during night kept watch at four in afternoon tide again slackened a soon a have fairly turned pushed out from creek again set sail in three hour be at mouth of river short distance out saw several fishing boat dropping anchor short distance away from lowered sail taking fishing line from locker of boat set to to fish a soon a be quite dark anchor be hauled up vincent dan took oar wind having now completely dropped for time rowed steadily keeping land in sight on right hand tony be most anxious to help a have never have oar in hand in life vincent thought that must do more harm than good be knew ten mile from mouth of york river to fortress monroe at entrance to hampton road after rowing for three hour thought that must not be far from point therefore turned boat head toward sea rowed until must no longer make out land astern then laying on oar waited till morning vincent sitting in stern often nodding off to sleep while two negro kept up constant conversation in bow a soon a be daylight oar be again got out must clearly make out outline of coast saw break in shore marked entrance to hampton road there be light breeze now vincent must not hoist sail lest might attract attention of someone on shore did not think boat must be seen a be eight nine mile from land rowed for quarter of hour when vincent saw white sail of ship coming out from entrance breeze be so light that must thought be nearly three hour before reached spot where be now whether headed to right left of must have plenty of time to cut off for two hour dan rowed steadily wind have freshened good deal ship be now coming up fast to two others have come out after be mile astern have already made out that ship be flying flag at

bound for liverpool on arrival there be at once to go round dock take passage in steerage of next steamer going to canada fare will be about five pound said when get to canada will land at quebec have

be sufficient to pay expense to montreal leave about fifty dollar to keep till can get something to do chapter iv safely back when ship came within few hundred yard vincent stood up waved cap minute later ship be brought up into wind sail thrown aback captain appeared at side shouted to boat now fifty yard away what do want there have passenger for england vincent replied will take come alongside

go out to mr wingfield replied vincent followed to door mr wingfield sheriff said be holder of warrant to search slave hut ground for runaway negro named anthony moore property of mr jackson here do suppose sir mr wingfield asked angrily that be sort of person to give shelter to runaway slave madam certainly not sheriff replied one must suppose for moment mr wingfield of orangery must have anything to do with runaway mr jackson here learned only yesterday that wife of slave be here everyone know that where wife be husband be not likely to be far off suppose sir mr wingfield said coldly that there be necessity for to acquaint mr jackson formally with fact have purchased through agent woman sold to separate from husband by mean madam by mean though have known before might have be aid to in search have permission to see woman to question certainly not mr wingfield said if have question to ask will ask give answer want to know whether have seen husband since day of flight from plantation will certainly not ask question mr sheriff have doubt that a place from have escaped be only few mile from here did come to see wife must have be very strange if did not hope that by time man be hundred of mile away be brutally treated by brutal master who believe deliberately set to work to make run away so that must hunt down punish presume sir wish to search house suppose that man be hidden here a to slave hut plantation can of course search thoroughly a be now more than fortnight since man escaped be not likely will find hiding within few mile of master plantation so saying went into house shut door behind mr jackson ground teeth with rage sheriff rode off toward slave hut without word position of mr wingfield of orangery connected a be with old family of virginia large slave owner be beyond suspicion one must venture to suggest that lady must have smallest sympathy for runaway slave be down upon pretty hot mr jackson sheriff said a rode off seem to be in good book jackson muttered imprecation be certainly odd sheriff went on after what be telling about son pitching into andrew over flogging very slave that must go buy wife still be very different thing from hiding runaway dare say that a say fellow came here to see wife when first ran away think will find anywhere about here now be pretty certain from what hear that have made for north where fellow can be hiding ca think still wood about country be mighty big fellow can go out on farm pick corn keep going for long time be sure to be brought up sooner later thorough search be made of slave hut slave be closely questioned denied knowledge of runaway dan escaped questioning a have taken up vincent horse to house in readiness for to start a soon a have finished breakfast day searcher rode about plantation examining clump of bush assuring that none of have be used a place of refuge for runaway be good mr jackson sheriff said at last man may have be here aint here now only place have searched be house may be quite sure slave dare not conceal there too many must get to know sir be made bolt of will have to wait now till be caught by chance shot by farmer other in act of stealing must lay thousand dollar andrew jackson exclaimed passionately that young wingfield know something about whereabouts have lent hand well must advise to keep mouth shut about till get positive proof sheriff said dryly tell be joke to accuse member of family like wingfields of helping runaway slave to escape will bide time planter said said that day must lay hand on tony dead alive see if day lay hand on young wingfield well seems mr jackson sheriff remarked with sneer for be out of temper at ill success of day work that have already laid hand on son seems to quite a likely that will lay hand on a on two day afterward a vincent be riding through street of richmond saw to surprise andrew jackson in close conversation with jonas pearson wonder what two fellow be talking about said to expect jackson be trying to pump pearson a to doings at orangery like fellow never will be just sort of man to do one bad turn if have chance however a have never spoken to about affair from beginning to end see that can do mischief if want to andrew jackson however have obtained information considered valuable learned that vincent have be away in boat for five day that mother have be very uneasy about also learned that boat be one belonging to mr furniss that be only quite lately that vincent have taken to going out sailing after considerable trouble succeeded in getting at one of slave upon mr furniss plantation must only learn from vincent have be unaccompanied when went out in boat either by young furniss by of plantation hand that have taken with only own slave have come gone a chose taking out fastening up boat so that one must say when have gone out except that horse be put up at stable slave said that certainly horse have only stood there on two three occasion then only for few hour that unless mr wingfield have walked over must never have have boat out all night a horse certainly have not stood night in stable andrew jackson talked matter over with son agreed that vincent conduct be suspicious own people said have be away for five day in boat people at furniss knew nothing about therefore there must be mystery about doubted not that mystery be connected with runaway slave guessed that have taken tony landed near mouth of york river on northern shore that have put on board ship agreed however that whatever suspicion have not sufficient ground for openly accusing vincent of aiding runaway chapter v secession while vincent have be occupied with affair of tony wife public event have moved forward rapidly south carolina convention met in third week in december on th of

strongly in favor of southern brother be anxious for peace for compromise being arrived at whether north must agree to admit constitutional right of secession whether must use force to compel seceding state to remain in union be still uncertain idea of civil war be so terrible one that general belief be that arrangement to allow state to go own way must probably be arrived at for time idea of vincent going to west point be abandoned among acquaintance be several young men who be already at west point very few of returned to academy feeling there be very strongly on side of secession great majority of student came from southern state a while son of northern men went principally into trade commerce southern planter sent son into army great proportion of officer of army navy be southerner a professor at west point be military men feeling among a well a among student be in favor of state right considering that according to constitution allegiance be due first to state of be native in second place to union thus then many of professor who be native of seven state have seceded resigned appointment returned home to occupy in drilling militia levy who be at once called to arm still hoped that peace must be preserved until on th of april general beauregard who commanded troop of south carolina summoned major anderson who be in command of federal troop in fort sumter to surrender on refusal opened fire upon fort on following day on th barrack of fort being set on fire major anderson seeing hopelessness of prolonged resistance surrendered effect of news throughout united state be tremendous mr lincoln at once called out men of militia of various state to put down rebellion border state being ordered to send proportion brought matter to climax virginia north carolina kentucky tennessee missouri refused to furnish contingent to act against southern state virginia north carolina few day later passed ordinance of secession joined southern state missouri maryland delaware be divided in counsel struggle be about to commence be uneven one white population of seceding state be about while of northern state be north possessed immense advantage inasmuch a retained whole of federal navy be thereby enabled at once to cut off communication between southern state europe while must draw unlimited supply of munition of war of kind from across atlantic although people of virginia have hoped to last that peaceful arrangement might be effected act of secession be received with demand of mr lincoln that must furnish troop to crush southern brother excited livliest indignation virginia felt that there be course open to now to throw in lot with other slave state militia be at once called out volunteer called for to form provisional army to protect state from

supporter of state right when vincent told that number of friend be going to enroll a soon a list be opened offered objection to doing same of course be very young vincent one think there will be

infinitely superior four day later vincent received official letter saying that corp must be mustered in two day time next day be spent in long round of farewell visit then vincent mounted wildfire

hard work day fellow grumbled growled said be absurd threatened to do sort of thing see have come out to fight if necessary have bargained for such hard work a however jackson have way suppose anyone ever told men thought be too hard worked be not sort of man one must care about remonstrating with know yet whether be a good at fighting a be at working organizing rather expect fellow who be so earnest about everything else be sure to be earnest about fighting fancy that when once get into thick of will go through with have reputation a oddity at lexington that there be lot of remark when be made colonel sent here there be doubt that have proved right man so far although men may grumble believe in regiment be in brigade will bet money that have share of fighting what sort of man be

again with to groom horse cook food negro be not le glad at being again with master almost be men who have like dan be brought up with young owner felt for strong personal attachment if have be allowed must gladly have followed in field of battle fought by side against yankee stay at harper ferry be to be short one colonel stuart with horse be scouting along whole bank of potomac watching movement of enemy ashley horse be to join at once be not difficult for even young soldier to form idea of general nature of operation have to protect shenandoah valley to guard five great road by

continued unceasingly by time military store public property together with a much private property belonging to inhabitant who have decided to forsake home for time rather than to remain there when town be occupied by enemy a must be carried on in available wagon have be taken across bridge party of engineer who have be all night hard at work then set fire to railway bridge across river public building in town main body of troop have moved across in evening rearguard passed when be in readiness for destruction of bridge general johnston have be preparing for movement for time have foreseen that position must be evacuated a soon a enemy began to advance upon of flank considerable portion of baggage military store have time previously be sent into interior of virginia troop formed up on high ground south of river looked in silence at dense volume of smoke rising be reality of war hitherto military work have be no more than to many of be accustomed when called out with militia of state scene of destruction on now gazed brought home to that struggle be serious one that be war in stern reality have now begun troop at once set off on march at night bivouacked in wood around charleston next day pushed across country took up position covering winchester then enemy finding that johnston army be in front of ready to dispute advance recrossed river johnston concentrated force round winchester vincent joined corp on same afternoon that infantry marched out from harper ferry general sending forward with dispatch a soon a troop have got into motion will find colonel stuart in front of enemy more than can not tell be quite enough for vincent who found cavalry scouting close to patterson force prepared to attack enemy cavalry must advance to reconnoiter country to blow up bridge across stream fell tree take possible measure to delay advance of patterson army in attempt to push on toward winchester before arrival of general johnston force upon scene be glad to see back wingfield major ashley said a rode up colonel tell that in dispatch got last night from johnston general said that stuart information reached in remarkably short time having be carried with great speed by orderly in charge of duty have scarcely be out of saddle since left however think have be of use for have be busy round enemy since arrived here in afternoon fancy must think good deal stronger than be at rate have not pushed cavalry forward at a say johnston will be up to morrow afternoon winchester be safe anyhow after federal have recrossed river johnston have taken up position round winchester cavalry returned to old work of scouting along potomac on th of june movement of considerable body of enemy be noticed johnston at once dispatched jackson with brigade to martinsburg with order to send a much of rolling stock of railroad a must be removed to winchester to destroy rest to support stuart cavalry when advanced number of locomotive be sent to winchester along highroad drawn by team of horse forty engine three hundred car be burned destroyed jackson then advanced took up position on road to williamsport cavalry camp being little in advance of be pleasant for vincent a when off duty spent time with friend schoolfellow in jackson brigade on d of july scout rode into camp with news that strong force be advancing from williamsport jackson at once advanced with th virginia infantry numbering men one gun while stuart with cavalry started to make circuitous route harassed flank rear of enemy there be intention on part of jackson of fighting battle order being merely to feel enemy whose strength be far too great to be withstood even have brought whole brigade into action for numbered three brigade of infantry cavalry artillery for hour little confederate force skirmished so boldly that checked advance of enemy whose general naturally supposed that have before advanced guard of strong force therefore moved forward with great caution then confederate being threatened on flank by mass of federal fell back in good order loss be very trifling on side fact that so small force have for hour checked advance of army greatly raised spirit confidence of confederate stuart small cavalry force coming down upon enemy rear captured good many prisoner colonel stuart capturing forty four infantry riding distance ahead of troop to find out position of enemy came upon company of federal infantry sitting down in field having idea whatever that confederate force be in neighborhood stuart did not hesitate moment riding up to shouted order throw down arm be dead men believing surrounded federal threw down arm when confederate cavalry came up be marched off a prisoner jackson on reaching camp struck tent sent to rear formed up whole brigade in order of battle federal however instead of attacking continued flank movement jackson fell back through martinsburg halted for night mile beyond town next day again retired be joined six mile further on by johnston whole force for four day little army held position prepared to give battle if enemy advanced federal though greatly superior in number remained immovable at martinsburg johnston to great disgust of troop retired to winchester soldier be longing to meet invader in battle general have to bear in mind that force under command might at moment be urgently required to join main confederate army aid in opposing northern advance upon richmond stuart cavalry kept constantly informed of strength of enemy gathering in front making circuit round martinsburg learned from farmer what number of troop day came along while federal knew nothing of force opposed to believed that far outnumbered own general johnston knew that patterson force numbered about men while have be joined only by men since arrived at winchester on th of july telegram from government at richmond announced that federal grand army have driven in general beauregard picket at manassas have begun to advance johnston be directed if possible to hasten to assistance few earthwork have be thrown up at winchester gun mounted upon town be left under protection of local militia stuart cavalry be posted in long line across country to prevent news of movement reaching enemy a soon a be done infantry strong marched off troop be in high spirit now for knew that long period of inactivity be over that although ignorant when where be on march to meet enemy have wagon ration need for speed be too urgent even to permit of food being cooked without halt pressed forward steadily after two day march exhausted half famished reached manassas gap railroad here be put into train a fast a must be prepared by noon on th joined beauregard at cavalry have performed duty of preventing news of movement from reaching enemy until infantry be nearly day march away then stuart reassembled men followed johnston thus confederate plan have be completely successful over of enemy instead of being in line of battle with main army be detained before winchester while little confederate force have be facing have reached beauregard in time to take part in approaching struggle in north doubt a to power of grand army to make way to richmond be entertained troop be armed with best weapon obtainable artillery be numerous excellent army be well fed so confident be men of success that regarded whole affair in light of great picnic grand army numbered men with nine regiment of cavalry forty nine rifle gun to oppose confederate force after arrival of johnston army numbered infantry thirty five smooth bore gun cavalry many of infantry be armed only with shot gun old fowling piece gun be small ill supplied with ammunition there have be sharp fighting on th federal advance across river of bull run have be sharply repulsed therefore general determined instead of making direct attack on st against confederate position to take wide sweep round cross river higher up falling upon confederate left flank to crumple up night federal troop have marched at daybreak on st nearly men be in position on left flank of confederate latter be not taken by surprise when stuart cavalry brought in news of federal movement general beauregard instead of moving troop toward threatened point sent order to general longstreet on right to cross river a soon a battle began to fall upon federal flank rear have movement be carried out destruction of federal army must probably have be complete by one of unfortunate accident so frequently occur in war upset best laid plan order in way never came to hand when late in day error be discovered be too late to remedy at eight o'clock in morning two of federal division reached river while one of engaged confederate force stationed at bridge crossed river at ford colonel evans who commanded confederate force numbered fifteen company left men to continue to hold bridge while with hurried to oppose general hunter division have crossed at ford consisted of infantry with cavalry artillery division of equal force have crossed at red house ford higher up to check so great force with handful of men seemed impossible colonel evans determined to hold ground to last to enable general to bring up re enforcement force consisted of men of south carolina louisiana contested foot of ground regiment formed advance of federal charged supported by artillery fire be repulsed a heavy federal line advanced however confederate be slowly steadily pressed back until general bee with four regiment battery of artillery came up to assistance newcomer threw into fight with great gallantry maintained ground until almost annihilated by fire of enemy who outnumbered by five to one a fighting desperately fell back before hunter division federal who have crossed at red house ford suddenly poured down took in flank swept by terrible musketry fire troop must no longer resist in spite of effort of general who rode among imploring to stand firm until aid arrived began to fall back entreaty command be of avail troop have done that must broken disheartened retreated in great confusion at moment when seemed lost line of glittering bayonet be seen coming over hill behind general riding off in haste toward found jackson advancing with first brigade unmoved by rush of fugitive of brigade of bee evans jackson moved steadily forward so firm resolute be demeanor that bee rode after men pointing with sword to first brigade shouted look there be jackson standing like stone wall general word be repeated henceforth brigade be known a stonewall brigade general by nickname of stonewall jackson by be ever afterward known greater part of fugitive rallied took up position on right of jackson federal force who be hurrying forward assured of victory found confronted suddenly by bayonet after moment pause pressed forward again artillery preparing way for by tremendous fire jackson ordered men to lie down until enemy arrived within fifty yard then to charge with bayonet just at moment general johnston beauregard arrived on spot at once seeing desperate nature of situation whole federal army pressing forward against single brigade did best to prepare to meet storm first galloped up down disordered line of bee exhorting men to stand firm seizing color of th alabama johnston led forward formed up under fire beauregard hurried up re enforcement formed on left of jackson thus infantry artillery stuart two troop of cavalry stood face to face with more than infantry seven troop of regular cavalry behind whom at lower ford be men in reserve while men be lying down awaiting attack jackson rode backward forward in front of a calm a unconcerned to appearance a if on parade ground quiet bravery greatly nerved encouraged young troop at once tremendous artillery fire of enemy ceased infantry came on in massive line four confederate gun poured in fire then withdrew behind infantry when line came within fifty yard of jackson gave word men sprang to foot poured in heavy volley then charged wild yell rose from rank a closed then be mingled in desperate conflict for time be in wild confusion ardor courage of jackson men prevailed burst through center of federal line immediately jackson have charged beauregard sent forward rest of troop for time tremendous struggle took place along whole line general bee barlow fell mortally wounded at head of troop general hampton be wounded many of colonel fell so numerous be federal although jackson have pierced center mass drove back flank threatened to surround with voice example cheered on men to hold ground officer closed up rank a be thinned by enemy fire for hour struggle continued without marked advantage on side jackson calmness be unshaken even in excitement of fight at one time officer rode up to from portion of field exclaimed general think day be going against to jackson replied in usual curt manner if think so sir have better not say anything about resolute stand of confederate enabled general beauregard to bring up fresh troop at last gave word to advance jackson brigade rushed forward on receiving order burst through federal with whom be engaged supported by reserve drove enemy from plateau then federal though vastly superior in force brought up reserve prepared to renew attack fresh men of army of shenandoah came upon field of battle smith early brought up division from river whole southern line advanced at charge drove enemy down slope on toward ford panic seized regiment broke up took to headlong flight soon became utter rout many of continued flight for hour for time federal army ceased to exist have confederate advanced a jackson desired that must do washington must have fallen into hand without blow being struck in defense first great battle of war be sometimes known a battle of manassas more generally a bull run with exception of one two charge little body of confederate horse did not take part in battle of bull run have be aware of utter stampede of northern troop must safely have pressed forward in hot pursuit a far a washington being numerically so inferior to federal cavalry in ignorance that northern infantry have become mere panic stricken mob must have be imprudent in extreme for handful of cavalry to undertake pursuit of army many of confederate be of opinion that decisive victory must be end of war that north seeing that south be able a well a willing to defend position have taken up must abandon idea of coercing into submission hope be speedily dissipated north be indeed alike astonished disappointed at defeat of army by greatly inferior force instead of abandoning struggle set to work to retrieve disaster to place in field force must believed prove irresistible vincent wingfield saw little of battle at bull run a be impatiently waiting order to charge while desperate conflict between jackson brigade enemy be at fiercest shell from one of federal battery burst few yard in front of troop one of piece

journey have be injurious to for bandage have become somewhat loose broken piece of bone have grated upon other be much longer in knitting together than must have be have be treated on spot a soon a must walk became anxious to rejoin troop doctor said that many week must elapse before must be able to undergo hardship of campaign be reconciled to extent to delay by letter from friend with troop by perusal of paper there be nothing whatever doing in virginia two army still faced other northerner protected by strong fortification have thrown up round washington fortification much too formidable to be attacked by confederate held a be by force immensely superior to own in number arm northerner be indeed hard at work collecting organizing army be to crush out rebellion general scott have be succeeded by mcclellan in supreme command new general be indefatigable in organizing vast mass of men raised in north so great be effort that in few month after defeat of bull run north have men in arm while move have at present be made against virginia there be sharp fighting in of border state especially in missouri kentucky in of public opinion be much divided regiment be raised on side various operation be now undertaken by federal fleet at point along coast several important position be taken occupied being impossible for confederate to defend so long line of seacoast south have lost rather than gained ground in consequence of victory at bull run for time have be unduly elated be altogether disposed to underrate enemy to believe that struggle be a good a over thus then made effort at corresponding to north a time went on saw vastness of preparation made for conquest people of southern state again bestirred owing to north having command of sea shutting up principal port have to rely upon for everything while north must draw arm ammunition requisite of war from market of europe foundry be accordingly established for manufacture of artillery factory for musket ammunition percussion cap south have in fact to manufacture everything down to cloth for soldier uniform leather for shoe a in past have relied wholly upon north for such good be for time impossible to supply troop with even most necessary article woman throughout state be set to work spinning weaving rough cloth making uniform from leather however can not be produced at once indeed with effort confederate authority be never throughout war able to provide sufficient supply of boot for troop many battle be won by soldier who fought almost barefooted who reshod for most part by stripping boot from dead foe many other article must not be produced in southern state confederate suffered much from want of proper medicine surgical appliance for many other necessary have to depend solely upon ship succeeded in making way through enemy cruiser running blockade of port wine tea coffee other imported article soon became luxury beyond mean of even very wealthy sort of substitute be used grain roasted ground being chiefly used a substitute for coffee hitherto south have be principally occupied in raising cotton tobacco depending chiefly upon north for food be necessary now to abandon cultivation of product for have sale to devote land to growth of maize other crop for food by time that long period of inaction came to close vincent have completely recovered strength be ready to rejoin rank a soon a order came from colonel stuart who have promised to send for directly there be prospect of active service one of vincent first question a soon a became convalescent be whether letter have be received from tony have come be told among last batch of letter crossed frontier before outbreak of hostility mr wingfield have a have requested opened a have be arranged have merely contained tony address at village near montreal for vincent have warned to say nothing in letter for there be saying in troubled time be approaching when tony left into whose hand might fall vincent have before starting told mother of share have taken in getting negro safely away mr wingfield brought up a have be to regard who assisted runaway slave to escape in same light a who assisted to steal other kind of property be at first greatly shocked when heard that son have taken part in such enterprise however worthy of compassion slave might be however brutal master from whose hand have fled however a vincent be on point of starting for war to meet danger possibly death in defense of virginia have said little little be in reference rather to imprudence of course have taken than to what regarded in own mind a folly indeed criminality have however promised that a soon a tony letter arrived must if still possible forward dinah child to supplying with money for journey giving paper freeing from slavery vincent have duly signed in presence of justice when letter came however be already too late fighting be on point of commencing intercourse across border be stopped train be taken up for conveyance of troop even man must have have great difficulty in passing northward while for unprotected negress with baby journey must have be impossible mr wingfield have therefore written four time at fortnightly interval to tony saying that be impossible to send dinah off at present that must be dispatched a soon a trouble be over upon receipt of letter from saying that address be unchanged giving new one letter be duly posted be probable that one other of must in time reach tony a mail be sent off to europe whenever opportunity offered for to be taken by steamer running blockade from southern port dinah therefore still remained at orangery be well happy for life there be delightful one indeed after toil hardship at jackson although be anxious to join husband knowledge that be well safe from pursuit sooner later must join with child be sufficient to make perfectly contented during vincent illness have be most constant attendant for child now no longer required care passed much of time down at nursery where young child of slave be looked after by two three aged negress past active work have therefore begged mr wingfield to be allowed to take place by bedside of young master after giving trial mr wingfield found so quiet gentle patient that installed there be able to obtain rest needed with feeling of confidence that vincent must be well attended to in absence when vincent be well enough to be about again sister be surprised at change have taken place in since have started few month before for war be not so much that have grown though have done so considerably that be much older in manner appearance have be doing man work work requiring vigilance activity courage must no longer treat a boy a became stronger took to riding about plantation not upon wildfire for horse be still with troop colonel stuart having promised to see that animal be well cared for that one must ride upon hope like jonas pearson better than used to do vincent mr wingfield said day two before started to rejoin troop ca say do mother replied shortly man be very civil to now too civil in fact like believe be honest mean that must cheat though may do so for anything know pretend to be violent secessionist a come from vermont be not natural imagine must sing different tune if bluecoat ever get to richmond still have nothing particular to say against except like trust so long a everything go on well for confederacy suppose matter if must ever get worst of will see fellow will be mischievous illustration map country between richmond fort monroe however hear that have obeyed order that there have be flogging on estate since went away in fact a far a can see doe not keep anything like sharp hand over slave a used to do in of field work seems to be done in very slovenly way what game be know have doubt that have game in mind be most prejudiced boy mr wingfield said laughing first of man be too strict be furious about now think be too lenient at once suspect have what call game of sort other on be hard to please indeed vincent smiled well a told once before will see hope be wrong pearson be that believe to be own may be prejudiced against nothing will persuade that be not from that jackson learned that dinah be here be to that owe visit of sheriff searching plantation for tony however whatever man be at heart can a far a see do injury a long a thing go on a be sincerely trust will never have opportunity of doing so during winter vincent have made acquaintance of many of southern leader town be center of movement heart of confederacy be against a capital of southern state that effort of northerner be principally directed to flocked leading men from part of country although virginian family have of member at front feeling of anxiety reigned everywhere semblance of gayety be kept up theater be opened party ball given in order to keep up spirit of people by example of of higher rank ball differed widely in appearance from of eighteen month before gentleman be almost in uniform already calico other cheap fabric be worn by many of lady a foreign dress material must no longer be purchased mr wingfield made point of always attending entertainment with daughter to young people afforded cheerful break in dullness monotony of usual life for owing to absence of almost young men with army there have be long cessation of pleasant interchange of visit impromptu party social gathering have formed feature in life of virginia ball must have be dull affair have only resident of richmond be present leave be granted a much a possible to officer stationed with regiment within railway run of town a eagerly availed of change from monotony of camp life girl have reason to complain of want of partner here at reception given by president davis vincent met leader of confederacy civil military many of have be personal friend of wingfields before secession movement began among be general magruder who commanded troop round richmond early in winter general have called at orangery be going to make call upon patriotism of planter of neighborhood mr wingfield said during lunch time see army be facing of federal opposite washington can offer firm front to foe marching down from north unfortunately have command of sea there be nothing to prevent embarking army on board ship landing in james york river in case might make rush upon richmond before there must be time to bring down troop to aid be therefore proposing to erect chain of work between two river so a to be able to keep even large army at bay until re enforcement arrive to do large number of hand will be required be going to ask proprietor of plantation to place a many negro a can spare at disposal there can be no doubt a to response quest will meet with general at present have scarcely enough work for slave to do intend to grow tobacco next year for will only rot in warehouse comparatively small number of hand be required to raise corn crop have about hundred seventy working hand on orangery will be happy to place hundred at disposal for a long time a may require if want fifty more can of course have everything else must at present give way to good of cause thank much mr wingfield for offer will put name down first on list of contributor seem quite to have recovered now said to vincent few minute afterward yes be ashamed of staying here so long general feel pain at time a there be nothing doing at front doctor say that be of importance must have rest a long a possible have stayed on major ashley have promised to recall a soon a there be prospect of active work think be quite likely that there will be active work here a soon a anywhere else general said know pretty well what be doing at washington though nothing have be decided upon there be party in favor of landing in force here if so will have hot work what do say if like will get commission appoint one of aid de camp knowledge of country will make useful a ashley have specially mentioned name in one of dispatch can have commission by asking for if there be to be fighting round here will be of more interest to defending own home than in taking part in general engagement for safety of state will too enable to be good deal at home although so far slave have behaved extremely well there be saying exactly what may happen if northerner come among can rejoin own corp afterward know if nothing come of vincent be at first inclined to decline offer mother sister be so pleased at having near that finally accepted with thanks being principally influenced by general last argument that possibly there might be trouble with slave in event of landing in james peninsula by northerner few day later there came official intimation

strength with enemy nothing be known of fact that next morning have be fixed for encounter secret being kept to last lest spy adherent of north might take news to fleet after putting up horse vincent went down to navy yard off merrimac be lying ship have be sunk by federal when at commencement of hostility have evacuated norfolk having be raised by confederate ship be cut down sort of roof covered with iron be built over so that vessel presented appearance of huge sunken house ram be fixed to bow be armed with ten gun steam power be very insufficient for size must only move through water at rate of five knot hour be ugly looking thing man observed to vincent a gazed at ship frightfully ugly vincent agreed may be formidable machine in way of fighting one can scarcely call ship be floating battery if tried best to turn out ugliest thing that ever floated must not have succeeded better be just like noah ark sunk down to eaves of roof yes be good deal like vincent agreed very look of ought to be enough to frighten federal even if did nothing else expect will not be long before give taste of quality man said have got coal ammunition on board there be nothing to prevent going out evening if want to will be worth seeing when doe go out to fight northerner vincent said will be new experiment in warfare if turn out success suppose navy in world will be taking to cover up with iron next morning be th of march date forever memorable in naval annals smoke be seen pouring out from funnel of merrimac there be sign of activity on board patrick henry of six gun jamestown raleigh beaufort teazer little craft carrying one gun at eleven o'clock moved down inlet on norfolk be situated news that merrimac be going out to attack enemy have now spread whole population of norfolk turned out hastened down toward mouth of inlet on horseback in vehicle on foot while vincent rode to battery on sewell point nearly facing fortress monroe left horse at farmhouse quarter of mile from battery for wildfire be always restless under fire be probable that battery must take share in affair at one o'clock of small federal lookout launch be seen to be at work signaling bustle must be observed prevailing among large ship over by fortress be evident that merrimac be now visible to a came down inlet cumberland congress men of war moved out in direction minnesota st lawrence be at anchor got under way assisted by steam tug merrimac fleet of little gunboat be now visible from battery advancing against cumberland congress former opened fire upon at distance of mile with heavy pivot gun merrimac without replying continued slow steady course toward first approached congress a did so puff of smoke burst from forward end of pent house water round congress be churned up by hail of grape shot a passed other vessel fired broadside officer in fort provided with glass must see effect of merrimac fire in light patch showed on side of congress merrimac appeared entirely uninjured now approached cumberland poured several broadside into altogether without effect merrimac without replying steamed straight on struck cumberland with great force knocking large hole in side near water line then backing off opened fire upon for hour crew of cumberland fought with great bravery ship lay about three hundred yard apart shot from merrimac told on wooden vessel water be pouring in through breach shell of merrimac crushed in through side at one time set on fire crew worked gun until vessel sank beneath foot men succeeded in swimming to land be not far distant others be saved by small boat from shore nearly half of crew of men be either killed in action drowned merrimac now turned attention to congress be left to fight battle alone a minnesota have got aground roanoke st lawrence must not approach near enough to render assistance from draught of water merrimac poured broadside after broadside into until officer in command many of crew be killed lieutenant who succeeded to command seeing there be prospect of help resistance be hopeless hauled down flag gunboat be sent alongside with order that crew must leave congress come on board a ship be to be burned troop artillery lining shore now opened fire on little gunboat consequently hauled off merrimac after firing several more shell into congress moved away to attack minnesota survivor of men who composed crew of congress be conveyed to shore in small boat vessel be set on fire either by own crew shell of merrimac by midnight blew up owing to willowness of water merrimac must not get near enough to minnesota to use own small gun to advantage gunboat be driven off by heavy ten inch gun of federal frigate therefore at seven o'clock merrimac consort returned to norfolk greatest delight be felt on shore at success of engagement on riding back to norfolk vincent learned that ram must go out again next morning to engage rest of federal fleet have suffered somewhat in fight loss in men be only two killed eight wounded two of gun have muzzle shot off armor be damaged in place most serious of have badly twisted ram in running into cumberland still appeared that be more than match for rest of federal fleet that must fly be destroyed a general have given three day leave vincent be able to stay to see close of affair early next morning again rode down to sewell point a merrimac be to start at daybreak at six o'clock ironclad came out from river made for minnesota be still aground latter be seen to run up signal spectator saw object have not before perceived coming out a if to meet ram glass be directed toward general exclamation of surprise be heard what be thing look like raft with two round turret upon funnel moment consideration truth burst upon be ship have heard of a building at new york have be launched six week before be indeed monitor have arrived during night just in time to save rest of federal fleet be first regular ironclad ever built be turret ship carrying two very heavy gun showing only between two three foot above water excitement upon shore a adversary approached other be intense moved slowly not until be within hundred yard distance did monitor open fire merrimac replying at once fire for short time be heavy rapid distance between combatant varying from fifty to two hundred yard monitor have by far greatest speed be much more easily turned than confederate ram gun be very much heavier merrimac while still keeping up fight made toward mouth of river suddenly turned steamed directly at monitor before latter must get out of way struck on side ram be bent weak engine be insufficient to propel with necessary force consequently inflicted damage on monitor action continued turret ship directing fire at iron roof of ram while latter pointed gun especially at turret pilot house of monitor at length after battle have lasted six hour monitor withdrew one of plate of pilot house being seriously damaged commander injured in eye when foe drew off merrimac steamed back to norfolk there be men killed in battle side claimed victory federal upon ground that have driven off merrimac confederate because monitor have retreated from fight vessel however held strength of other in respect monitor remaining a sentinel over ship transport at fortress monroe while merrimac at norfolk continued to guard entrance into james river a soon a fight be over vincent wingfield greatly pleased that have witnessed so strange interesting combat rode back to norfolk same evening reached richmond where description of fight be received with greatest interest excitement chapter viii mcclellan advance be not until three week after fight between ironclad that great army under general mcclellan arrived off fortress monroe greater portion of troop coming down potomac in steam transport vast quantity of store have be accumulated in around fortress gun of size never before used in war be lying on wharf in readiness to be placed in battery while hampton road be crowded with transport store vessel watched over by monitor other warship mcclellan army be large one not so strong force a have intended to have taken with a soon a arrived at fortress monroe learned that must not be able to expect much assistance from fleet merrimac completely closed james river be more powerful vessel of fleet to move up york river must be able to sally out destroy rest of fleet transport a be most important to clear peninsula between two river before magruder must receive strong re enforcement portion of troop be at once landed on th of april men one hundred gun disembarked started on march against yorktown a soon a news of arrival of northern army at fortress monroe reached richmond fresh step be taken for defense of city magruder soon found that must be impossible with force at command to hold line have proposed large body of negro troop be set to work to throw up defense between yorktown point on warwick river thirteen half mile away portion of line be covered by warwick creek dammed up to make unfordable erected battery to guard dam across intervening ground weak earthwork with trench be constructed there being time to raise stronger work magruder relied chiefly upon swampy difficult nature of country concealment afforded by forest rendered difficult for enemy to discover weakness of defender posted men at yorktown gloucester point remaining troop under command be scattered along line of work to warwick river knew that if mcclellan pushed forward with force must be successful knew also that if enemy must be held in check for few day assistance must reach from general johnston army fortunately for confederate weather have be fine clear during previous week changed on very day that mcclellan started rain came down in torrent road became almost impassable column struggled on along deep muddy track day bivouacked for night in forest next morning resumed march on reaching first line of intrenchment formed by confederate found deserted be not until approached warwick creek that encountered serious opposition have pushed forward at once must have unquestionably captured richmond mcclellan fault be over caution believed opposed by very much larger force than under command of magruder consequently instead of making attack at once began regular siege operation against work on warwick creek at delay saved richmond day re enforcement arrived by time that mcclellan army over strong have erected battery got heavy gun into position magruder have be re enforced by men under general johnston who now assumed command while other division be hurrying up from northern western virginia upon very night before battery be ready to open confederate evacuated position fell back carrying with gun store to chickahominy river ran almost across peninsula at distance of six mile only from richmond confederate crossed broke down bridge prepared to make stand disappointment of federal be great after ten day of incessant labor hardship have only gained possession of village of yorktown tract of low swampy country division in front pressed forward rapidly after confederate have managed plan so well that be safely across stream before be overtaken dismay in richmond have for few day be great many people left town for interior taking valuable with be prepared for removal of state paper document a federal went on with fortification re enforcement began to arrive confidence be restored went on a before great federal army be so scattered through forest discipline of of division be so lax that be day before mcclellan have ranged in order on chickahominy week elapsed before be in position to undertake fresh operation general johnston have now four division on spot be too enterprising general to await attack consequently crossed chickahominy fell upon one of federal division almost destroyed drove back whole of left wing next morning battle be renewed lasted for five hour be fortunate indeed for confederate that right wing of northern army did not while action be going on cross river march straight upon richmond communication be difficult from one part of army to owing to thick forest swampy state of ground being without order remained inactive day loss on side have be men while confederate have lost general johnston being seriously wounded chief command be given to general lee by far ablest soldier war produced satisfied with success have gained confederate fell back across river again on th of june general stuart for have now be promoted started with cavalry two gun in forty eight hour made one of most adventurous reconnoissances ever undertaken first force rode out to hanover courthouse where encountered defeated first small body of cavalry afterward whole regiment then after destroying store there rode round to pamunky burned two vessel large quantity of store captured train of forty wagon burned railway bridge then passed right round federal rear crossed river re entered city with prisoner horse having effected destruction of vast quantity of store besides breaking up railway burning bridge toward end of june mcclellan learned that stonewall jackson having struck heavy blow at two greatly superior army be operating against in valley of shenandoah have succeeded in evading be marching toward richmond have just completed several bridge across river be about to move forward to fight great battle when news reached believing that must be opposed by army of men although in fact confederate army after jackson available re enforcement came up be still somewhat inferior in strength to own determined to abandon for present attempt upon richmond to fall back upon james river here ship have already landed store for supply for river be now open a far a confederate defense at fort darling norfolk navy yard have be captured by men who formed garrison of fortress monroe resistance have be offered a confederate troop have be concentrated for defense of richmond when norfolk be captured merrimac steamed out to make way out of river water be low pilot declared that must not be taken up consequently be set on fire burned to water edge thus main obstacle to advance of federal fleet be removed have advanced a far a fort darling ironclad gunboat have engaged battery there shot however did little damage to defender upon lofty bluff while shot from battery so injured gunboat that attempt to force passage be abandoned while falling back to place called harrison landing on james river federal be attacked by confederate after desperate fighting on side lasting for five day succeeded in drawing off from chickahominy with loss of fifty gun thousand of small arm loss of greater part of store idea of further advance against richmond be for present abandoned president lincoln have always be opposed to plan considerable portion of army be moved round to join force under general pope be now to march upon richmond from north from commencement of federal advance to time when beaten dispirited regained james river vincent wingfield have seen little of family federal line have at one time be within mile of orangery slave have day

make way in out northerner have placed flotilla of gunboat on river by aid of be gradually making way into heart of several of state be thinking of going out to orangery again soon mother vincent asked on evening before setting out on march north think not vincent there be so much to do in hospital here that can not leave must be ashamed to be living in luxury at orangery with girl while other woman be giving up whole time nursing wounded besides although anticipate after way have be hurled back northerner will try again for time now be in possession of harrison landing can at moment advance besides be not pleasant being obliged to turn out of one house leave everything to mercy wrote yesterday to pearson to bring slave back at once take up work will go over occasionally to see that everything be in order at rate for time will stop here think be best mother certainly must feel more comfortable knowing that be at richmond than alone out there must be worse off than thousand of lady over state vincent there be whole district where white capable of using gun have gone to war leaving nothing woman slave behind have not heard of single case in there have be trouble certainly there be chance of trouble with slave mother in of other plantation may not be so at rate quiet conduct of slave everywhere be very best answer must be given to accusation have be made a to cruel treatment at present whole of property of slave owner throughout southern state be at mercy might burn kill destroy yet in single instance have risen against what be called oppressor even when federal have be close at hand please keep eye on dinah mother distrust fellow jackson so thoroughly that believe capable of having carried off smuggled away somewhere down south sold there if saw chance wish instead of sending to orangery must keep a one of servant here will if wish vincent can not believe for moment jackson anyone else must venture to meddle with of slave perhaps not mother be best to be on safe side anyhow will be glad to know that be with young jackson will be away for know be in one of stuart troop of horse though have never happened to run against since war began firing have hardly ceased before harrison landing when general jackson with force of about men composed of own division now commanded by general winder general ewell division portion of of general hill started for rapidan to check general pope who plundering wasting country a advanced be marching south object being to reach gordonsville where must cut line of railway connecting richmond with west virginia vincent be glad that regiment to have be appointed must be under jackson command that must be campaigning again with old division consisted largely of virginian troop contained so many of old friend with jackson too be certain to be engaged in stirring service for general ever kept troop upon march striking blow where least expected traversing such extent of country by rapid march that division seemed to enemy to almost ubiquitous be few hour after received appointment that vincent took train from richmond to gordonsville dan being in horse box with wildfire in rear of train regiment be encamped mile two away at once rode on reported to colonel jones who commanded be glad to have with sir colonel said have pleasure of knowing father be old friend of mother family a be in ashley horse have be serving on magruder staff be well up in duty be comfort to that vacancy have be filled up by one who know work instead of raw hand have have brush two already with enemy at present be watching other waiting on side till general have got infantry to front in readiness for advance jackson be waiting for hill division to come up believe pope be expecting great re enforcement from mcclellan few day later colonel jones be ordered to take charge of picket posted on rapidan before reaching orange gentleman rode up at full speed informed that enemy be in possession of town colonel jones divided regiment into two part with one charged federal cavalry in main street of orange while other portion of regiment under major marwill attacked on flank after sharp fight enemy be driven from place brought up large re enforcement pouring in heavy fire attacked town on side confederate have to fall back made stand little way out of town drove back federal cavalry who be pressing although fight have be short one loss in cavalry rank have be serious colonel jones while charging at head of men have received saber wound major marwill be taken prisoner five day later on th of august jackson received intelligence that general burnside with considerable portion of mcclellan force have embarked be on way to join pope determined to strike blow at once marched with entire force from gordonsville for barnett ford on rapidan at daybreak next morning cavalry crossed river attacked routed body of federal cavalry on road to culpeper courthouse on following day jackson came up with infantry to point about eight mile from culpeper where pope army strong be stationed upon crest of hill general ewell division be only one then up at once advanced after severe artillery fight gained point on hill where gun must command enemy position jackson division now came up a be moving into position general winder be killed by shell for hour jackson did not attempt to advance a hill division have not come up encouraged by delay enemy at five o'clock in afternoon took offensive advanced through cornfield lying between two army attacked ewell division on confederate right while shortly afterward fell with overwhelming strength on jackson left attacking in front flank rear drove back pressed upon with such force that day appeared lost at moment jackson rode down among confused wavering troop by voice example rallied at same moment old stonewall brigade came up at run poured fire into advancing enemy jackson led troop have rallied forward stonewall brigade fell upon enemy flank drove back with terrible slaughter other brigade came up there be general charge along whole confederate line federal be driven back mile beyond position have occupied at commencement of fight to shelter of thick wood prisoner be taken over small arm battle be known a cedar run completely checked pope advance upon richmond troop be too much exhausted to follow up victory jackson urged to press forward moved mile half in advance then found so strongly opposed that jackson believing that enemy must have received re enforcement halted men colonel jones be sent forward to reconnoiter discovered that large force have joined enemy for two day jackson remained on field have won troop have be busy in burying dead in collecting wounded sending to rear in gathering arm thrown away by enemy in flight being assured that enemy be now too strong to be attacked by force under command jackson fell back to orange courthouse there be now few day delay while mass of troop be on side moving toward new field of action mcclellan marched troop across james peninsula from harrison landing to yorktown there greater portion be embarked in transport taken up rappahannock to aquia creek landed there marched to fredericksburg lee instead of attacking mcclellan on march across peninsula determined to take army north at once to join jackson attack pope before be joined by mcclellan army pope although already largely re enforced retired hastily took up new position so strongly fortified that must not be attacked general stuart have come up with lee be in command of cavalry will see work now be remark round fire of th virginia cavalry hitherto although have be several time engaged with federal have be forced to remain for most part inactive owing to vast superiority in force of enemy cavalry now that stuart have come up felt certain that disparity of number there must soon be dashing work to be done except when upon actual duty strict line of military discipline be much relaxed among cavalry trooper being almost son of farmer planter of equal social rank with officer many of whom be personal friend relative several of vincent schoolfellow be in rank two three of be fellow officer often gathered together round camp fire chatted over old schooldays mutual friend many of have already fallen for virginia regiment of stonewall jackson brigade have be terribly thinned loss of so many friend knowledge that own turn might come next did not suffice to lessen high spirit of brave young men hard work rough life exposure hardship have braced invigorated be attaining far more vigorous manhood than must ever have possessed have grown up in somewhat sluggish enervating life led by young planter many of young men have until campaign began never done hour hard work in life have be waited upon by slave only exercise have be riding for month now have almost lived in saddle have slept in open air have thought lucky if must obtain sufficient meal of roughest food to satisfy hunger once day in respect however cavalry be better off than comrade of infantry for scouting a did in small party over wide extent of country be sure of meal hearty welcome whenever must spare time to stop for hour at house of farmer be glorious life wingfield when chatted over future at school never dreamed of life a though of did talk of entering army even then occasional skirmish with indian be limit of idea yes be glorious life vincent agreed can not imagine anything more exciting of course there be risk of being shot somehow one never seems to think of there be always something to do to think about from time one start on scout at daybreak to when one lie down at night one sens be on stretch besides be fighting in defense of country not merely a profession though suppose after make much difference when one be once in for a far a have read soldier enjoy campaigning doe not seem to make difference to who be foe what be fighting about must like to feel little more sure that will win in long run there be chorus of indignant protest against there being possible doubt a to issue why have thrashed time have met wingfield be very well vincent said here in virginia have held own more than held have beat back scott mcclellan now have thrashed pope stonewall jackson have won dozen battle in west virginia must remember that in other part be gradually closing in port not already taken be closely blockaded be pushing along line of great river worst of can fill up vacancy with hired emigrant a fast a one army disappears take place believe will beat again again will prove a have proved before one southerner fighting for home liberty be more than match for two hired soldier even with good large sprinkling of yankee among in long run be not sure that will win for can go on putting big army into field while day must get used up of course be possible that may day capture washington that north may get weary of tremendous drain of money men caused by attempt to conquer hope may be so for must like to think that must win in long run never feel doubt about winning battle when begin only fear be that may get used up before north be tired of did not expect to hear talk so wingfield for always seem to be in capital spirit be in capital spirit vincent replied ready to fight again again always confident will lick yankee fact have doubt whether in long run will outlast doe not interfere in slightest degree with comfort at present be very sorry though that fellow pope be carrying on war so brutally instead of in manner in general mcclellan other commander have waged proclamation that army must subsist upon country pass through give direct invitation to soldier to pillage order that farmer who refuse to take oath to union be to be driven from home sent down south mean ruin to peaceful inhabitant for there be scarcely man in part of virginia who be not heartily with hear one of other officer said that prisoner who be captured morning say that pope already see that have made mistake that yesterday issued fresh order saying that proclamation be not meant to authorize pillage find that inhabitant who before private sentiment be maintained sort of neutrality be now hostile that drive off cattle into wood even set fire to stack to prevent anything from being carried off by yank troop find road broken up bridge destroyed sort of difficulty thrown in way doe not always pay even in war to be brutal be glad to see have found out mistake so soon officer said mcclellan waged war like gentleman if blackguard be to be allowed to carry fire sword through land will soon find be game that two can play at matter will become horribly embittered will never do vincent said general be gentleman lee jackson many others be true christian a well a true soldier be sure will never countenance on side whatever northerner may do be ready to fight horde of yankee hired soldier a often a advance against be sure that none of must fire homestead ill treat defenseless men woman be scandal that such brutality be committed by ruffian who call southerner guerrilla in missouri tennessee be equally bad whether on side other if be president must send down couple of regiment hunt down fellow who bring dishonor on cause if south can not free without aid of ruffian of kind have better lay down arm at once bravo wingfield spoken like knight of chivalry one of others laughed many of band have done good nevertheless have kept enemy busy there occupied attention of very large force who might otherwise have be in wood yonder with pope agree with must be better if whole thing be fought out with large army there be good deal to be said for band be so severe upon be composed of men who have be made desperate by seeing farm harried building burned by enemy have be denounced a traitor by neighbor on other side if retaliate know that be to be altogether blamed know that if place at home be burned down people insulted ill treated must be inclined to set off to avenge so must vincent agreed must be upon who did wrong not upon innocent people be very well if other side destroy people farm be only by showing that two can play at game that can make observe law of war grant must be very much better that such thing must take place if northerner begin sort of work may be sure that there will be retaliation anyhow be glad that be officer in th virginia not guerrilla leader in missouri well talking be dry work have one got full canteen have vincent said dan managed to buy gallon of rum at farmhouse yesterday think farmer be afraid that enemy might be paying visit before many day thought best to get rid of spirit anyhow dan got keg at ordinary city price a well a pair of fine turkey be just bringing along for supper so have better get ration bread fall to there be cheer a dan placed turkey down in center of group soon whole party using bread a plate fell to upon afterward joined in many merry song while dan handed round jar of spirit chapter ix prisoner party round fire be just about to disperse when captain of vincent troop approached took horn of spirit water vincent held up to tossed off be stirrup cup wingfield what be for duty captain vincent asked a rose to foot yes troop harper be to muster get men together quietly think be serious business of regiment furnishes troop believe stuart take command sound like work indeed vincent said will get troop together sir there be to be trumpet call wingfield be to get off a quietly a possible most of men be already fast asleep a soon a learned that there be prospect of active work be full of life animation girth of saddle be tightened sword buckled on revolver carefully examined before being placed in holster many of men carried repeating rifle magazine be filled before be slung across rider shoulder in few minute three troop be mounted in readiness for start almost directly afterward colonel jones rode up took command thrill of satisfaction ran through men a did so for be certain that must not be going in command of detachment unless occasion be important one for few minute move be made suppose others be going to join here vincent said to officer next suppose so replied lie in middle of cavalry brigade with two regiment side of so be likely enough be gathering place yes can hear tramping of horse felt spot of rain vincent said have be having lightning for time fear be in for wet ride contingent from other regiment soon arrived just a last came up general stuart appeared took place at head of party now strong short a time have be since vincent felt first drop rain be now coming down in torrent one by one bright flame of fire died down darkness became so intense that vincent must scarcely see officer on right hand hope man who rode up with general be doubt to be guide know country well be joke finding way through forest on night a believe stuart got eye like cat officer said sometimes on dark night have come galloping up to post where be in command when one must scarcely see one hand before one never seems to make difference to day night ride about at gallop trust horse vincent said that be only way in dark can see much better than can if men must let go own way instead of trying to guide must seldom run against anything only thing be to lie well down on horse neck otherwise one might get swept out of saddle by bough be question of nerve think not many of must do a stuart doe trust entirely to horse instinct word be now passed down line that perfect silence be to be observed that be to move forward in column rank closing up a much a possible so a not to lose touch of other with head bent down blanket wrapped around a cloak cavalry rode off through pouring rain thunder be crashing overhead flash of lightning enabled to keep place in close column went at rapid trot even who be ready to charge body of enemy however numerous without moment hesitation experienced feeling of nervousness a rode on in darkness through thick forest on unknown errand that be going northward knew knew also after short time that must be entering line of enemy saw sign of watch fire for must long since have be quenched by downpour after hour brisk riding knew by sharp sound of beat of horse hoof that have left soft track through forest be now upon regular road thank goodness for vincent said in low tone to next neighbor mind brush with enemy own like idea at moment brain may be knocked out by branch of tree agree with other replied fancy man felt same there be doubt a to hitherto sound have be heard save jingling of accouterment dull heavy sound of horse tread now there must be heard mingled with buzz of voice occasionally low laugh be so accustomed to wet that soaking scarcely inconvenienced be out of forest now felt sure of guide a to enemy only longed to discover for hour rapid advance continued felt sure that must now have penetrated through enemy line be well in rear at last heard challenge of sentry then stuart voice shouted charge at full gallop rode into village at catlet station on orange alexandria railroad where general pope have headquarters minute be in midst of enemy camp where wildest confusion reigned federal officer rushed from tent made off in darkness soldier who be lying on line of railroad leaped to foot opened heavy fire on invisible foe against cavalry broken up in camp with tent animal pile of baggage must do little for be impossible to form up in broken unknown ground quarter of pope be soon discovered have escaped leaving coat hat behind many of officer be captured in quarter be found box of official paper be invaluable a among be copy of letter asking for re enforcement list giving strength position of troop other particular of greatest value to confederate time be lost a firing must set whole federal army on alert might find retreat cut off therefore placing prisoner in center taking box of paper with cavalry be called off from camp without delay started on return ride did not take road by have come made long detour just a daylight be breaking re entered confederate line without having encountered foe from time of leaving catlet station short a stay in camp have be few of men have returned empty handed northern army be supplied with abundance of excellent food of description forming strongest possible contrast to insufficient ration upon confederate troop existed trooper have helped to whatever must lay hand upon in darkness confusion rode in with ham slung on side of saddle others have secured bottle two of wine spirit have be fortunate enough to lay hand on tin of coffee canister of tea luxury for month have be unknown to save when be captured from enemy only article captured of possible utility be general pope coat be sent to richmond where be hung up for public inspection wag sticking up paper beside be coat in general pope be going to ride in triumph into richmond coat be here general have not yet arrived confederate have lost two three men from fire of federal infantry be in high spirit at success of raid sooner have general lee informed of content of paper position of enemy force than determined to strike heavy blow at general jackson who

speed be fired at did not stop got safely through to manassas two train followed be captured by time alarm have spread more train arrived jackson have gained point have placed on line of communication of enemy position be dangerous one indeed lee who be following be still far away army be marching from fredericksburg against must be dispatched from washington a soon a news of presence be known pope might turn crush before lee must arrive to assistance worn out a troop be be necessary at once to gain possession of manassas st north carolina st georgia volunteered for service joined by stuart with

of description forwarded for use of officer then set to work to pile enormous mass of store together to set on fire while be engaged at brigade of new jersey troop have come out from washington to save manassas be attacked utterly routed ewell division have remained at bristoe while of hill jackson moved to manassas in course of afternoon ewell saw whole of pope army marching against held in check for hour thus gave troop at manassas time to destroy completely vast accumulation of store when stuart cavalry covering retreat fell back at nightfall through manassas nothing blackened cinder remained where federal depot have be situated blow to northerner be a heavy a be unexpected pope have longer provision for men forage for cattle there be nothing left for to force way past jackson retire upon washington illustration map second battle of bull run jackson have now option of falling back allowing enemy to pas of withstanding whole federal army with own little force until lee came up to rescue chose latter course took up strong position sound of firing at thoroughfare gap be audible knew that longstreet division of lee army be hotly engaged with force now that be too late have be sent to hold gorge be nearly sunset before pope brought up men to attack jackson did not stand on defensive rushed down attacked enemy whose object have be to pas position press on with such vigor at nine o'clock fell back hour later horseman rode up with news that longstreet have passed gap be pressing on at full speed in morning force be seen approaching line be taking bringing up at angle to jackson position thus formation a arrived be that of open v be through angle of v that pope have to force way before longstreet must arrive however enemy hurled upon jackson for hour confederate held own against vast federal army longstreet force being too far away to lend hand ammunition failed soldier fought with pile of stone night fell without impression being made upon veteran general lee now came up with general hood division hurled against federal drove back in evening longstreet force took up position general lee have assigned to in morning confederate army have arrived battle recommenced struggle be long terrible by nightfall attack have be repulsed confederate advancing on side drove northerner broken confused crowd before darkness alone saving from utter destruction have there be one hour more of daylight defeat must have be a complete a be that in battle of bull run have be fought on precisely same ground however under cover of darkness federal retreated to centreville whence be driven on following day in tremendous fighting in jackson command have for three long day be engaged cavalry bore comparatively small part federal artillery be too powerful to permit employment of large body of cavalry although from time to time charge be made when opportunity seemed to offer battle be fought out by infantry artillery when end came jackson command be for time hors de combat during long two day march have at least gathered corn apple to sustain life during three day fighting have have food whatever many be so weak that must no longer march have done be possible for men to do have for two day withstood attack of enemy of five time number have on final day borne full share in great struggle now greater part must do more thousand of men be unable to drag step further be army be reduced in strength for time by nearly men afterward rejoined a soon a recovered limped away to take place in rank again others made way to depot at warrenton where lee have ordered that unable to accompany force must rendezvous until returned be able to rejoin regiment jackson marched away laid siege to harper ferry important depot garrisoned by men who be forced to surrender just a mcclellan with fresh army strong be pressing forward to succor arrived within day march a soon a jackson have taken place hurried away with troop to join lee who be facing enemy at antietam river here upon following day terrible battle be fought confederate though strong repulsing attack by federal driving with terrible slaughter back across river own loss however have be very heavy lee knowing that must expect assistance while enemy be constantly receiving re enforcement waited for day to collect wounded bury dead send store artillery to rear then retired unpursued across rappahannock thus hard fought campaign came to end vincent wingfield be not with army retired across rappahannock portion of cavalry have followed broken federal to very edge of stream just a reined in horse round shot from one of federal battery carried away cap fell a if dead from horse during night of northerner crossed stream to collect bring back own wounded who have fallen near coming across vincent finding that still breathed be apparently without wound carried back with across river a prisoner vincent have indeed escaped without wound having be only stunned by passage of shot have carried away cap missed by fraction of inch have begun to recover consciousness just a captor came up action of carrying completely restored that have fallen into hand of northerner be well aware be unable to imagine how have happened remembered that confederate have be up to moment fell completely successful must only imagine that in subsequent attack federal have turned table upon how have fallen what have happened to have idea beyond strange feeling of numbness in head be conscious of injury must only imagine that horse have be shot under that must have fallen upon head thought that favorite horse be killed afflicted almost a much a own capture a soon a captor perceived that prisoner consciousness have returned at once reported that officer of stuart cavalry have be taken at daybreak next morning general mcclellan on rising be acquainted with fact vincent be conducted to tent be unwounded sir general said in surprise be general vincent replied know how happened believe that horse must have be shot under must have be thrown stunned however remember nothing from moment when word halt just a reached side of stream to when found being carried here belong to cavalry yes sir be lee force engaged yesterday know vincent said only came up with jackson division from harper ferry evening before need not have questioned mcclellan said know that lee whole army strong opposed yesterday vincent be silent be glad to see that federal general a usual enormously overrated strength of force opposed to hear that whole of garrison of harper ferry be released on parole not to serve again during war if be ready to give promise to same effect will allow to return to friend if not must remain prisoner until be regularly exchanged must do so then general vincent said quietly must not remain home remain inactive while man in south be fighting for defense of country so will take chance of being exchanged be sorry choose that alternative mcclellan said hate to see brave men imprisoned if only for day braver men than across yonder stream be not to be found officer men be astonished seem so thin worn a to be scarce able to lift musket clothes be fit only for scarecrow be indeed pitiful object to look at way in fight be wonderful must not have believed have not seen that men must have charged a did again again across ground swept by tremendous artillery musketry fire be wonderful can tell young man even though beat be proud of a countryman believe that if general jackson be to ride through camp must be cheered a lustily heartily by men a be by own fifty sixty other prisoner have be taken have be captured in hand to hand struggle have taken place on part of field having got separated from corp mixed up with enemy carried off field with a retired for most part accepted offered parole fifteen like vincent preferred northern prison to promising to abstain from fighting in defense of country in middle of day be placed together in tent under guard at rear of camp next morning came news that lee have fallen back there be exultation among federal not unmingled with strong sense of relief for heavy loss inflicted in previous fighting have taken ardor of attack out of mcclellan army be glad indeed that be not to be called upon to make attempt to drive confederate from position vincent be le pleased at news knew how thin be rank of confederate fighting men how greatly be worn exhausted by fatigue want of food that although have day before repulsed attack of mass of well fed northerner such tremendous exertion must not often be repeated defeat with river in rear approachable only by one rough narrow road must have meant total destruction of army next morning vincent companion be put into train sent to alexandria have reason to complain of treatment upon way be well fed after starvation diet for last six week ration seemed to actually luxurious federal troop in alexandria who be for most part young recruit who have just arrived from north west looked with astonishment upon thin ragged men several of whom be barefooted be possible that such scarecrow a must in battle have driven back well fed cared for northern soldier be like one burly young soldier from western state asked guard be sir sergeant in charge of party replied not much to look at be by gosh must see fight must think of look then if be soldiering young farmer said solemnly sooner be back home again better seem to altogether strange a must fight so hard because must say must look upon a comfort to be killed rather than to live like shout of laughter from prisoner showed young rustic that object of pity did not consider life to be altogether intolerable even under such circumstance moved away meditating on discomfort of war upon remark must be made be to return home in so sorrowful plight a of confederate prisoner bargained to fight said though expect will like sha draw back when time come a to being starved till be nigh skeleton going about barefooted in such rag a tramp must look at aint reasonable yet have known among fifteen prisoner more than half be possessor of wide estate have be brought up from childhood in midst of luxury such a young farmer never dreamed of among many of soldier sympathy took more active form men pressed forward gave packet of tobacco cigar other little present to while two three pressed roll of dollar note into hand with word of rough kindness there aint ill feeling in reb have done work like men doubt think cause be right just a doe be over now maybe turn will come next to see inside of one of prison down south so be just soldier together can feel for other discipline in small matter be never strictly enforced in american army sergeant in charge offered opposition to soldier mingling with prisoner a walked along two day later be sent by railway to great prison at elmira in state of new york when reached jail prisoner be separated vincent who be only officer being assigned quarter with twenty others of same rank prisoner crowded round a entered eager to hear last news from front for have heard from guard only news of constant victory won by northerner for defeat be transformed by northern paper into brilliant victory be only when shattered remains of various army returned to alexandria to be re formed that truth gradually leaked out thus antietam have be claimed a great northern victory for although mcclellan troop have in battle be hurled back shattered broken across river two day afterward lee have retired one of prisoner who be also dressed in cavalry uniform hung back from rest going to window looked out while vincent be chatting with others presently turned round vincent recognized with surprise old opponent jackson after moment hesitation walked across room to jackson said have not be friend lately see why must keep up quarrel longer got on right at school together now be prisoner together here must be foolish to continue quarrel perhaps be somewhat to blame in affair be quite willing to allow be for one think might well put aside now jackson hesitated then took hand vincent held out to be right young fellow one of other officer said now that southern gentleman be fighting giving life if need be for country one have right to have private quarrel of own life be short enough a be certainly too short to indulge in private animosity few week ago be fighting side by side facing death together to day be prisoner week hence may be exchanged soon take place in rank again be duty of southerner to stand shoulder to shoulder there ought to be such thing a ill feeling among vincent be not previously aware that jackson have obtained commission now learned that have be chosen by comrade to fill vacancy caused by death of officer in skirmish just before pope fell back from rappahannock that have be made prisoner few day afterward in charge against greatly superior body of federal cavalry great majority of officer on side be at commencement of war chosen by comrade election at first taking place once year however be found to act very badly in case best men in regiment be chosen too often men who have command of money must afford to stand treat get in supply of food spirit be elected evil of system be found so great indeed that be gradually abandoned in case of vacancy occurring in field there being necessity for at once filling up colonel of regiment have power to make appointment if choice of men be considered to be satisfactory nominee must be generally chosen in case of jackson colonel have hesitated in confirming choice of men did not for moment suspect to be wanting in courage regarded a one who shirked work who won vote of men rather by fluent tongue by violence of expression of hatred against north than by soldierly quality of officer have be month in prison be highly indignant at delay have occurred in effecting exchange south indeed must have be only too glad to get rid of of numerous prisoner who be simply expense trouble to to get own men back into rank must ill spare soldier required to guard so large number of prisoner supply of food be in serious matter thus be at harper ferry upon good many other occasion released vast number of prisoner on simple parole not to serve again north however be in hurry to make exchange moreover hand be so full with enormous preparation that put aside matter have not claim of urgency chapter x escape discipline in prison at elmira be not rigorous prisoner have to clean up cell hall yard rest of time must spend a liked of whose friend have money be able to live in comparative luxury to assist who have such resource for throughout war there be never great difficulty in passing letter to from south line of frontier be enormous be only at certain point hostility be actively carried on consequently letter newspaper be freely passed money must be sent in same way from one part of country to at certain hour of day hawker vender of such article a be in most demand by prisoner be allowed to enter yard to sell ware to confederate spirit be not allowed to be carried in tobacco kind of food be permitted to pas vincent have at alexandria written letter to mother have given to man who represented that made business to forward letter to agent at richmond being paid for letter sum of dollar on delivery vincent therefore felt confident that anxiety must be felt at home when learned that be among missing at battle of antietam must be relieved be fairly supplied with money have indeed have several hundred dollar with at time be captured be entirely in confederate note for got value in northern paper at alexandria found ration supplied in prison ample be able to aid of fellow prisoner in purchasing clothes to replace rag wore when captured one day vincent strolled down a usual toward gate where under eye of guard row of men woman principally negro negress be sitting on ground with basket in front of containing tobacco pipe fruit cake needle thread button variety of other article in demand while number of prisoner be bargaining joking with presently eye fell upon negro before whom be great pile of watermelon started a did so for at once recognized well known face of dan a soon a negro saw that master eye have fallen upon began loudly praising quality of fruit here massa officer here bery fine melyons ripe sweet green trash dis un good right through five cent sah bery cheap dese expect cost nothing sambo one of confederate soldier said a bought melon got neighbor patch handy eh dan grinned at joke then selecting from bottom of pile in basket offered to vincent dis fine fruit sah sure please with vincent took melon handed dan five cent momentary glance be exchanged then walked away sat down in quiet corner of yard cut open melon a expected found note rolled up in center small piece of rind have be cut out pulp removed for reception bit of rind have then be carefully replaced so that cut must not be noticed without close inspection be from one of fellow officer be dated day after capture read a follows dear wingfield be delighted afternoon to hear instead a have believed of being knocked on head be prisoner among yank several of noticed fall just a halted at river thought that from way in fell have be shot through head heart however there be time to inquire in terrific storm of shot shell in morning when burying party went down must find sign of although knew almost to foot where have fallen must only conclude at last that have be carried off in night by yank a must hardly take trouble of carrying off dead body occurred to that might after be alive so colonel went to lee who at once sent trumpeter with flag down to river to inquire be mightily pleased a may imagine when came back with news that be not only prisoner unwounded having be only stunned in way from way fell suppose round shot must have grazed head at least be only way can account for horse came back unhurt to troop will be well cared for until rejoin hope will not be long boy kept camp awake last night with howling be at present almost out of mind with delight tell have made up mind to slip across line make way a runaway to alexandria where will of course be taken in first place say be got money of yours have insisted on taking fifty dollar can repay when next meet a will not have to ask for work may escape usual lot of runaway who be generally pounced upon set to work on fortification of alexandria washington intends to find out what prison be taken to to follow with vague idea of being able to aid to escape a can not write have asked to write letter to telling what idea be will give to when find opportunity wish to give answer making suggestion may occur to a to best way of setting about say that will make acquaintance among negro north will find someone who will read note to write answer have told that if be caught at game be likely to be inside prison bit longer than be even if worse doe befall however make light of be bent upon carrying out plan can only hope will succeed have just heard that will fall back across rappahannock to morrow imagine there will not be much hard fighting again until spring long before hope will be in place among again lost twenty three men two officer ketler sumner yesterday good by old fellow need not say keep up spirit for be pretty sure to do yours truly james sinclair after first start at seeing dan vincent be scarcely surprised for have often thought over what boy must do have fancied that while if supposed dead must go straight back to orangery be quite possible must hear that be prisoner dan might take into head to endeavor to join a to making escape did not appear to be very difficult undertaking now that have friend outside watch kept up be not very vigilant one for such number of prisoner be taken on side that be not regarded a of very great importance indeed difficulty lay rather in making across country to southern border than in escaping from prison for with friend outside with disguise in readiness that matter be comparatively easy be required for adventure be long rope sharp file dark night chief difficulty occurred to vincent arose from fact that there be twenty other prisoner in same ward must hardly file through bar of window unnoticed by must naturally wish to share in flight where one person might succeed in evading vigilance of guard be unlikely in extreme that twenty must do so alarm once given must be recaptured be spared trouble of making up mind a to plan for by time have finished letter hour that huckster be allowed to sell good be passed gate be shut be quiet after thought came to conclusion that only plan must be to conceal somewhere in prison just before hour at be locked up in ward alarm must be given for list of name be called over before lock up search must of course be made still if must find good place for concealment might succeed since search after dark must not be so close minute a must be made next morning only disadvantage must be that sentry must be specially on alert a unless fugitive have succeeded in way in passing out of gate in disguise must still be within wall might attempt to scale through night certainty largely increased danger vincent went to bed night without finally determining what have better be done next morning while walking in ground determined place must choose for concealment if adopted plan have thought of evening before lower room upon one side of building be inhabited by governor officer of prison if be to spring through open window unnoticed just a became dusk hide in cupboard under bed there must be safe for time a however close search might be in other part of building must be scarcely suspected at rate on first alarm that have concealed in officer quarter there must of course be chance of being detected a got out of window again at night must not be great risk be vigilance of sentry that most feared possibility that a soon a fact of being missing be known cordon of guard might be stationed outside wall in addition to in yard danger appeared to to be so great that be half inclined to abandon enterprise must certainly be weary work to be shut up there for perhaps year while friend be fighting battle of country must be better after to put up with than to run extreme risk of being shot when arrived at conclusion went to room to write line to dan day be fine one found that whole of occupant of room have gone below be unexpected bit of good fortune at once went to window examined bar be thick of new iron have be hastily put up building have originally be large warehouse when have be converted into prison for confederate prisoner bar have be added to window instead therefore of being built into solid stone fastened in by lead be merely screwed on to wooden framework of window by strong screw driver bar must be removed in five minute altogether altered position have only to wait until rest of occupant of room be asleep then to remove bar let down at once wrote want twenty yard of strong string same length of rope will bear weight also strong screw driver when have got will let know night hour will want disguise ready to put on folded note up into small compass at hour at dan must be about to enter sauntered down to gate in short time vender entered be soon busy selling ware dan have a before basket of melon vincent made way up to want melon said a good a that sold last night dey de same sah first rate melyons dese just melt away in mouf like honey held up one of melon vincent placed in hand copper in payment between two of have placed little note dan hand closed quickly on coin dropping into pocket addressed next customer while vincent sauntered away again time melon be whole one vincent divided with couple of other prisoner for fruit be too large for one person to consume being quite a large a man head next day melon be bought time vincent did not open in public examining closely perceived that have be cut through middle doubt contained portion of rope hesitated a to next step if took melon up to room must be sure to find men there must be naturally called upon to divide fruit yet there be nowhere else must hide for long time sat with back to wall melon beside abusing for folly in not having told dan to send rope in small length that must hide about place where have sat down be one of quietest in yard men be constantly strolling up down determined at last that only possible plan be in first place to throw coat over melon to tuck up underneath then to get hold of one end of ball of rope that doubtless contained to endeavor to wind round body without being observed be risky business must gladly have tossed melon over wall have dared to do so for if be detected not only must be punished with much more severe imprisonment dan might be arrested punished most severely unfortunately weather be by mean hot must look strange to take off coat besides if did so how must coil rope round without being observed so that idea be abandoned got up walked to angle in wall there sat down again concealing melon a well a must between wall when anyone happened to come near pulled half apart found a have suspected be shell whole of fruit having be scooped out gave exclamation of pleasure on seeing instead a feared of large ball of rope being inside interior be filled with neatly made hank containing several yard of thin strong rope together with hank of strong string unbuttoning coat thrust in then took melon rind broke into very small piece threw about then went up to room thrust hank unobserved one by one among straw covered by army blanket constituted bed to morrow doubt dan must supply somehow with screw driver on going down to gate next day found that negro have changed commodity that time basket contained very large fine cucumber be selling briskly vincent saw that dan be looking round anxiously that expression of relief came over face a perceived have indeed eight ten cucumber left cucumber to day sah bery fine cucumber first rate cucumber dese look rather over ripe vincent said not bit sah dey just ripe dis bery fine one ten cent dis be putting up price darky be making fortune out of vincent said a took cucumber be very large straight one have difficulty with a with melon sharp twist broke in two a reached corner have used day previously have be cut in one end have be scooped out for reception of handle of screw driver metal be driven in to head in other half hiding under jacket felt that be now prepared for escape now asked whether must go alone take one more of comrade into confidence finally determined to give young virginian officer named geary with whom have be specially friendly during imprisonment jackson chance of escape did not like latter thought that after reconciliation have taken place between be only right to take rather than stranger drawing aside then told that have arranged mode of escape be impossible that must avail of that be welcome to accompany thanked heartily for offer when explained manner in intended to make off agreed to try fortune with propose said a soon a be fairly beyond prison separate try to gain frontier a best can fact that three prisoner have escaped will soon be known over country there must be chance whatever for if kept together will tell boy to have three disguise ready when once put aside uniform see reason why traveling separately suspicion must fall upon ought to have difficulty until at rate arrive near border there must be plenty of point where can cross without going anywhere near federal camp others at once agreed that chance of making way separately be much greater than if together being arranged vincent passed note next day to dan telling to have three disguise in readiness to be at foot of western wall halfway along at twelve o'clock on first wet night string must be thrown over with knife fastened to be to pull on string till rope came into hand to hold tight until be over vincent chose spot because be equally removed from sentry box at corner of yard because there be stone seat in yard to one end of rope must be attached that night be fine next be thick misty at nine o'clock be in bed lay listening to clock in distance ten struck eleven when thought be approaching twelve got up crept to window be joined immediately by others screw driver be set to work a expected vincent found trouble with screw be not yet rusted in wood turned immediately when powerful screw driver be applied to when be out bar be carefully lifted from place laid upon floor rope be then put round one of other bar drawn through until two end came together be then dropped to ground below geary went first jackson followed vincent be soon standing beside taking one end of rope pulled until other passed round bar fell at foot three be barefooted stole noiselessly across yard to seat be nearly opposite window vincent have already fastened clasp knife to end of string now threw over wall be about twenty foot high have tied knot at forty foot from end standing close to wall drew in string until knot be in hand two yard knew that knife be hanging yard from ground against wall now drew up down hoping that slight noise knife made against wall might aid dan in finding in two three minute felt jerk knew that dan have got fastened end of string to rope waited rope be gradually drawn up when neared end fastened to stone seat now said up go geary order in be to ascend have be settled by lot a geary insisted that vincent who have contrived whole affair must be first to escape vincent declined to accept advantage three have accordingly tossed up for precedence geary be quickly over lowered on opposite side others followed safely not without good deal of scraping against wall for smallness of rope added to difficulty of climbing however noise be so slight that have little fear of attracting attention especially a sentry must be standing in box for rain be now coming down pretty briskly a soon a be down vincent seized dan by hand brave boy said owe freedom sha forget now where be clothes here dey be sah one be rough suit like working man be black white sort of suit check suit de oder one be for clargy suit sir make very nice young minister for sure right dan vincent said laughing give minister suit then will be countryman geary said there be little suppressed laughter a changed clothes in dark then leaving uniform by wall shook hand started at once in different direction lest might come across someone who

for outside prison there be not ten people who knew face throughout northern state must be difficult for to make way down into virginia from north a whole line of frontier there be occupied by troop patrol be on watch night day to prevent person from going through line therefore determined to go west to st louis from there work way down through missouri after two day railway traveling reached st

be thus enabled to slide down on other side uniform be found lying at foot of wall accomplice have doubtless have disguise ready for authority of prison be unable to account for manner in screw driver rope be passed in to how communicated with friend outside then followed personal description of of fugitive request that loyal citizen must be on lookout for must at once arrest suspicious character unable to give satisfactory account of a vincent sat smoking in hall of hotel heard several present discussing escape of prisoner doe not matter about one way other one of speaker said seem to be mere boy whether escape not will not make difference to anyone serious thing be that there must be traitor among prison official that next time perhaps two three general may escape must be really serious misfortune need not reckon that out at present smoker said have got three of rebel general yet a far a thing seem to be going on may have to wait time before have be pretty well able to take care of

two revolver sounded a if have only be waiting for signal score of other men leaped up sprang at other have a altercation grew hotter joined in with exclamation of anger approval vincent saw that although unionist be majority party of sympathizer with south be strong one having arm inclination to join in broil of kind made escape into street instant hostility began hurried away from sound of shout oath sharp crack of pistol breaking of glass ten minute later returned hotel be shut up angry mob be assembled round door shouting down with rebel down with secessionist be keeping up loud knocking at door presently window upstairs opened proprietor put out head gentleman said can assure that person who be cause of disturbance left hotel by back way a soon a affair be over have sent for police commissioner upon arrival will be free to search house to arrest anyone concerned in affair crowd be not satisfied renewed knocking at door two three minute later officer with strong body of

confederate officer who be trying to escape in disguise of clergyman that have therefore tried to arrest must of course give ground for accusation still question might be asked must be impossible for to answer however plausible story might invent lawyer whom fellow must doubtless employ to defend might suggest that truth of statement might be easily tested by dispatch of telegram in case must be

up north again vincent heard more be enough to show that sharp hunt be being kept up for although have fear of being caught in wood be well pleased at thought that must soon be across water beyond reach of enemy went back again to edge of clearing resumed watch be just getting dusk be about to join dan when saw party of twelve men ride out from other side of wood make toward house filled with

a if must do with great deal of sort of thing will see that will become impatient for move before do will see sir anyhow be glad have said that because now whatever may feel will keep impatience to yourself four week passed by smoothly pleasantly dan went into village once week to do shopping doctor have reduced visit to same number must have come oftener for visit to lonely cottage amused feared that frequent passage in buggy might attract notice so far one else have broken solitude of life if doctor call have be noticed neighbor have not taken trouble to see who have settled in jenkins old place visit be very welcome for brought newspaper book former being also purchased by dan whenever went into village thus learnt course of event outside since antietam nothing have be done in northern virginia burnside who have succeeded mcclellan be preparing great army be to march to richmond crush out rebellion lee be standing on defensive along whole line of frontier from new orleans to tennessee desultory fighting be going on in conflict confederate have generally worse of thing having there general such a lee jackson longstreet who have made army of virginia almost invincible at last of visit doctor told vincent that considered be nearly sufficiently restored in health to be able to start on journey at one time be almost afraid that shoulder must never be quite square again however a can see for have come out quite right although must not advise to put great strain on left arm believe that in very short time will be a strong a other now doctor how much be in debt to kindness can not be repaid medical bill will discharge a soon a get home have not more than twenty dollar left be little enough for journey there be before can rely that instant get to richmond will send money there be great difficulty in smuggling letter across frontier be very pleased to have be able to be of service to doctor said must not think of accepting payment for aid rendered to officer of army will give real pleasure to receive letter saying have reached home in safety be duty to do can for brave men fighting for cause a have told be not very hot partisan for see fault on side still believe in principle of forefather that state have own government be master of own army joining with others for such purpose a may think fit if have be fighting man must certainly have joined army of state a be hope can do more good by staying giving such aid comfort a can to countryman will be sure excuse saying that think must let aid little farther understand to say that miss kingston will go to friend in georgia suppose will see safely there then have considerable journey to make to richmond sum that posse be utterly inadequate for will give real pleasure if will accept loan of hundred dollar can repay when write to from richmond will need money for sake of companion rather than own when have once crossed line will then be able to appear in proper character vincent grasped doctor hand with suffused eye replied thank greatly doctor will accept offer a frankly a be made have intended telegraphing for money a soon a be among own people there must be delay in receiving will be much more pleasant to push on at once by way can not cross at florence for hear that hood have fallen back across river force advancing against from side being too strong to be resisted think that be disadvantage to for must have be far more difficult to pas federal get to florence than to make for point on river a far a possible from contending army talked that over last time be here doctor know agreed be better to run risk of falling into hand of yankee troop than into of one of partisan band whose exploit be always performed at distance from army however if hood have retreated across tennessee there be end of plan must take other route do advise yankee will be strong around great bend of river to west of florence along line to east must of course be direct way passage however be real difficulty must say that instead of going in direction have better bear nearly due south there be road from mount pleasant strike into main road from columbia up to camden can cross river at point without question suspicion a must be merely traveling to west of state once across must work directly south crossing into state of mississippi from there take car through alabama to georgia seems roundabout way think must find far safest for there be army operating upon line population at rate a get south be for there be so far a have heard very few of bushwhacking band about on one side other difficult part of journey be that up to camden a will be going away from seat of war instead of toward there will be little risk of being questioned have thought of buying

real pain to in next place have a be given pledge to tony that must be well cared for until must be sent to join what must say now when negro wrote to claim then too felt personal injury that woman must be carried off when under mother protection be full of indignation fury at dastardly revenge taken by jackson upon hearing news have at once mentally determined to devote for time to search for dinah news that great battle be expected at front interfered with plan now that be back capable of returning to duty place be clearly with regiment determined that while must rejoin at once must a soon battle be over if be unhurt take up search mother sister be greatly distressed when at breakfast told that must at once report a fit for duty ready to join regiment be afraid must think so mr wingfield said while girl wept silently much a grieve at losing again so soon can say nothing against have gone through many danger vincent have be preserved to through will pray that may be so to end still whether not a virginia woman can not grudge son to service of country when mother be making same sacrifice be hard to give up when yesterday returned to chapter xv fredericksburg a soon a breakfast be over vincent mounted wildfire have be sent back after have be taken prisoner rode into richmond there reported at headquarters a having returned after escaping from federal prison making way through line of enemy have shoulder bone smashed in fight with yankee said be laid up in hiding for six week have now fairly recovered shoulder at time give considerable pain although be desirous of returning to duty rejoining regiment until battle at fredericksburg have taken place must request that three month leave be granted to after to return home complete cure promising of course to

pleasure in to day filling up commission a captain now let hear how made escape by account published in northern paper seemed that must have have confederate outside wall vincent gave full account of

pistol bullet in shoulder then made way on until compelled by wound to lay up for six week in lonely farmhouse near mount pleasant afterward in disguise of young farmer have made long detour across tennessee river reached georgia when do leave for front captain wingfield will be ready to start to night sir in case will trouble to come here again evening there will be fast train going through with ammunition for lee at ten o'clock will have bag of dispatch for will trouble to deliver will find here up to last moment will give order that horse box be attached to train after expressing thanks vincent took leave a left general quarter young man just alighting from horse gave shout of greeting why wingfield be good to see thought be pining again in yankee dungeon have got knocked on head crossing line where have sprung from when did arrive only got in yesterday after sundry adventure will tell about presently when did arrive from front came down few day ago on week leave on urgent family business young man laughed be going back again afternoon by four o'clock train stay till ten vincent said will go back together there be special train going through with ammunition a everything will make way for will not be long behind four o'clock likely enough may pas on way there be horse box attached to a only take one horse there will be room for yours have brought horse down harry furniss said will certainly go with by ten o'clock then can have long talk think have seen since day asked to lend boat two year ago can spare two hour now vincent asked will do very great favor if will harry furniss looked at watch be eleven o'clock now have lot of people to lunch at half past one must be back by then can manage easy enough vincent replied in two hour from time leave here can be at home be man then vincent just wait five minute have to see someone in here few minute later harry furniss came out again mounted now way vincent what be want for way be to jackson place at cedar why will tell about a ride vincent then recounted feud with jackson of up to date of purchase of dinah moore friend be aware having be present at sale now heard of attack upon young jackson by tony of disappearance of dinah moore must not be at surprised wingfield if surmise be correct that old scoundrel have carried off girl to avenge upon tony of course if must prove must be very serious offense for stealing of slave by force too be crime with very heavy penalty have cost men life before now see that have anything like positive proof however strong case of suspicion may be see what be going to say when get there be going to tell that if doe not say what have done with girl will have son arrested for treachery a soon a set foot in confederacy again treachery furniss said in surprise what treachery have be guilty of saw that be one of who escaped with rather wondered at time at two being mixed up together in anything heard that have be recaptured through black fellow have be slave did not read account have got proof of what say perhaps proof must hold in court of law vincent replied proof enough to make absolute certainty to mind vincent then gave account of escape of anonymous denunciation of dan now said one dan knew of intended escape one knew what clothes have purchased one must possibly have known be to be disguised a preacher dan a servant therefore information must have be given by jackson have not least doubt that blackguard did give wingfield there be proof consider that there be proof absolute positive proof vincent asserted because one else must have known well see that a matter of fact other officer did know might possibly have given information why must idea be absurd have never have quarrel with owed liberty to just so wingfield be a certain that be jackson a be because know circumstance see there be more absolute proof against one man than against other be true that have have quarrel with jackson two year before see have made up have become friend in prison so much so that selected from among score of others in same room to be companion of flight who know jackson can well believe guilty of act of gross ingratitude of ingratitude treachery people who know must hardly credit a possible that man must be such villain defense must set up must be that in first place there be shadow of evidence that more than other turned traitor in second place must be sure to say that accusation against confederate officer be too monstrous preposterous to be entertained for moment that doubtless negro although denies fact really chattered about doings to negro be lodging with that be through that someone got to know of disguise must wear know that be so wingfield ninety nine out of hundred white men in south must rather believe that negro have chattered than that confederate officer have be guilty of gross act of treachery ingratitude vincent be silent felt that what companion said be truth that weapon by have hoped to force elder jackson into saying what have done with dinah must probably fail in purpose old man be too astute not to perceive that there be real proof against son must therefore be unlikely at once to admit that have committed serious crime to forego revenge will try at rate said at last if refuse will publish story in paper when fellow get back from yankee land may either call out demand court of inquiry may not succeed in getting verdict from twelve white men think can convince everyone of own class that fellow did when battle be expected be over have got three month leave will move heaven earth to find woman if do jackson will either have to bolt to stand trial with prospect of ten year imprisonment if be convicted in case be not likely to have son about here again if did venture back brought action against chance of getting damage must be small one half hour ride brought to cedar dismounted at house fastening horse to portico knocked at door be opened by negro tell master vincent said that mr wingfield wish to speak to andrew jackson came to door to what do owe very great pleasure of visit mr wingfield said grimly have come to ask what have done with dinah moore whom have ground for believing have caused to be kidnaped from mother house be serious charge young gentleman andrew jackson said one will call upon to justify in law court men be not to be charged with criminal action even by young gentleman of good virginian family will be quite ready to meet there mr jackson whenever choose visit here be rather to give opportunity of escaping consequence will follow detection a author of crime for warn will bring crime home to whatever cost in time money offer be produce woman child not only will prosecution take place will remain silent concerning fact affect honor of son andrew jackson face have be perfectly unmoved during conversation until heard allusion to son then face changed visibly know nothing concerning can attack honor of son mr wingfield said with effort to speak a unconcernedly a before charge be a follows vincent said quietly be imprisoned at elmira with number of other officer among son thinking that be time for unpleasantness have be existing between to come to end offered hand accepted became friend short time afterward mode of escape offered to proved sincerity of feeling toward by offering to officer mean of sharing escape accepted once outside wall furnished with disguise have be prepared for assuming that of minister then separated going in different direction being accompanied by negro servant to whose fidelity owed escape two day afterward anonymous writer communicated to police fact have escaped in disguise of minister be accompanied by black servant fact be only known to negro two officer negro who have released be certainly not betrayer other officer must certainly have have possible motive for betraying there remains therefore only son whose hostility to be notorious who have expressed with bitterness against on many occasion among others in hearing of friend mr furniss here such being case be intention to charge before military authority with act of treachery a have said be willing to forego to keep silence a to conduct with reference to slave dinah moore if will restore child uninjured to house from caused to be taken sallow cheek of old planter have grown shade paler a listened to vincent narrative now burst out in angry tone how dare sir bring infamous accusation against son accusation like against wholly unsupported by shred of evidence doubtless negro have confided to of associate plan for assisting to escape from prison be from one of that denunciation have come go sir report where will what lie fable have invented be assured that son will seek compensation for such gross libel in court very well sir vincent said a prepared to mount horse if will take trouble to look in paper to morrow will see that threat of action for libel have effect upon man be a hard a rock wingfield furniss said a rode off together wilted little when be telling story moment saw have definite proof be a expected must be ready to defy what will do now will ride back into richmond again give full account of escape from jail state firmly believe that information a to disguise be given by jackson that be result of personal hostility a many young men in richmond be well aware have existed for time between well must do a like wingfield think will be risky business may be so vincent said have little doubt that long before jackson be exchanged will have discovered dinah will prosecute jackson for theft kidnaping in case young man will hardly venture to prosecute indeed to show face in part of country evening two young officer started for front next morning richmond paper came out with sensational heading alleged gross act of treachery ingratitude by confederate officer be th of december when vincent joined army at fredericksburg reported to general stuart who received with great cordiality be just in time wingfield said believe that in twenty four hour battle will be fought have for last two day be moving about in front apparently want to believe that intend to cross somewhere below town news get from spy be to effect that be only feint that intend to throw bridge across here know anyhow have got two train concealed opposite near river burnside be likely to find hard nut to crack of course be superior in number to a always be a have always beat well on level ground think chance of getting up height be by mean hopeful then too change of commander be against mcclellan fought drawn battle against at antietam showed really able general in operation in front of richmond army have confidence in be by far best man have got so far fool at washington have now for second time displaced because be jealous of burnside have shown good man in minor command think be equal to command vast army a besides know from friend at washington that have protested against advance across river have be overruled will see fredericksburg will add to long list of victory vincent shared tent with officer of same rank in general stuart staff sat chatting till late be still dark when be suddenly aroused by outbreak of musketry down at river general be right captain longmore vincent companion exclaimed be evidently throwing bridge across river fire hear come from two regiment of mississippian who be posted down in town under barksdale be work of minute to throw on clothes hurry out night be dark heavy fog hung over river roar of musketry came up from valley drum bugle be sounding all along crest at same moment issued out general stuart came out from tent be close by be that longmore jump on horse ride down to town bring back news of what be going on few minute later officer rode up wood have be thrown on fire by light vincent recognized stonewall jackson have news for asked not yet have sent officer down to inquire enemy have be trying to bridge river suppose so jackson replied have ordered one of brigade to come to head of bank a soon a can be formed up to help barksdale if need be want to take down into town be commanded by hill on opposite side know have brought up also artillery there in few minute captain longmore returned enemy have thrown two pontoon bridge across one above one below old railway bridge mississippian have driven back once be pushing on work will soon get finished general barksdale bid report that with force at command can repulse attempt to cross light be now breaking in east roar of musketry continued under canopy of fog general lee longstreet others have now arrived upon spot vincent be surprised that order be issued for troop to re enforce under general barksdale presently sun rose a gained in power fog slowly lifted be seen that two pontoon bridge be complete fire of mississippian be so heavy that although enemy several time attempted to cross recoiled before suddenly gun be fired from opposite height at signal more than hundred piece of artillery opened fire upon town many of inhabitant have left a soon a musketry fire began slope behind soon presented sad spectacle men woman child poured out from town bewildered with din terrified by storm of shot shell crashed into higher higher crowd of fugitive made way until reached crest among be weeping woman cry child many of in scantiest attire carrying such article of dress valuable a have caught up when startled by terrible rain of missile in very few minute smoke began to rise over town followed by tongue of flame in hour place be on fire in score of place day bombardment went on without cessation fredericksburg crumbled into ruin still in spite of terrible fire mississippian clung to burning town amid crashing wall falling chimney shell exploding in direction a night fell enemy poured across bridge barksdale contesting foot of ground fell back through burning city took up position behind stone wall in rear throughout day not single shot have be fired by confederate artillery be very inferior in power to of enemy a general lee have wish finally to hinder passage of federal stubborn resistance of barksdale force being only intended to give time to concentrate army a soon a knew for certain point at enemy be going to cross did not wish therefore to risk destruction of of battery by calling down federal fire upon during day troop be brought up into position longstreet be on left jackson on right while gun forty seven in number be in readiness to take up post in morning on slope in front of on extreme right general stuart be posted with cavalry horse artillery night passed quietly by daybreak troop be drawn up in position a soon a sun rose be seen that during night enemy have thrown more bridge across that greater portion of army be already over be indeed already in movement against confederate position attack being directed toward portion of line held by jackson division general stuart gave order to major pelham who commanded horse artillery who immediately brought up gun began battle by opening fire on flank of enemy gun of northern battery at once replied for hour artillery duel continued federal gun doing heavy execution for time attack be threatened from various point about ten o'clock when fog lifted mass of troop advanced against jackson be suffered to come within eight hundred yard before gun be fired then fourteen gun opened upon with such effect that fell back in confusion at one o'clock attempt be made covered by tremendous fire of artillery for time column of attack be kept at bay by fire of confederate battery advanced with great resolution pushed way through jackson first line forced to fall back jackson brought up second line drove enemy back with great slaughter until advance be checked by fire of northern artillery day fight went on federal attempting to crush confederate artillery by weight of fire in order that infantry column might again advance although outnumbered by more than two to one confederate gun be worked with great resolution day passed darkness began to fall without retiring from position have taken up just at sunset general stuart ordered battery on right to advance did opened fire on northern infantry with such effect that fell back to position near town that have occupied in morning on left equally terrible battle have raged day here northern troop be compelled to cross open ground between town base of hill suffered so terribly from fire that never succeeded in reaching confederate front throughout day confederate held position with such ease that general lee considered affair a nothing more than demonstration in force to feel position expected even sterner battle on following day jackson first second line composed of le than men have repulsed without difficulty division of franklin hooker strong while longstreet with about same force have never be really pressed by enemy although on side have force of over men in morning northern army be seen drawn up in battle array a if to advance for fresh assault movement be made general burnside be in favor of fresh attack general commanding various division felt that troop after repulse day before be not equal to work be unanimously of opinion that second assault must not be attempted after remaining for hour in order of battle fell back into town two day later whole army recrossed rappahannock river loss of confederate be men who be for most part killed wounded by enemy artillery while federal loss be le than general burnside soon afterward resigned command general hooker officer of same politics a president adviser be appointed to succeed cavalry have not be called upon to act during day vincent duty be confined to carrying order to commander of various battery of artillery posted in part of field a have be placed under general stuart order have many narrow escape by shot fragment of shell passed through day uninjured general lee have be blamed for not taking advantage of victory falling upon federal on morning after battle although such assault might possibly have be successful be conscious of immense inferiority in force troop must have be compelled to have advanced to attack across ground completely swept by fire of magnificently served northern artillery posted upon commanding height be moreover ignorant of full extent of loss have inflicted upon enemy expected renewed attack by be therefore doubtless unwilling to risk result of victory have gained of victory expected to gain must enemy renew attack by movement might not be successful must at rate have cost tremendous loss of men men be already becoming scarce in confederacy a soon a enemy have fallen back across river be certain that there be little chance of forward movement on part for considerable time vincent showed to general stuart permit have received to return home until spring on leave at once received general permission to retire from staff for time have not be accompanied by dan on railway journey to front having left behind with instruction to endeavor by mean to find clew a to direction in dinah have be carried off

mother said after first greeting be very anxious when news came that great battle have be fought last friday when heard next morning enemy have be repulsed so easily be not so anxious although be not until morning that list of killed wounded be published mind set at rest mother be tremendous artillery battle be little more than at least on side have never heard anything at like from sunrise to sunset after artillery fire be more frightening than dangerous except at comparatively close quarter enemy must have fired at least fifty shot for man be hit counted several time there be fully hundred shot minute think lessened much whole day must think must have fired two three hundred round at least from gun roar be incessant what with din made reply of own artillery bursting of shell rattle of musketry din at time be almost bewildering wildfire be hit with piece of shell fortunately be not very large one be not much worse for shock knocked off leg of course went down with thought for moment have be hit be by far most hollow affair have have enemy fought obstinately enough without slightest spirit dash only once did get up anywhere near line then went back good deal quicker

up go wherever may lead well will spare for vincent a know did not like mixing up in business two year ago be altogether different now woman be very willing well conducted have got to be really fond of putting that aside be intolerable that piece of insolence a stealing of one of slave must go unpunished therefore if do find clew to affair will not grumble at following up even if doe take away from home for short time by bye have letter morning from certain young lady in georgia inclosing photograph rather fancy there be one for somewhere where be mother vincent asked jumping from seat let think mr wingfield replied did either of girl put away where can have be stowed girl laughed now vincent what offer do make for letter well wo tease annie went on a vincent gave impatient exclamation

dinah by bye vincent mr wingfield remarked next morning at breakfast have parted with pearson be glad to hear what did discover at last that be scamp several thing occurred shook confidence in vincent account be not at satisfactory happened quite accidentally that when be talking one day with mr robertson who a know be great speculator in tobacco said must grow more tobacco a really fetched nothing replied that must be pity to give up for so little be now cultivated that price be rising orangery tobacco always fetched top price think price paid for crop year must at rate have paid for labor be to say paid for keep of slave something over then mentioned price have given be certainly good deal higher than have imagined looked at account next morning found that pearson have only credited with one third of amount must have received so at once dismissed indeed have be thinking of doing so little time before for money be so scarce price of produce so low that felt must not afford to pay a much a have be giving be afraid have be drawing rather heavily mother vincent put in have plenty of money vincent since father death have have much le company than before have not spent income besides have considerable sum invested in house property other security have of course since war began be subscribing toward expense of war for support of hospital so on thought at time like ought to keep expense down to lowest point to give balance of income to state how did jonas take dismissal mother not very pleasantly mr wingfield replied especially when told that have discovered be robbing however knew better than to say much for have not be in good odor about here for time after fighting near here there be report that have be in communication with yankee spoke to about at time a be mere matter of rumor originating doubt from fact that be northern man by birth paid attention to be likely enough to be true vincent said always distrusted vehemence with took confederate side how

place get hold of negro slave worf thousand dollar dat quite clear not do arrange wid oder fellow stop quiet at de hotel for two day after gone so dat one can bepect having hand in de affair be just how make out dan now have gone off to join dan thought for time perhaps dey join thar sah perhaps not perhaps send baggage on there get out somewhere on de road meet dem be likely enough dan doubt dinah be taken away in cart buggy a left two day before did may have gone from forty to sixty mile along road to place where may have joined men who carried off may either have come back gone on with if wanted to go south must go on if did not must probably have only hired to carry off hand over to when overtook will look at time table see where train stop be fast train see after consulting stop at petersburg fifteen mile on at hick ford be about fifty mile must think second place be most likely a cart must easily have gone there in two day now dan have better start to morrow morning spend two day there if necessary find out if can if on th of last month anyone noticed vehicle of kind with two rough looking men in with perhaps negro woman might not have be noticed for may have be lying tied up in bottom of cart although be more likely frightened by threat into sitting up quiet with be sure not to have stopped at decent hotel will have gone to small place probably just outside town will go with to mr renfrew first thing in morning get to draw up paper testifying that be engaged in lawful business be making inquiry with view to discovering crime have be committed recommending to assistance of police in town may go to then if go with to head constable at hick ford will tell be place at such fellow a must have be likely to put up for night perhaps send policeman with to make inquiry if get news telegraph to at once will start by six o'clock train on following morning do be on platform to meet can then either go straight on to florence must there be occasion will get out there think be likely pearson will to certainty sooner later go to florence to get luggage only real advantage will get if inquiry be successful will be to find out for certain whether be concerned in affair will then only have to follow trace from florence two day later mr renfrew received telegram from head constable at hick ford two men with cart spent day here th ult be joined that morning by man negro say pearson one man returned afternoon richmond pearson other drove off in buggy young negress child be with be there anything can do mr renfrew telegraphed back to request that men who be

best of time pretty rough lot at edge of carolina swamp at present thing be likely to be worse than usual if be to go alone on such errand must almost certainly be shot in first place fellow must not give up valuable slave without struggle in next place have committed very serious crime therefore be absolutely necessary that must go armed with legal power backed by force of law in first place will draw up affidavit sign to effect that female slave property of vincent wingfield have with male child be kidnaped stolen by jonas pearson others acting in association with that have reason to know that have be conveyed into south carolina will get witnessed by justice of peace will then take up to state house there will get usual official request to governor of south carolina to issue order that aid of law will be given to in recovering said dinah moore child arresting abductor will obtain order to effect from governor armed with will a soon a have discovered where woman be call upon sheriff of county to aid in recovering in arresting pearson associate thank sir will certainly be best way run plenty of risk in doing duty a officer of state have desire to throw life away at hand of ruffian such a pearson ally two hour later vincent received from mr renfrew official letter to governor of south carolina at six o'clock next morning started for florence on platform of station at hick ford dan be waiting for jump into car at end dan will come to there can tell news be going straight on to columbia now dan vincent went on when joined for in part of united state be negro allowed

bepose dat oder man went back to richmond again be right dan have done capitally now at florence will take up hunt be long way down there if drive way a hope will will take fortnight so that will have gained good deal of time on people at station be sure to remember three box lay there for so long without being claimed of course may have driven only till got fairly out of reach then may either have sold horse cart fellow pearson have with may have driven back must think must most likely sell in case must not be more than week from time left richmond to time took train again for south however whether have got fortnight three week start of will not make much difference with description can give of pearson fact that there be negress child three box ought to be able to trace be twelve at night when train arrived at florence a nothing must be done until next morning vincent went to hotel a soon a railway official be likely to be at office be at station again tip of dollar secured

florence went down at once to charleston here after twenty four hour delay obtained warrant for arrest of jonas pearson others on charge of kidnaping then returned to florence found that railway man have failed in obtaining information a to cart concluded must have come in from country on purpose to meet train at rate vincent said must be within pretty limited range of country railway make bend from wilmington to place then down to charleston so be really nearest station to only small extent of country be so railway man said have heard from dan good deal about case have got thoroughly interested in marion kingstree must be nearer one way other to most of swamp country so ca be a far a conwayborough on north georgetown on south must lie somewhere between jeffries creek lynch creek anyhow must be in marion county be pretty nigh sure so if be must take rail back to marion courthouse see sheriff there have talk over matter with have got much to go upon because man be after have be away from here good many year wo be known besides likely enough went by other name down here anyhow sheriff can put up to road best way of going about job think must be best way vincent said will be

altogether there may be two three hundred little plantation scattered about big little have got anything to guide in slightest not thing a can see man who be working under pearson when be with told have got notion that have have to leave on account of trouble here possibly that might afford clew might do so sheriff said when did come to think be when be six seven year old must be about twelve thirteen year ago of course may not have come direct to after leaving here can look anyway sheriff said opening chest took out number of volume containing record of predecessor twelve year ago well be

stranger have arrived there lately of course pearson will not have kept that name will not have appeared a john porter for must be arrested on fresh warrant at once for share in former business think

to do by man knew in richmond a pearson who told that wanted to aid in carrying off slave woman who be really property have be fraudulently taken from have heard say that there be interested in affair who have own reason for getting woman out of way have paid handsomely for job who that other be pearson have never mentioned vincent saw that have absolute evidence against jackson therefore purposely suppressed fact that pearson be among killed in hope that paragraph must so alarm jackson that must at once decamp anticipation be entirely justified for upon day of return to richmond saw notice in paper that cedar with field hand house belonging to be for sale proceeded at once to estate agent learned from that jackson have come in two day before have informed that sudden important business have called away that be starting at once for new york where presence be urgently required that must attempt to get through line immediately have asked what thought property slave must fetch being acquainted with estate have given rough estimate have upon jackson giving full power to sell advanced two third of sum jackson have apparently started at once indeed have told that must take next train a far north a must get vincent received news with great satisfaction have little doubt that jackson have really made down to south that must try to cross line there statement that intended to go direct north being merely intended to throw pursuer off track must warrant be issued against however mattered little way jackson have gone so that have left state there be little chance of ever returning for even when learned that confederate in business have be killed in fight must not be certain that prisoner who have be taken be not aware of share have in business fortnight later vincent went down into georgia brought back lucy kingston for visit to mother have already received letter from father in reply to one have written after reaching aunt protection saying how delighted be to hear that have crossed line for that have suffered greatest anxiety concerning have continually reproached for not sending away sooner said be much pleased with engagement to captain wingfield whom did not know personally of whom heard most favorable report from various virginia gentleman to whom have spoken since receipt of letter lucy remained at richmond until beginning of march when vincent took home to georgia again week after return rejoined army on rappahannock effort have be made by confederate authority to raise army of general lee to point must enable to cope with tremendous force enemy be collecting for ensuing campaign drain of men be now telling terribly lee have at utmost to oppose collected under general hooker first fight of campaign have already taken place when vincent rejoined army body of federal cavalry have crossed river on th of march at kelly ford have be met by general fitz lee with about cavalry after long stubborn conflict have be driven back with heavy loss across river be not until middle of april that enemy began to move in earnest ford be watched by stuart cavalry frequent attempt made by federal horse to push across to obtain information be always defeated on th of april general hooker preparation be complete plan of action be that men must cross river near old battlefield of fredericksburg thus lead confederate to believe that be point of attack main body be however to cross at kelly ford many mile higher up river to march down toward other force be then to recross march up river cross at kelly ford follow join main army at same time federal cavalry be very numerous well organized be under general stoneman to strike down through country toward richmond thus cut confederate communication with capital so prevent longstreet division be lying near richmond from rejoining passage of river be effected at two ford without resistance on th of april upon same day cavalry column marched south general lee directed portion of cavalry under general fitz lee to harass delay column a much a possible although have with few hundred men succeeded in doing good service in cutting off detached body of enemy capturing many officer men so demoralizing invader after pushing on a far a james river stoneman have to retreat in great haste across rapidan river hooker having crossed river marched on to chancellorsville where set to to intrench having sent word to general sedgwick who commanded force have crossed near fredericksburg to recross push round join a soon a possible chancellorsville be large brick mansion standing in midst of field surrounded by extensive forest country be known a wilderness within range of many mile there be only few scattered house dense thicket pine wood covered whole country two narrow road passed through wood crossing other at chancellorsville two other road led to ford known a ely ford united state ford a soon a reached chancellorsville hooker set troop to work cutting down tree throwing up earthwork for infantry redoubt for artillery erecting double line of defense on mounted upward of hundred piece of artillery commanding narrow road by enemy must approach for thicket be in many place so dense a to render impossible for troop to force way through when sedgwick crossed river lee drew up army to oppose finding that more troop crossed that sedgwick did not advance soon came to conclusion be not point at enemy intended to attack in twenty four hour one of stuart horseman brought news that hooker have crossed rappahannock at kelly ford rapidan at ely ford lee at once left one division to face general sedgwick ordered three others to join general anderson who with men have fallen back before hooker advance taken post at tabernacle church about halfway between fredericksburg tabernacle lee rode forward at once joined anderson jackson led force from fredericksburg pressed enemy back toward chancellorsville until approached tremendous line of fortification then fell back to communicate with lee night council of war be held be agreed that attack upon front of enemy position be absolutely impossible hooker be so positive that position be impregnable that issued general order of congratulation to troop saying that enemy must now ingloriously fly give battle on own ground where certain destruction awaits jackson then suggested that must work right round wilderness in front of enemy position march down until well on flank attack there where must be unprepared for assault movement be one of extraordinary peril lee must be left with one division in face of immensely superior force jackson must have to perform arduous march exposed to attack by whole force of enemy might be destroyed separately without being able to render slightest assistance to other at daybreak on d of may jackson mustered troop for advance have in course of night caught severe cold in hasty march have left blanket behind one of staff threw heavy cape over a lay on wet ground during night jackson woke thinking that young officer might be suffering from want of cape rose quietly spread cape over lay down without consequence be severe cold terminated in attack of pneumonia that occurring at time when be enfeebled by wound resulted in death if have not thrown that cape over officer be probable that must have survived wound at daybreak column commenced march have to traverse narrow unfrequented road through dense thicket occasionally crossing ground in sight of enemy at end to attack tremendous position held by immensely superior force stuart with cavalry moved on flank of column whenever ground be open so a to conceal march of infantry from enemy a rear of column passed spot called furnace enemy suddenly advanced cut off d georgia who be in rear of column captured whole regiment with exception of score of men at point road turned almost directly away from chancellorsville enemy believed that column be in full retreat have not least idea of real object so hour after hour troop pressed on until reached turnpike road passing east went through chancellorsville now lay exactly between point that have left in morning jackson design be to advance upon line of road to extend troop to left then to swing round cut enemy retreat to ford capture hooker have already be joined by two of sedgwick army corp have now six army corp at chancellorsville while jackson force consisted of men lee remained with at tabernacle latter general have not be attacked have continued to make demonstration against federal left occupying attention preventing from discovering how large portion of force have left be at five o'clock in evening that jackson troop having gained position advanced to attack in front of lay howard division of federal intrenched in strong earthwork covered by felled tree enemy be altogether unsuspicious of danger be not until with tumultuous cheer confederate dashed through tree attacked intrenchment that have suspicion of presence ran to arm be too late confederate rushed through obstacle climbed earthwork carried in front of capturing prisoner five gun rest of federal troop here throwing away musket gun fled in wild confusion steadily confederate pressed on driving enemy before capturing position after position until whole right wing of federal army be routed disorganized for three hour confederate continued march without check owing to denseness of wood necessity of keeping troop in line advance be slow night fell before movement must be completed one more hour of daylight whole federal army must have be cut off captured by eight o'clock darkness in forest be so complete that movement have to be stopped hour later one of saddest incident of war took place general jackson with few of staff went forward to reconnoiter a returned toward line troop in dark mistook for reconnoitering party of enemy fired killing wounding whole of general jackson receiving three ball enemy who be hundred yard distant at once opened tremendous fire with grape toward spot be time before jackson must be carried off field news that beloved general be wounded be for time kept from troop whisper gradually spread grief of soldier be unbounded for rather must have suffered disastrous defeat than stonewall jackson must have fallen general stuart assumed command general hill who be second in command having with many other

undergrowth have caught fire thick smoke mingled with of battle rendered difficult to see to breathe have one thought that of making way through tree of finding corp to be sent of delivering message finding general again think have much thought of danger whole thing be somehow so tremendous that one have thought whatever for one self be sort of terrible dream in one be possessed of single idea to get to certain place be not till at last swept across open ground down to house seemed to take distinct notice of what be going on around then for first time exulting shout of men long line advancing

vincent be not sorry for change took away from great theater of war after chancellorsville felt eager desire to take part in future battle duty must keep near home must give ample scope for display of watchfulness dash energy consequently took part in campaign commenced in first week in june tired of standing always on defensive confederate authority determined to carry out step have be so warmly advocated by jackson earlier in war might at time have brought to successful termination decided to carry war into enemy country by most strenuous effort lee army be raised to men divided into three

southern state most of confederate port have be either captured be so strictly blockaded that be next to impossible for blockade runner to get in out while capture of fort on mississippi enabled to use federal flotilla of gunboat to greatest advantage to carry army into center of confederacy still there be talk whatever of surrender on part of south indeed decree abolishing slavery still more action of north in raising black regiment excited bitterest feeling of animosity hatred determination to fight to last came of animated white man in southern state although deeply disappointed with

north be under own command to march against richmond army of west be to invade georgia march upon atlanta plan of action be simple be afterward stated by to be a follows determined first to use greatest number of troop practicable against main force of enemy preventing from using same force at different season against first one then of army possibility of repose for refitting producing necessary supply for carrying on resistance second to hammer continuously against armed force of enemy resource until by mere attrition if in other way there must be nothing left to submission be

there be hope for have be denounced a spy although lip have denounced have be silenced forever mischief have be done must give satisfactory account of thought for moment of declaring that mistake have be made felt that denial must counterbalance effect of jackson word fury too with latter have attacked must show plainly enough that assailant be absolutely certain a to identity even that there have be personal feud between then thought that if said that be son of woman in hut must bear out in assertion be not likely that must be accepted a against jackson testimony besides inquiry among neighbor must certainly lead to discovery that be speaking untruth might even involve in fate a abettor most of decided against course because must involve telling of lie vincent considered that while in disguise doing important service for country be justified in using deceit merely for purpose of saving own life that perhaps uselessly must not lie fate of course be certain be spy must be shot vincent have so often be in battlefield so often under fire from seemed that one must come alive that thought that death be at hand have not for terror posse differently circumstanced be going to die for confederacy a ten of thousand of brave men have died before rejoiced over precaution have taken a to transmission of discovery on previous day felt sure that general lee must do full justice to memory announce that have died in doing noble service to country sighed a thought of mother sister rose have be married in spring annie be engaged to officer in general beauregard staff then thought of lucy away in georgia for first time lip quivered cheek paled negro guard who have be enlisted few week be wholly ignorant of duty having once conveyed prisoner into room evidently considered that further necessity for military strictness be at end have be ordered to stay in room with prisoner instruction have be given a to conduct there accordingly placed musket in one corner of room proceeded to chatter laugh without further regarding under other circumstance carelessness must have inspired vincent with thought of escape knew that be out of question here there be federal camp round shout from negro must send hundred men in instant pursuit of there be nothing for to do to wait for end that end must assuredly come in morning from time to time door opened negro sergeant looked in apparently idea on subject of discipline be stricter than of men for made remark a to carelessness presently when looked in four soldier be standing at window watching regiment passing by on way to take share of work in trench vincent who be sitting at table happened to look up be astonished at seeing sergeant first put finger on lip then take off cap put one hand on heart gesticulate with other vincent gazed at in blank surprise then started almost sprang to foot for in yankee sergeant recognized tony moore uplifted hand of negro warned of necessity of silence negro nodded several time again put hand on heart then disappeared thrill of hope stirred vein in vincent body felt cheek flush have difficulty in maintaining passive attitude be not then utterly deserted have friend who must be sure do in power to aid be extraordinary indeed that must be tony who be now jailer yet when thought over be not difficult to understand be natural enough that must have enlisted when black regiment be raised have doubtless heard name shouted out by jackson have a vincent now remembered stepped forward a sort of volunteer when officer called for sergeant four men yes tony must doubtless do in power to save whether must be possible that must do so be doubtful at least there be hope with feeling of quiet resignation with vincent have faced what appeared to be inevitable at once disappeared be succeeded by restless longing for action brain be busy at once in calculating chance of being ordered for instant execution of sentence being postponed till following morning in latter case with question of what guard must be probably placed over how tony must set about attempt to aid to escape have general be in camp when be brought in must probably have be shot at sunset if did not return until afternoon must most likely order sentence to be carried out at daybreak in case a be officer time might be granted to prepare for death then there be question whether must be handed over to white regiment for safe keeping left in hand of black regiment have captured doubt after sentence be passed white officer of regiment must see that much stricter watch than now put over be set be not probable that must still be in charge of tony for a latter must be on duty day must doubtless be relieved in case how must manage to approach what mean must use to direct attention of sentry in direction thought over plan must adopt be in tony place first thing must be of course to make sentry drunk if possible must not be difficult task with men whose notion of discipline be so lax a of negro must be easy matter for tony to obtain spirit for be strictly prohibited in federal camp perhaps might help tony in way fortunately have small notebook with pencil in pocket a guard be still at window wrote a follows be captured by yankee so far a can see only chance of escape be to make sentry drunk bearer be absolutely to be trusted give canteen full of spirit tell have written here tore page out folded up directed to mr grossmith worley farm near union presently tony looked in again vincent held up note sergeant stepped quickly forward took then said sharply to men now den dis not keeping guard suppose door open dis fellow run away what dey say to two of keep eye on dis man suppose captain pearce come in find staring out window kick up nice bobbery thus admonished to do duty

cavalry will have got description of will be scouring whole country only chance will be to go north cross river somewhere near norfolk think sah better go on wid horse at once use wait for come along on foot find own way tony will certainly not do that will get off be taken together well think best plan will be to go straight down to river how far be away about fifteen mile woman said if get there can get hold of boat somehow cross then make straight for richmond on foot go up river in boat land in rear of line that can settle about afterward first thing be to get to river bank be not likely to meet with interruption in direction of course cavalry be on other flank will be supposed that will try to work round way to make straight through line must hardly suspect that will take to river be covered with transport storeships think be best plan woman said there be scarcely village between river be only just when cross road between petersburg williamsburg that must be likely to meet soul even in daytime there be scarce even farmhouse across section know country pretty well just stop minute will run up to wood fetch down horse there be big wood about mile away can turn in there few minute later started vincent leading horse tony carrying bundle of food cast off uniform woman led by farm road sometimes turning off to right left keeping way with certainty showed how well be acquainted with country several time must hear dull sound of body of cavalry galloping along road died away a got further into country horse have be turned loose mile from starting place vincent removed bridle saddle saying will pick up enough to feed on here for time when get tired of wood can work way out into clearing here tony hid away uniform among thick bush three walked steadily along until first tinge of daylight appeared on sky then woman stopped river be not more than mile in front of said so will say good by what will do vincent asked might be questioned a get near home be going to put up at last house passed said about three mile back know people there will take in will stop there for day two maybe then walk back so will have true story to tell be right vincent said

northern people dey talk mighty high about der love for de negro see much of in der way why sah dey be twice a scornful ob black man a de gentleman in de souf list in de army sah because dey say dey go to richmond den find dinah de boy well tony little thought when did service that must be mean of being able to save life day not much in dat sah sabe life because dey must for suah hab caught killed den save wife for den pay out dat jackson now hab killed must hab shouted for joy sah when saw hit ober de head wid de shovel saw dat dis time gib more trouble to one must hab done for bery soon sah have eye upon fust time got into battle got ball in back lucky did see not officer ob company look quite different in de uniform to what be when worked on de plantation knew wheneber see pas hang down head say to myself bey time come soon massa jackson time come bery soon den get quits be wrong to nourish revenge tony really ca blame very much a to fellow still must have blamed if have killed blamed very much be bad man treated brutally see have be already punished good deal yes knock down sah dat bery good not enough for tony be all tony see affair set friend against position became very unpleasant one then see if have be for must probably have got through to line again after have escaped with then see father out of revenge stole dinah away stole dinah tony exclaimed stopping in walk why sah hab be telling dat be safe well wid mr wingfield so be tony stole for have carried down into carolina managed to bring back be long story will tell about presently then knowledge have found dinah fear of punishment for share of taking away caused old jackson to fly from country getting le than quarter of sum estate must have fetched two three year ago be what made son turn unionist so see jackson be heavily punished for conduct to did not need for to revenge so be sah so be tony said thoughtfully yes doe seem a if dese ting came on kinder one after de oder just out ob dat flogging gabe now have got killed for just de same cause for if have be obliged to turn unionist must have be in dat dar battery at de time came dere yes see dat be so sah bee glad now did hab chance ob shooting down for must have done so for suah ef have have now reached river sun be just showing above horizon broad sheet of water be already astir steamer be making way up from mouth of river laden with store for army little tug be hurrying to fro vessel have discharged cargo be dropping down with tide while many sailing vessel lay at anchor waiting for turn of tide to make way higher up norfolk be however base from federal army drew larger portion of store a there be great convenience for landing here railway thence ran up to rear of line temporary wharf stage have be erected at point of river nearest to camp in front of petersburg here cattle much of store required for army be landed at point at vincent tony have struck river bank be somewhat low here there be snug farm with ground cultivated down to river whole country be open free from tree except where small patch have be left be in front of one of vincent tony be now standing think there be risk of pursuit now tony be not line on will be hunting question be how be to get across be too far to swim sah must think be vincent said with laugh be three four mile must say if be foot first question be where be to get boat must think that of farmhouse be sure to have boat chance be have be seized by yankee long ago still may have laid up yank must not have made much search for though must doubt take larger boat for use of troop for getting store ashore anyhow will go to next farmhouse ask will go sah tony must probably take for runaway will go there can be no danger men be away woman be sure to be loyal fancy few who be other way before will have changed mind since yank landed followed bank of river for quarter of mile then vincent walked on to small farmhouse standing on slope fifty yard from water two three child who be playing outside at once ran in upon seeing stranger moment later two woman came out be somewhat reassured when saw vincent approaching alone what be stranger one of asked do want meal have got little enough to offer what there be be welcome to yank have driven off cow pig two horse have emptied barn pulled up garden stuff stole fowl carried off bacon from beam so have got empty larder a far a bread molasses go be welcome thank vincent said be not in want of food what be in want of be boat boat woman repeated in surprise yes want to get across to other side else to get up river land between petersburg bermuda sake alive woman exclaimed what do want to do for will tell vincent replied know can trust life to woman in confederacy be one of general wade hampton officer have come through line to find out what be doing have be caught once managed to slip through hand there be possibility of making way back across country for yankee cavalry be patrolling road only chance have be of getting away by boat step right in woman said be real pleasure to to have one of officer under roof have friend with vincent said faithful negro who have helped to escape who must be hung like dog if must lay hand on bring in sir woman said hospitably have four five nigger till yank came ran away 'cause knew must either be set to work made to fight so went said must come back again when trouble be over maybe will maybe wo at first nigger about here used to look for yank coming a news got about of what happened to took from master concluded be better off where be call boy in sir call in vincent gave shout tony at once came up thank want anything to eat vincent went on a woman began to put plate on table have just have hearty meal have got enough food for three four day in bundle want boat if ca find that sailor clothes if have must keep along river down to norfolk place will be full of sailor must not be likely to be noticed there ca help in that woman said there be certainly boat laid up along shore now maria who have got boat have be taken expect johnson have got one other woman replied have small boat boy girl used to go out fishing in think yank have got that expect hid away somewhere know a must let have be close fisted woman be sarah johnson must pay for value vincent said oh well if must pay must let have say must anyhow seeing a be officer yank be after still be close be sarah johnson know a be so set on confederacy a most people tell what will do sir will go down say a stranger want to buy boat question asked be just to show where boat be hidden be to pay for take away when want must be very good plan vincent said if must mind trouble trouble be nothing said johnson place aint above mile along shore will go with until get close to house vincent said then when hear what want for boat will give money for can show where be hidden be accordingly done mr johnson after considerable amount of bargaining with vincent guide agreed to take twenty dollar for boat upon receiving money sent one of boy with to show where be hidden be in hole have be scooped out in steep bank ten foot above water edge be completely hidden from sight of anyone rowing past by small clump of bush when boy have returned to farmhouse woman took vincent to spot then went back together here tony have long talk a to whether must be better to put out at once to wait till nightfall be finally determined that be best to make immediate start boat rowed by two men must attract little attention might belong to of ship at anchor in river might be supposed to have gone on shore to fetch egg chicken with letter message see shore be in hand of yankee vincent said there will not be suspicion of boat in daytime at night might be hailed if gave answer fired upon might bring gunboat along to see what be matter think will be far best to go on boldly there be not likely to be body of federal troop on opposite shore except at fortress monroe perhaps opposite point where have got landing below petersburg once ashore will be safe peninsula opposite be covered with forest swamp will have difficulty in getting through however many troop may have across know place pretty well tony tony nodded once across sah de yank army must catch know ob lot ob hiding place broad hat will never do woman said have got blue nightcap knitted for husband be something like cap have seen sailor wear anyhow will pas at distance when take coat vest off colored flannel shirt will be just right thing will do capitally sooner be off better vincent said after heartily thanking two woman bestowing present upon of child started along shore boat be soon got into water oar put out started tide be just low now agreed to pull along at short distance from shore until turned a soon a did so vessel at anchor must be getting up sail to make up to landing place even have anyone on board noticed boat put out have be watching must have other thing to think about be time since last rowed in boat together tony about three year sah dat time when get safe away have bad fright dat day left sah came on to blow bery hard ob de men told dat dey did not tink must ever get back to shore dat made awful bad sah wish ober ober again dat hab died in de forest instead of taking off in boat trowing away life neber felt happy again sah till got letter up in canady knew have got back safe dat day have narrow squeak of tony be blown distance up be nearly swamped score of time dan quite made up mind that be up with however got through safe think soul except perhaps jackson that rascally overseer of ours who afterward have hand in carrying off wife lost life in consequence ever have suspicion have be doing more than long fishing expedition will tell about when be going through wood now think be pretty nearly dead water will begin to edge across chapter xx end of struggle vincent directed course so that while boat head be still pointing up stream be apparently moving in same direction a ship be gradually getting out to middle of river have tried to row straight across suspicion might at once have be excited in hour be in middle of stream vessel passing under full sail swept along at distance of hundred yard be hailed vincent merely waved hand continued course dare say fellow wonder what be up to tony be not likely to stop to inquire in quarter of hour will be pretty safe ah there be fellow who might interfere with added looking round do see little black thing two mile ahead of be steam launch if see making over be likely enough to come ask question have better head little more toward shore now if come to race foot be of importance up to now have be rowing in easy leisurely manner avoiding appearance of haste now bent to oar boat began to travel good deal faster through water vincent glanced over shoulder frequently at steam launch be keeping straight on in middle of channel tony evidently have noticed yet ten minute after passing ship exclaimed sharply row tony a hard a can launch have just passed that ship have changed course expect captain have called attention to be race now boat at moment launch changed course be rather more than halfway between center of channel shore launch be in center of channel three quarter of mile higher up have evidently put on steam a started to cut off boat for there be now white wave at bow think will do tony vincent said suppose can go above eight mile hour be certainly going four have more than twice a far to travel a have on board launch be evidently conscious that be likely to lose race for in few minute began to open fire with rifle fire away vincent said aint likely to hit thousand yard off have three hundred to row bullet whistled overhead none of struck water within many yard of boat launch be still four five hundred yard away when bow of boat touched shore several musket be discharged vincent tony leaped out plunged into bush came down to water edge launch sent up sharp series of whistle random shot be for time fired into bush be lucky did carry small gun in bow vincent said for though seven eight hundred yard be long range for rifle might likely enough have hit if have have gun now tony will have to be careful for whistle be doubt meant a alarm although can not tell who be will probably steam up if have force opposite bermuda will give news that two suspicious character have landed will have party out to look for dey can look a long a dey like sah ef dose slave hunter ca find people in de swamp what chance tink dose soldier have none at dey have got reward before dere eye dey wo want to be going in ober dere shoe into mud dirting dere uniform fear ob dem sah dey make a much noise when dey march in de wood a drove ob pig can hear dem quarter ob mile away tramped on through wood through mcclellan force have so painfully made way during first advance against richmond from time to time must hear noise in forest shout once twice discharge of firearm dey call dat hunting s'pose tony said scornfully kept steadily on until began to grow dark in forest be now in white oak swamp not eight mile from richmond thought better to pause until became quite dark for might be picked up by raiding party of cavalry vincent be in high spirit now that have succeeded in enterprise have escaped almost by miracle be eager to get back to richmond carry news down to general lee tony be even more anxious to push on at last after three year absence be to see wife child again reluctantly agreed to vincent proposal for

getting thing on board must therefore wait to boy susan appeared quite large craft for there be not water up at hedingham for vessel of size though have seen ship at harwich have never before put foot on anything larger than master lirriper barge susan be about forty foot long by twelve foot beam drew a skipper informed near five foot of water be entirely decked cabin in bow occupied fourteen foot in length rest be devoted to cargo descended into cabin seemed to very dark there being light save what came down through small hatchway still looked snug comfortable there be fireplace on one side of ladder by have descended on side there be two bunk one above other on other side there be locker running along entire length of cabin two must sleep on two on bunk above now young master will take two bunk on top there john lirriper will sleep on locker underneath man boy have two on other side put on top because there be side board ca fall out if roll besides bunk be rather wider than locker below if wind be fair wo have much of company because will hold on till moor alongside wharf of london if be foul there be not enough of to take against tide have to anchor on ebb then of course turn in how long do take getting from here to london ah can tell more about when see what weather be like in morning with strong fair wind have done in twenty four hour again with wind foul have taken nigh week

out more than people not being in to meal when have got something special ready after will go out with dick bring barge ashore will load up to morrow take back single handed can be done easy enough in such weather a be too much for one man if there be strong wind blowing driving over to one side other of river a john lirriper have expected daughter have prepared pile of hot cake for supper face brightened up when saw party return punctually boy have be up early have slept little night before be not sorry at eight o'clock to lie down on bed of freshly cut rush covered with home spun sheet for

at jetty ready to row off a soon a be on board susan preparation be made for start mainsail be first hoisted size greatly surprising boy then foresail jib be got up lastly mizzen then capstan be manned anchor slowly brought on board sail being sheeted home craft began to steal through water tide be still draining up have not a yet swung wind be light a skipper have predicted be nearly due south a ketch made way out from mouth of river wide expanse of water opened before boy be filled with delight have taken seat one on side of skipper who be at tiller suppose steer by compass master chamber geoffrey said be compass have heard about always pointing to north be down below young sir will show presently steer by at night when be foggy on fine day like there be need for there be mark put up on sand steer by see way wind be now can lay course for whittaker be cruel sand be stretch out long way from point lying away on right there once past that bear away to south west for be then so to speak fairly in course of river there be many ship have be cast away on whittaker not that be worse than other sand there be score of lying in mouth of river if be for mark there must be sailing in out who put up mark lionel asked be put up by men who make business of there be one boat of sail backwards forward where river begin to narrow above sheerness ship go up down pay something according to size others cruise about with long pole putting in sand one get washed away have got different mark on single cross piece two cross piece circle diamond so that sand have got own particular mark be known to master of ship go up down river so can tell exactly where be what course to take at night anchor for there must be possibility of finding way up down in dark have heard tell from mariner who have sailed abroad that there ai place anywhere with such dangerous sand a have got here at mouth of thames in first three four hour sail geoffrey lionel acquired much nautical knowledge learned difference between mainmast mizzen found that strong rope kept mast erect stiff be called stay that rope that hoist sail be called halliard sheet be name given to rope restrain sail at lower corner be used to haul in more tightly when sailing close to wind to ease off when wind be favourable also learned that yard at head of main mizzen sail be called gaff at bottom boom think that be about enough for to remember in one day young master john lirriper said bear that in mind remember that halliard sheet have name of sail to be attached will have learnt enough to make useful can lend hand when skipper call out 'haul in jib sheet ' 'let go fore halliard now sit yourselves down again see what be doing that beacon can just see right ahead mark end of whittaker spit when get there will drop anchor till tide turn see be going across now when round that beacon will have dead against wind must be too light to take against even if be not from quarter be see there be two three other craft brought up there where have come from do think master lirriper well may have come out from burnham may have come down from london be going up to burnham to bricklesey when tide turn there be large ship anchored in channel beyond whittaker of course be going up when tide begin to flow there be mast of two vessel right over there be in channel between there be line of sand that will see will show above water when get bit lower be main channel be vessel coming from south with large draught of water generally use that while be one be handiest for ship from north small vessel from south come in by channel good bit beyond ship be narrowest of three even light draught vessel use much unless wind be favourable for there be not much room for to beat up if wind be against what be to beat up master lirriper well will see about presently think will be able to lay course beyond whittaker to lay course mean to steer way want to go if ca do that will have to beat be tedious work with light wind like dropped anchor off beacon captain said that be time to take breakfast lad already smelt agreeable odour arising from cabin forward where boy have be for time busily engaged soon whole party be seated on locker in cabin devouring fried fish master chamber geoffrey said have got two boiled pullet in basket have not better have for dinner be cooked evening before came away must think have better be eaten now have better keep for yourselves master geoffrey skipper said be accustomed to living on fish like enough must get tired of before got to london boy must not hear of be accordingly arranged that dinner must be furnished from content of basket a soon a tide turned anchor be hove up susan got under way again boy soon learnt meaning of word beating found that meant sailing backwards forward across channel with wind sometimes on one side of boat sometimes on other geoffrey wanted very much to learn why when wind be so nearly ahead boat advanced instead of drifting backwards sideways be altogether beyond power of master lirriper joe chamber to explain said one knew when sail be full vessel went in direction in head pointed be just same way with master geoffrey see when look one way be way go when turn head point way of course go off way be just same thing with ship think be same thing master lirriper geoffrey said puzzled in one case power make one go come from inside so one can go in direction one like in other come from outside must think ship must have to go way wind push if stand up give push push straight away from go sideways come forward in direction of shoulder be what ship doe john lirriper took off cap scratched head suppose be a say master geoffrey though never thought of before there be reason doubt why craft move up against wind so long a sail be full instead of drifting away to leeward though never heard tell of never heard anyone ask before daresay learned man must tell why be if ask good father when go back must wager can

with highest respect reverence earl of oxford be in eye of people of part of essex where estate lay personage of greater importance than queen herself of whose power attribute have very dim notion be not so very long since people have risen in rebellion against queen such idea a of rising against lord have never entered mind of single inhabitant of hedingham however master lirriper came to conclusion that be a geoffrey have said powerless to interfere if mr francis vere decided to take boy with what must do to prevent must hardly take forcibly down to boat against will even must do so father might not approve doubtless earl when came to hear of must be seriously angry at act of defiance of kinsman still be sure that must have very unpleasant time with mistress vickars a reassured be after better to put up with woman scolding than to bear displeasure of earl of oxford who must turn out of house ruin business drive from hedingham after be natural that lad must like to embark on

home be concerned why always seems to be cleaning day must be afraid of going into own house with boot on yes felt quite like criminal to day geoffrey laughed when came in muddy up to waist after working down there by sluice believe when spaniard open fire people will be more distracted by dust caused by falling tile chimney than by danger of life great difficulty beset duke of parma at commencement of siege sluys be built upon only piece of solid ground in district be surrounded by such labyrinth of canal ditch swamp that be said that be almost a difficult to find sluys a be to capture consequently be impossible to find ground solid enough for camp to be pitched upon first labour be erection of wooden hut for troop upon pile driven into ground hut be protected from fire of defender by bag of earth brought in boat from long distance main point selected for attack be western gate battery be also placed to play upon castle bridge of boat connecting with town there be one advantage in determining to attack at western extremity of town john menyn merchant at whose house captain vere party be lodging remarked when guest informed there be longer doubt a to point at spaniard intended to attack for will not be able to blow up wall with mine in quarter how be that francis vere asked if can spare hour of time will show merchant said can spare now von menyn vere replied for information be important whatever may be will conduct there at once there be time like present will follow sir geoffrey asked captain yes come along vere replied matter be of interest for life of can not make out what obstacle can be of host speaks at once set out john menyn led to warehouse close to western wall spoke few word to owner who at once took three lantern from wall lighted

be score similar to see sluys be centre of wine trade of flanders holland cellar like extend right under wall warehouse along here have similar cellar end of town be driest soil most easily excavated be why magazine for wine be clustered here there be not foot of ground behind under wall at end be not similarly occupied if spaniard try to drive mine to blow up wall will simply break way into cellar where can meet drive back again excellent francis vere said will relieve of work of countermining be always tiresome dangerous must be specially so here where must have to dive under deep moat outside wall now will only have to keep few men on watch in cellar must hear sound of spanish approaching will be ready to give warm reception by time break in be there communication between cellar yes for most part wine merchant said cellar be not entirely property of dealer in wine be constructed by men who let just a must let house merchant in small way must need one cellar while of occupy twenty more therefore there be for most part communication with door between various cellar so that can be let off in accordance with need of hirer well be much obliged to for telling of captain vere said williams morgan will be glad enough to hear that there be fear of being blown suddenly into air while defending wall will see importance of keeping few trusty men on watch in cellar nearest to spaniard will report matter to at once difficulty added smiling will be to keep men wakeful for seems to that very air be heavy with fume of wine chapter iv siege of sluys until spaniard have established camp planted of battery there be little firing occasionally wall piece opened upon party of officer reconnoitring few shot be fired from time to time to harass workman in enemy battery be done rather to animate townsman a signal to distant friend so far matter be going on quietly than with hope of arresting progress of enemy work many sortie be made by garrison fierce fighting took place only score two of men from company be taken upon occasion boy be compelled to remain inactive spectator of fight in sortie spanish work be frequently held for few minute gabions thrown down gun overturned after doing a much damage a must assailant have to fall back again to town being unable to resist mass of pikemen brought up against boldness of sortie bravery displayed by english ally greatly raised spirit of townsfolk who now organized into company undertook work of guarding le exposed portion of wall thus enabling garrison to keep whole strength at point attacked townsman also laboured steadily in adding to defence two company of woman be formed under female captain who took name of may in heart catherine rose did good service by building strong fort at one of threatened point work be in honour christened fort venus be scarcely compliment to venus geoffrey laughed to brother square shouldered heavily built woman at correspond with idea of goddess of love be strong enough for men lionel said must like one of big fat arm to come down upon head be not pretty look jolly good tempered if be to fight a hard a work ought to do good service there be good deal of difference between geoffrey said look at three dark haired woman with neat trim figure look a if belonged to same race a others be not of same race lad captain vere who be standing close by said big heavy woman be flemish others come doubt from walloon province bordering on france walloon broke off from rest of state joined spanish almost from first be for most part catholic have little in common with people of low country there be of course many protestant among be forced to emigrate for spanish allow protestant in country under rule alva adopted short easy plan of murdering protestant in town took war be now conducted on rather more humane principle protestant have option given of changing faith leaving country in way without intending spaniard have done good service to holland for hundred of thousand of industrious people have flocked there for shelter from antwerp ghent bruges other city have fallen into hand of spaniard thus greatly raising population of holland adding to power of defence besides presence of exile knowledge that similar fate awaits if fall again under yoke of spain nerve people to resist to utmost have not be for bigotry of spanish abominable cruelty practised by inquisition state must never have rebelled even after did so term might easily have be made with have not be maddened by wholesale massacre perpetrated by alva there do hear woman speaking language be french rather than flemish just a be speaking heavy roar of cannon broke out from eastern end of town have opened fire on castle vere exclaimed run lad quick summon company to form in market place in front of house be told off to reinforce garrison of castle in case of attack boy hurried away at top of speed have list of house in men of company be quartered a heavy roar of cannon have brought one to door to hear what be going on company be in very short time assembled francis vere placed at head marched through long street of town out through wall on to bridge of boat be first time boy have be under fire although kept good countenance acknowledged to other afterwards that have felt extremely uncomfortable a traversed bridge with ball whistling over head sometimes striking water close by sending shower of spray over troop illustration four page carry down wounded soldier felt easier when entered castle be protected by wall upon men took station with gun discharged piece against spanish artilleryman pikemen assisted bombardier to work cannon officer went to fro encouraging men page of company have little to do beyond from time to time carrying can of wine water to men engaged geoffrey lionel finding that service be not required by captain vere mounted on to wall sheltering a well a must behind battlement looked out at what be going on doe seem to geoffrey said that wall will long withstand ball of spanish battlement be already knocked down in several place can hear after shot strike wall splashing of brickwork a fall into water see there be tom carroll struck down with ball be duty to carry away ran along wall to fallen soldier two other page came up four carried to top of step then down into court yard where dutch surgeon took charge of shoulder have be struck by ball arm hung only by shred of flesh surgeon shook head can hing for said can not live many hour lionel have done share in carrying man down now turned sick faint geoffrey caught by arm steady old boy said be trying at first will soon get accustomed to here take draught of wine from flask be better now lionel said after taking draught of wine felt a if be going to faint geoffrey know why must for did not feel frightened when be on wall oh have nothing to do with fear be just sight of poor fellow blood there be nothing to be ashamed of in why saw will atkins who be one of best fighter single stick player in hedingham go off in dead swoon because man be working with crushed thumb between two heavy stone look lionel what crack there be in wall here think will stand long have better run up tell captain vere for may come toppling down with of men on captain vere on hearing news ran down examined wall yes said be evidently going good earthwork be worth dozen of wall will soon have castle about ear however be of great importance to saw lad just now on wall did not care about ordering down at time go up again except to help to carry down wounded make rule boy never to shirk duty however great risk to life may be on other hand never risk life unless be duty to do so what be gallantry in one case be foolishness in other although be page yet may well be that in such siege a will have many opportunity of showing that be of good english stock while must have shrink from danger when there be need for to expose yourselves say also that must in way run into danger wantonly several time in course of afternoon boy took turn in going up helping to bring down wounded men a time went on several yawning gap appeared in wall court yard be strewn with fragment of masonry page be ordered to keep under shelter of wall of castle unless summoned on duty indeed court yard have now become more dangerous station than wall for not only did cannon shot fly through breach fragment of brick mortar rubbish flew along with force must have be fatal to anything struck of page be big fellow of seventeen eighteen year old who have be serving for year under morgan williams must soon be transferred into rank like not sort of fighting one of said be very well when come to push of pike with spaniard to remain here like chicken in coop while batter away at be game for have fancy what say master vickars well be first experience somers can not say that be agreeable know whether must like hand to hand fighting better seems to at present that must be certainly more agreeable to be doing something than to be sitting here listening to fall of piece of masonry whistling of ball see that will be nearer when have knocked place to piece have boat if have gun on city wall must prevent using besides when bridge of boat be removed must hing if got here towards evening council be held principal officer being present be decided to evacuate castle must indeed have be held for day longer be plain must at length become untenable bridge of boat have already be struck in several place of barge composing have sunk level with water be destroyed garrison of castle must be completely cut off a great advantage be to be gained by holding position for be evident that be upon other end of town main attack be to be made be decided to evacuate under cover of night a soon a became dark decision be carried into effect for hour troop worked steadily transporting gun ammunition store of kind across from castle to town already communication with friend outside have almost ceased for first operation of enemy have be to block approach to sluys from sea boat have be moored head stern right across zwin battery erected upon shore to protect captain hart allen twice swam down to communicate with friendly vessel below obstacle carrying despatch with from governor to state general from roger williams to english commander urging that time must be lost in assembling army to march to relief of town contained assurance that garrison must defend place to last extremity pointed out that be only question of time that town must fall unless relieved dutch garrison be strong have be joined by a many english parma have at first marched with men against city have very speedily drawn much larger body of men towards have a roger williams state in letter to queen sent from sluys at early period of siege four regiment of walloon four of german one of italian one of burgundians fifty two company of spaniard twenty four troop of horse forty eight gun must give total of at least men further reinforcement afterwards arrived against so overwhelming force a must not be hoped that garrison outnumbered by more than ten to one must long maintain duke of parma looked for easy conquest of place by party possession of sluys be regarded a matter of importance out of proportion to size population of town for at time be known in england that king of spain be preparing vast fleet for invasion of britain sluys be nearest point to shore at fleet must gather force of parma embark to join coming direct from spain english therefore be determined to maintain place to last extremity while parma have considered capture a affair of few day only little garrison be determined that for week at rate must be able to prolong resistance feeling sure that before time must elapse state england knowing importance of struggle must send force to relief view taken a to uselessness of defending castle be fully justified a spaniard on following day removed gun that have employed in battering to work facing western gate fire be opened next morning under cover of spanish engineer pushed trench up to very edge of moat in spite of several desperate sortie by garrison boy have be forbidden by captain vere to take place with company on wall in time said a force decrease will want one capable of handling arm to man breach at present be not in extremity none save whom duty compels to be there must come under fire of spaniard for to do so must be risking life without gain have however made friend with wine merchant whose cellar have visited obtained permission from to visit upper storey of warehouse whenever chose from window here be enabled to watch be taking place for warehouse be much higher than wall be not in direct line of fire of spanish battery for be chiefly concentrated against wall little to right after heavy fighting spaniard one night by mean of boat from zwin landed upon dyke divided moat into two channel thus established so close under rampart that gun must not be brought to bear upon proceeded to intrench at once upon dyke governor arnold groenvelt consulted with english leader decided that enemy must be driven off dyke immediately that safety of city must be gravely imperilled therefore assembled force of four hundred men sallied out of south gate where two bastion be erected on dyke then advanced along to assault of spaniard battle be desperate one english dutch be aided by comrade on wall who shot with gun arquebus against spaniard while latter be similarly assisted by friend along outer edge of moat received constant reinforcement by boat from ship odds be too great for assailant who be forced at last to fall back along dyke to south gate to re enter town be already five week since english have arrived to take part in defence struggle now began upon great scale thirty cannon eight culverin opening fire upon wall heaviest fire be on st james day th of july when shot be fired between three in morning five in afternoon while tremendous cannonade be going on boy must not admire calmness shown by population many of shot flying over top of wall struck house in city chimney tile mass of masonry fell in street nevertheless people continued usual avocation shop be open though men employed served customer with breast back piece buckled on arm close at hand so that must run to wall at once to take part in defence did spaniard attempt assault upon woman stood knitting at door frau menyn looked a sharply after maid a ever washing scouring went on without interruption believe that woman will keep girl at work after spaniard have entered city until be thundering at door lionel said who dutch woman must give thought to few particle of dust on furniture when enemy be cannonading town think act wisely after lionel fact that everything go on a usual here in other house take people thought off danger of position prevents anything like panic being felt lad spent greater part of day at look out must see that wall against spanish fire be directed be fast crumbling looking down upon seemed deserted of troop for must be needlessly exposing soldier to death to place there while cannonade continued behind wall in street leading to company of english dutch soldier must be seen seated lying on ground be leaning out of dormer window in high roof watching spanish soldier in battery working gun when happening to look round saw crossbow protruded from window of warehouse to right moment afterwards sharp twang of bow be heard there be nothing unusual in for although firearm be now generally in use long bow cross bow have not be entirely abandoned there be still archer in english army many still held that bow be far better weapon than arquebus sending shaft well nigh a far with truer aim if fellow be noticed geoffrey said will have spanish musketeer sending ball in direction governor have heard captain vere say forbidden shooting from warehouse because doe not wish to attract spanish fire against of course when wall yield breach have to be defended warehouse will be held a window will command breach will be great aid to then must be great disadvantage to if spaniard now be to throw shell fire ball into house so to destroy before make attack can much good be gained for at distance cross bow must scarce carry bolt beyond moat most likely man be using cross bow on purpose to avoid attracting attention of spaniard geoffrey at distance must not see cross bow while puff of smoke must be sure to catch eye there have shot again did not see quarrell fall in moat see one of spanish soldier from battery be coming forward there have stooped picked something up hallo do see that have just raised arm be signal surely certainly looked like lionel agreed be sort of half wave of hand be very strange very lionel look to very suspicious be quite possible that piece of paper may have be tied round bolt that someone be sending information to enemy ought to be looked to what be to do geoffrey merely seeing spanish soldier wave arm be scarcely reason enough for bringing accusation against anyone be not even sure that picked up bolt even if did action might have be sort of mocking wave of hand at failure of shooter to send a far a battery might be of course lionel have certainly nothing to go upon must justify making report on subject quite enough to induce to keep watch on fellow whoever may be let see to begin with if shoot again waited for hour head of cross bow be not again thrust out of window may have ceased shooting for of two reason geoffrey said if be true man because see that bolt carry far enough to be of use if be traitor because have gained object know that communication have reached friend outside will go down now inquire who be occupier of next warehouse merchant be not below for a did business with other town have have nothing to do since sluys be cut off from surrounded country one of clerk be at work making out bill account in office a if thunder of gun outside be unheard by boy have often spoken to a passed in out who occupies warehouse on right geoffrey asked carelessly william arnig replied be leading citizen one of greatest merchant in trade cellar be most extensive have doe great trade in time of peace with bruges ghent antwerp other town suppose be protestant like most of town people geoffrey remarked be catholic be not one who push opinion strongly be well disposed to cause captain in one of city band catholic protestant always dwell quietly together throughout low country must have animosity against other be not for spaniard formerly at least be case since persecution have protestant town catholic town one holding to state cause other siding with spaniard why do ask have heard name of next neighbour be wondering who might be boy have now be nearly two month in holland be beginning to understand language be not difficult to acquire differed then even le than now from dialect spoken in eastern county of england between whom holland there have be for many generation much trade intimate relation what have better do next geoffrey lionel asked a left warehouse think that in first place lionel will take post at window to morrow keep close watch day to see whether shooting be repeated if be have better report matter to captain vere leave to decide what must be done see that must undertake anything alone in case see must be serious matter to lay accusation against prominent citizen who be actually captain of one of band upon following day took post again at window after hour watching saw three bolt fired from next window watching intently saw two first fall into moat must not see where other fell a there be splash in water concluded that have fallen beyond in minute saw soldier again advance from battery pick up something at edge of water raise arm retire that evening when captain vere returned from rampart informed of what have observed doubtless be act of treachery said merchant be communicating with enemy at same time what have seen although convincing evidence to be scarce enough for to denounce doubtless doe not write letter until be ready to fire off be arrested in house on way to warehouse might fail to find proof of guilt naught ill feeling must be caused among friend do must do cautiously have thought of plan by might catch in act if two three men must be introduced into warehouse concealed in room from fire might succeed in catching in act captain vere room may be empty one without place where must be hidden unless be actually in room must be of little good for must have time if heard footstep to thrust letter may have written into mouth so destroy before must be seized be so captain vere agreed matter seems difficult one yet be of greatest importance to hinder communication with spaniard to night soldier who can be spared aided by citizen able to use matlock pick be to set to work to begin to raise half moon round windmill behind point be attacking so a to have second line to fall back upon when wall give way will do ere long for be sorely shaken battered be most important to keep from knowledge of spaniard now lad have shown keenness by taking notice of what be going on see if can not go further hit upon plan of catching traitor at work if before night can think of scheme must go to governor tell frankly that have suspicion of treachery though can not prove ask in order to prevent possibility of plan being communicated to enemy to place troop in warehouse along line so that none can shoot therefrom message to spaniard just a captain vere finished supper boy came into room again have thought of plan sir that might succeed although must be somewhat difficult dormer window from bolt have be fired lie thirty forty foot away from that from be looking roof be so steep that one must hold footing upon for moment must plank be placed upon must walk window be about twelve foot from top of roof think that one standing on ledge of window might climb on to top once there swing rope with stout grapnel attached to catch on ridge of roof then two three men might climb up there work along then lower down with rope on to top of next window must need to have rope fastened round body for height be great slip must mean death one farthest out on window must lean over when hears noise below when saw cross bow thrust from window must by sudden blow knock from fellow hand when must slide down roof fall into narrow yard between warehouse wall of course men must be placed there in readiness to seize others at door of warehouse to arrest traitor if ran down think plan be good one though somewhat difficult of execution captain vere said enterprise on roof must be difficult one dangerous since a say slip must mean death lionel sir must undertake that with aid of two active men to hold rope for have done plenty of bird nesting in wood of hedingham be not likely to turn giddy think be necessary for more than one to get down on to window captain vere said only one must so place a to look down upon cross bow however will divide honour of enterprise between a eldest strongest geoffrey will carry out plan on roof while lionel will take post at door with four men to arrest traitor when leaf will select two strong active men to accompany geoffrey aid in attempt mind before try to get out of window to climb on to roof have strong rope fastened round body held by others then in case of slip can haul in again will see that rope grapnel be in readiness next morning early geoffrey proceeded with two men who have be selected to accompany to usual look out be active wiry men entered fully into spirit of undertaking when geoffrey explained nature to looked out of dormer window at sharp roof slanting away in front of up to ridge above think master vickars one of roger browne by name said that have best go up first served for year at sea be used to climbing about in dizzy place be easy matter to get from window sill astride roof above moreover be more like to heave grapnel so that will hook firmly on to ridge than be very well roger must be willing to try doubtless must manage far better than must before start will fasten other rope round body a captain vere directed to do then in case slip anything give way with weight can check before slide far down below rope be accordingly tied round man body under arm taking grapnel to other rope be attached got out on to sill be not easy task to climb up on to ridge of dormer window needed strength activity to accomplish feat once astride of ridge rest be easy at first cast threw grapnel so that caught securely on top of roof after testing with two three pull clambered up leaving lower end of rope hanging by side of window a soon a have gained position geoffrey who be to follow prepared to start according to instruction browne have given fastened end of rope be round browne body under own shoulder then leaning over taking firm hold of rope to grapnel be attached let out of window browne hauled from above at rope round body pulled with hand by attached to grapnel presently reached top be glad came first roger said think must have ever pulled up if have not assisted unfastened rope end be thrown down to window job tredgold other man fastened round be hauled up a geoffrey have be will move along now to stack of chimney coming through roof four foot below ridge on town side geoffrey said can stand down there out of sight of spaniard will be sure to attract attention sitting up here might have bullet flying round ear besides fellow friend might suspect object signal to in way be two hour yet to time when have twice seen send bolt across moat be accordingly done for hour half sat down on roof with foot against stack of chimney be time to be moving now geoffrey said at last think best way will be for to get by side of dormer window instead of above must be very awkward leaning over there must not have strength to strike blow whereas with rope under arm foot on edge of sill project few inch beyond side of window must stand upright strike downright blow on cross bow must be best way think roger browne agreed will come down on to top of window lean over in first place foot might slip a dangle there by rope might cut let shoot over might lean out shoot a climb up roof again if be above with pistol in readiness there will be fear of accident chapter v heroic defence plan roger browne suggested be carried out geoffrey be first lowered to place by side of window bracing against side with foot on sill managed to stand upright leaning against rope that job tredgold held from above job have instruction when geoffrey lifted arm to ease rope few inch so a to enable lad to lean forward after two three attempt geoffrey got rope to exact length must enable to look round corner to strike blow with right hand in held stout club roger browne then descended by aid of other rope fastening round body lay down astride of roof of window with head shoulder over end pistol held in readiness seemed age to geoffrey before heard sound of footstep in loft beside grasped cudgel firmly leaned slightly forward for ten minute there be quiet within geoffrey guessed that traitor be writing missive be about to send to enemy then footstep approached window moment later cross bow be thrust out glance at sufficed to show that bolt be enveloped in piece of paper wound round secured with string steadying a well a must geoffrey struck with force down upon cross bow weapon loosely held went clattering down tile there be exclamation of surprise fury from within window at same moment job tredgold seeing that geoffrey attempt have be successful hauled away at rope began to drag backward up tile lad saw man lean out of window look up at then pistol be levelled report came from above window not from threatening weapon sharp cry of pain be heard a pistol fell from man hand followed cross bow down roof few second later geoffrey be hauled up to ridge where be at once joined by roger browne shifting rope moved along till above window from have issued geoffrey be first lowered down a soon a have got in at window undid rope job tredgold followed while roger browne slid down by rope attached to grapnel then ran downstairs a soon a sallied out below saw that lionel men with have captured prisoner just a joined party guard came round from other side of warehouse bringing with cross bow bolt pistol prisoner whose shoulder be broken by roger browne shot be at once taken to captain vere be quarter officer have just arrived from wall knowing time at capture must probably be made so have succeeded said well done lad have earned thanks of will take man at once to governor who be at present at town hall by time issued out quite crowd have assembled for news that william von arnig have be brought prisoner wounded to captain vere be quarter have spread rapidly crowd increased a went along captain vere party have difficulty in making way to town hall many of people exclaiming loudly against treatment of one of leading citizen governor be when entered holding council with english leader sir roger williams why what be captain vere asked in surprise a officer accompanied by two boy followed by roger browne job tredgold guarding prisoner entered have to accuse man of treacherously communicating with enemy francis vere said what arnold de groenvelt exclaimed in surprise why be mynheer von arnig one of most worshipful citizen surely captain vere there must be error here will place evidence before captain vere said will be for to decide upon master geoffrey vickars please to inform governor what know about matter geoffrey then stated how brother being at upper window of warehouse have on two day in succession seen cross bow discharged from neighbouring window have noticed spanish soldier come out of battery pick up something believed to be bolt how brother have reported circumstance to captain vere that officer then took up story stated that seeing evidence be not conclusive be probable that if attempt be made to arrest person whomsoever might be who have used cross bow evidence of treasonable design might be destroyed before be seized have accepted offer of master vickars to climb roof lower to window from bolt must be shot if possible strike from man hand so that must fall down roof to court yard below where men be placed to seize geoffrey then related how with two soldier guarding prisoner have scaled roof taken position by window how have seen cross bow thrust out have struck from hand of man holding how latter have leaned out must have shot have not roger browne from post above window shot in shoulder here be cross bow pistol captain vere said be bolt a be picked up by men see sir there be paper fastened round know not content for judged best to leave a be found until placed in hand governor cut string unrolled paper examined contained statement a to state of wall with remark where be yielding where enemy have best shoot against said that defender have in night begun to form half moon behind contained sketch showing exact position of new work gentleman what think of governor asked english officer there can be doubt that be foul act of treachery williams said traitor merit death will not decide upon ourselves governor said will summon six of leading citizen who will sit a jury with be grave matter touch honour of citizen a well a safety of town in few minute six citizen summoned arrived evidence be again given then prisoner be asked what have to say in defence be useless for to deny replied be caught in act must suffer for have done duty to king of spain sovereign warn will take vengeance for blood that must risk governor said now gentleman citizen of town now attacked by spaniard sir who be in command of soldier of queen of england have heard evidence answer prisoner have made what be opinion thereon do sir roger williams being highest in rank authority first give opinion find that be guilty of act of gross treason treachery for such there be one punishment death six citizen gave same decision be found guilty of foul crime governor said be sentenced to death in hour will be hung in market place a punishment to warning to other traitor if such there be in town of sluys a to young sir have rendered great service to town have shown discernment beyond year thank in name of city of garrison also in of state whose servant be guard of armed citizen be now called in prisoner be handed to order given to officer to carry sentence into effect statement of crime of prisoner with name of who have acted a judge sentence be then drawn out signed by governor ordered by to be affixed to door of town two lad finding that be no longer required hastened back to quarter having wish to be present at execution of unhappy wretch whose crime have be mean of detecting few day later considerable portion of battered wall fell shortly afterwards breach of two hundred fifty pace long be effected bridge of large boat constructed by enemy from dyke to foot of rampart be not effected without terrible loss hundred of bravest spanish soldier sailor be killed three officer who succeeded other in command of attack be badly wounded spanish have laboured under great difficulty owing to lack of earth to push trench forward to edge of moat arising from surrounding country being flooded only succeeded at last by building wooden machine of bullet proof plank on wheel behind of four men must work when be prepared spaniard advanced to attack rushing up breach with splendid valour headed by three of bravest leader be met by english dutch again again hurled back day night fighting continued spaniard occasionally retiring to allow artillery to open fire again upon shattered ruin stoutly a defender fought step by step spaniard won way forward until have captured breach west gate adjoining there being nothing now beyond hastily constructed inner work between town finest regiment of whole of spanish infantry now advanced to assault be met by defender already sadly diminished in number firm undaunted a ever pike ax well supplied place of fallen wall assault after assault be met repulsed sir roger williams thomas baskerville francis vere being always in thick of fight baskerville be distinguished by white plume of helmet vere by crimson mantle valour of leader attracted admiration of duke of parma who watched fight from summit of tower of western gate francis vere be twice wounded not disabled sir roger williams urged to retire replied that must rather be killed ten time in breach than once in house day by day terrible struggle continued spaniard be able constantly to bring up fresh troop defender have relief be reduced in number from to men yet for eighteen day maintained struggle never once leaving breach page brought food to when attack be fiercest joined in defence fighting a boldly manfully a soldier geoffrey lionel kept in close attendance upon francis vere only leaving to run back to quarter bring up meal cooked for two officer by frau menyn handmaid kept close to during fighting knew that be match in strength for spanish pikemen have obtained pistol from armoury with did good service several time freeing from of assailant when be sorely pressed on one occasion when francis vere be smitten down by blow from axe boy rushed forward kept back assailant until of men of company came to aid have done brave service indeed captain vere said to when recovered for helmet have defended from serious injury though force of blow have felled be happy thought of mine when decided to bring with be not first time that have rendered good service be sure will turn out brave valiant soldier of queen when assault ceased weary soldier threw down behind earthen embankment obtained such sleep a must before spaniard mustered for fresh attack when after eighteen day terrible fighting duke of parma saw even best troop be unable to break through wall of steel desisted from assault began slower process of mining garrison from look out beheld soldier crossing bridge with pick shovel prepared to meet in new style of warfare captain uvedale be appointed to command men told off for duty gallery be run from several of cellar to meet of enemy a man be employed either on rampart in mining many of page be told off to act a watcher in cellar to listen for faint sound that told of approach of enemy miner a young vickars be in attendance on officer be exempted from work frequently went down into cellar to watch process of mining by own men to listen to faint sound made by enemy workman one day be sitting on two wine keg watching four soldier at work at end of short gallery have be driven towards spaniard suddenly there be explosion miner be blown backwards end of gallery disappeared crowd of walloon soldier almost immediately afterwards rushed in boy sprang to foot be about to fly when idea occurred to geoffrey seized torch standing by side of barrel placed on end by large tier shouted in dutch step forward fire magazine men in front paused through fume of smoke saw dimly pile of barrel figure standing with lighted torch close to one of panic seized believing have made way into powder magazine that in instant there must be terrible explosion turned with shout of magazine magazine fly be dead men run lionel get help geoffrey said in two three minute number of soldier ran down into cellar walloon be not long before recovered from panic officer knew that wine cellar of city be in front of reassured a to character of barrel have seen be however too late furious conflict took place at entrance into cellar enemy able only to

while be hampered thwarted by intrigue duplicity of elizabeth who be constantly engaged in half hearted negotiation now with france now with spain whose capricious temper be continually overthrowing best laid plan of councillor paralysing action of commander be not until saw kingdom threatened by invasion that placed fairly at head of national movement inspired subject with energy determination geoffrey vickars have be somewhat severely wounded upon last day of struggle in cellar spanish officer having beaten down guard cleft through morion lionel be unwounded fatigue excitement have told

vere a among bravest best of captain although a page can have have nought to do with fighting will have credit a serving under banner think father geoffrey said touching plaster on head look somewhat a if have have something to do with fighting here be letter for from captain vere will give information about mr vickars adjusted horn spectacle on face opened letter began dear master friend have have mean of writing to since letter came to having have other matter in hand being cut off from communication with england be glad to find that did not take amiss carrying off of son indeed action have turned out more happily than might have be expected for own that be young for such rough service however have proved valiant young gentleman fought stoutly by side during long tussle with spaniard more than once saved life by ridding of foe who must have taken at disadvantage once indeed when be down from blow on pate from spanish axe rushed forward kept assailant at bay until rescue came discovered plot between traitor in town spaniard succeeded in defeating plan bringing to justice be also mean of preventing spaniard from breaking into great wine cellar capturing warehouse for of service received thanks of dutch governor of sir roger williams leader thus see although so young have distinguished mightily must aught befall there be many among friend who will gladly take under protection push forward have sent home for time to have quiet rest need after exertion have done more willingly since there be chance of fighting for many month to come hope that before spaniard again advance against may have by side well well be wonderful mr vickars said when husband have finished reading letter if have told must not have believed although have never be given to sin of lying since be writ in master vere own hand can not be doubted now tell about boy will tell when have have dinner mother brisk essex air have given appetite until be satisfied must excuse telling long story be earl at castle father because have two letter to from captain francis one believe touching affair other on private matter have also letter from to mother brother john have better send off at once by

with earl begin talking lose account of time only last week kept dinner waiting for two hour be half past eleven now will hurry on so that will be ready few minute before noon very well dear will go out into village at once find messenger to despatch to cropping hall with letter to dame elizabeth john vere boy story be not told until after supper for a soon a dinner be over mr vickars went up to castle with letter for earl latter after reading told that cousin spoke most highly of two son said have be of great service even a far a saving of life earl told mr vickars to bring boy up next day to see in order that might learn full account of fighting at sluys that hoped must very often come in must while be at home practise daily with master of arm at castle know mr vickars that have hoped that one of must enter church see that taste lie not in direction be evident that a in case of cousin francis be cut out for soldier be afraid so mr vickars said must let have own way for hold that none must be forced to follow ministry save whose natural bent lie that way think have chosen badly earl said cousin francis bid fair to make great soldier a start in life a page will have chance of getting on warrant that francis will push fortune perhaps may be able to aid somewhat if aught come of vapouring of spaniard before boy return to holland will ride with be already arming tenantry having practised in warlike exercise in spring will fit out two ship at harwich to join fleet will put to sea must spaniard carry out threat of invading chapter vi loss of susan there be few people in hedingham more pleased to see two lad on return than john lirriper to whom paid visit on first day went out be glad to see back young master though to say truth be not looking nigh so strong well a did when last parted from will soon be all right again john have have rather rough time of over there in sluys ah so have heard tell master geoffrey father read out from pulpit letter earl have received from captain francis telling about fighting mentioned that be alive well have done good service be only short letter sent off in haste day after others have got out of town be right glad when heard can tell for there have be nought talked of here siege though lady mother have not said much to always held ready to slip round corner into house when saw come down street for knew well enough what be in mind be just saying to herself 'john lirriper if have be for two boy must not be in peril now if aught come to will be doing ' though be not fault a far a must see for captain francis took off hand a be have more to say in matter than child still there be right glad be when heard that siege be over be alive have bad time of can tell when first got back young sir for mother rated finely though father said be not fault in way must not listen to said have given into charge have right to hand over to others save with father permission not if be to earl for long time after must make a if did see if met in street when wife be ill about time sent down broth simple to sent by one of maid never came save when knew be away in boat however day after reading of letter came in said be sorry have treated hardly that have known at heart along that be not altogether fault asked pardon a nice a if have be earl of course said there be nothing to ask pardon for indeed that thought be only natural must have blamed for have often blamed though not seeing how must have done otherwise however be right glad when matter be made up for be not pleasant for man when parson wife set against be certainly hard upon john geoffrey said be sure mother doe not in way blame now see brought home letter from captain vere rather sir francis for have be knighted now be good enough to speak very kindly of what be able to do in siege mother did not say much be sure that at heart be very grateful for earl came down to rectory spoke warmly about said that must always be fast friend because have given cousin help when be roughly pressed by spaniard hope will have sail with in short time for be not going back to netherlands at present a thing be likely to be quiet there now although did not say so think sir francis thought that be over young for such rough work must be more useful in year time for see in siege even page have to take share in fighting when come to push of pike with spaniard more strength vigour be needed than posse at present so be to continue practice at arm at castle to take part in drilling of company earl be raising in case spaniard carry out threat of invading england mr vickars offered objection whatever first time geoffrey asked permission to go down to bricklesey with john lirriper have objection geoffrey indeed now that have chosen own life be page to sir francis vere seems to that in matter of kind can judge for now that have taken to soldiering have borne part in great siege have even yourselves fought with spaniard deem that have got beyond wing must now act in small matter a plea that since have already run great danger of life may do so again ere long must be folly of to try to keep at apron string to treat a if be still child so two lad often accompanied john lirriper to bricklesey twice sailed up river to london back in joe chamber smack jaunt furnishing pleasant change to work of practising with pike sword with men at arm at castle learning word of command work of officer in drilling newly raised corp one day john lirriper told that nephew be time going to sail up medway to rochester must be glad to take with if liked for be by time prime favourite with master of susan although mother have told that be at liberty to go a pleased nevertheless always made point of asking permission before went away if wind be fair will not be long away on trip mother two day will take up to rochester will be day loading there will therefore be back on saturday if wind serf may even be sooner if weather be fine sail with night tide a likely enough will for moon be nearly full there will be plenty of light to keep course free of sand permission be readily given mr vickars have come to see that be useless to worry over small matter therefore nodded cheerfully said must give order at once for couple of chicken to be killed other provision prepared for voyage doubt be going to have rougher voyage than usual time young master john lirriper said when boat be approaching bricklesey sky look wild think there be going to be break in weather however susan be stout boat nephew careful navigator must like rough voyage for change john geoffrey said have always have still water light wind on trip must like good blow well think will have one though may be will only come on thick wet still think there be wind in cloud that if doe come will be from south east in case will have sharp buffeting will make good passage enough down to nore once be fairly round whittaker glad to see young master joe chamber said a boat came alongside

deck day have just broken sky be overspread by dark cloud there be not much wind after geoffrey said a looked round have fallen light during last two hour skipper replied expect will have plenty before long however must do with little more now tide be half out when started joe chamber have said night before that intended to drop down to edge of sand there anchor to make across past whittaker beacon into channel a soon a there be sufficient water to enable to do so wind be light sometimes scarcely sufficient to belly out sail give boat steerage way at others coming in short puff heeled over made spring forward merrily before long wind fell lighter lighter at last joe chamber ordered oar to be got out must get down to edge of buxey said before tide turn will have against with wind must never be able to stem must be swept up crouch at present be helping with couple of hour rowing may save to buxey boy helped at sweep for two hour creaking of oar dull flapping of sail alone broke silence of calm lad be by mean sorry when skipper gave order for anchor to be dropped must like to have got about mile further said can see by landmark that be making way now tide be beginning to suck in how long will be before have water enough to cross spit lionel asked a laid in oar well nigh four hour master lionel then even if keep stark calm like will be able to get across sand mile two up channel before meet tide there must anchor again till first strength be past then if wind spring up can work along at edge of sand against there be tide close in to sand after first two hour still think be going to turn into wind presently if doe will be sharp heavy warrant be that rain sky grew darker darker until water looked almost black under leaden canopy wish be back into bricklesey joe chamber said have be well nigh fifteen year going backwards forward here know that ever saw awkwarder look about sky reminds of what have heard men who have sailed to indie say have seen there before hurricane break if be not that saw cloud flying fast overhead when started must have said be thick sea fog have rolled in upon ah there be first drop care how hard come down so that there be not wind at tail of squall of wind before rain be soon over when follows rain will soon have sail close reefed have best go below will be wet through in minute great drop be pattering down on deck causing splash a of ink on surface of oily looking water half minute be pouring with mighty roar on deck that boy below needed to shout to make other heard lasted five minute then stopped a suddenly a began lad at once returned to deck so be over master chamber well first part be over be only sort of beginning look at light under cloud away to south of east be where be coming from unless be mistaken turn to get mainsail down lad for although after dropping anchor head sail have be lowered main mizzen be still on men set to work boy helped to stow sail fasten with tier suddenly there be sharp puff of wind lasted few second only then joe chamber pointed towards spot whence hazy light seemed to come here come said do see line of white water be squall mistake be glad be not under sail there be sharp hissing sound a line of white water approached then squall struck with such force fury that lad instinctively grasped at shroud mizzen have brought craft in moment head to wind joe chamber two sailor at once lowered stowed away only put couple of tier on skipper shouted may have to upsail again if go on sea got up with great rapidity few minute after squall have struck susan be beginning to pitch heavily wind increased in force seemed to scream rather than whistle in rigging sea be getting up fast geoffrey shouted in skipper ear a took place close to wo be very heavy yet joe chamber replied sand break force tide have turned now a make over sand there will be tremendous sea here in time be if wind hold seems to that be going to be unusual gale altogether how long will be before can cross spit be not going to cross to day be certain skipper said there will be sea over sand must knock life out of strongest craft that ever floated will wait here for hour two if can then slip cable run for crouch be narrow channel never care about going into after dark until there be water enough for craft of draught over sand ai night now be well nigh a dark there be making out bearing of land have got to trust to perch fisherman put up at bend of channel however have got to try anchor must never hold here when sea get over sand if did must pull head under water in hour sea have got up seemed to boy tremendous dark a be must see in various direction tract of white water where wave broke wildly over sand second anchor have be let go time before two cable be a taut a iron bar boat be pulling bow under sea joe chamber dropped lead line overboard watched closely be dragging anchor said there be nothing for to run went to bow fastened two log of wood by long line to cable outside bow so that must find recover anchor on return then very small jib be hoisted a filled two blow with axe severed cable inboard log attached to be thrown over skipper ran aft put up helm a boat head payed off before wind a did so wave struck threw ton of water on board filling deck nearly up to rail be well joe have shouted to boy to hold on for have not done so must have be swept overboard wave struck before be fairly round smashing in bulwark sweeping everything before boy thought that susan be sinking under foot however recovered water poured out through broken bulwark boat rose again on wave a swept one after down upon stern channel be well marked now for sand on side be covered with breaking water joe chamber shouted to sailor to close reef mizzen hoist so that might have boat better under control wind be not directly astern somewhat on quarter small a be amount of sail shown boat lay over till lee rail be at time under water following wave yawing about so much that needed most careful steering to prevent from broaching to seems to a wind be northering one of men shouted skipper nodded slackened out sheet bit a wind came more astern kept eye fixed ahead of men kept gazing through gloom there be perch one of shouted presently just on weather bow skipper nodded held on same course until abreast of perch be only forked stick men came aft hauled in mizzen sheet chamber put up helm mizzen came across with jerk sheet be again allowed to run out jib came over with report like shot of cannon at same moment split into streamer hoist foresail skipper shouted men sprang forward seized halliard at moment wind seemed to blow with double fury moment sail be set too split into ribbon get up jib joe chamber shouted one of men sprang below in minute reappeared with sail up with quick bill be drifting bodily down on sand bill hurried forward other hand have hauled in traveller to bolt rope of jib be still attached hauling on have got block down in readiness for fastening on new jib sheet be hooked on then while one hand ran sail out with out haul to bowsprit end other hoisted with halliard by time boat be close to broken water a sail filled head payed off towards wind lay right over before must gather way there be tremendous crash susan have struck on sand next wave lifted a passed on came down with crash seemed to shake in piece joe chamber relaxed grasp of now useless tiller be over said to boy nothing can save now if have be own length farther off sand must have gathered way in time a be ten minute will be in splinter be now lying over until masthead be few foot above water sea be striking with tremendous force pouring deluge of water over there be one chance for went on wind be dead on shore foulness lie scarce three mile to leeward illustration next few minute be wild struggle for life went into cabin fetched out small axe fastened in companion where be within reach of helmsman two blow cut shroud of mizzen few vigorous stroke be given to foot of mast a boat lifted crashed down again on sand broke off few inch above deck now lad will lash loosely to can both swim with what aid will give may well reach shore there be scarce three foot of water here except where one two deep pas across there be more anywhere between land will not be rough very far now be off at once boat will go to piece before many minute two men will take to mainmast want to see off first without hesitation boy pushed off with mast a did so cataract of water poured over smack upon knocking for moment under surface with force for next few minute be wild struggle for life found at once that be powerless to swim in broken water a rushed across sand impelled alike by rising tide behind force of wind hurried along at rapid pace breaking in short steep wave must only cling to mast snatch breath of air from time to time a rolled over over have not be able to swim must very speedily have be drowned accustomed a be to diving kept presence of mind holding breath when under water breathing whenever be above with face to land be only so that must breathe for air be thick with spray be swept along with such force by wind that must have drowned best swimmer who tried to face a speedily a if have be under water after what seemed to age wave became somewhat le violent though still breaking in mass of foam geoffrey loosed hold of spar tried to get to foot be knocked down several time before succeeded when did so found that water be little more than two foot deep although wave rose to shoulder soft mud under foot rendered extremely difficult to stand rope attached to spar be driving before added to difficulty must not overtake mast threw down again swam to get up lionel shouted can stand here lionel be too exhausted to be capable of making effort with greatest difficulty geoffrey raised to foot supported with back to wind get breath again shouted be over worse now will soon be in calmer water get foot well out in front of if can dig heel into mud then will act a buttress to help to keep foot be two three minute before lionel be able to speak even during short time have be carried distance forward for ground on stood seemed to be moving force of wave carried constantly forward feel better old fellow geoffrey asked a felt lionel making effort to resist pressure of water yes be better now lionel said well will go on a be a long a can let just try to keep foot give way to sea a take along quicker go sooner will be in willower water tide be rising fast unless go on will speedily be a bad here a be where started a soon a lionel have sufficiently recovered again took to spar now instead of clasping with arm leg lay with chest upon used effort only to keep going before wind tide once came to point where sand be few inch under water here stood up for minute then again proceeded on foot until water deepened to waist progress be now much more easy for high bank have broken run of surf water beyond be much smoother be able to swim pushing spar before be in deep water geoffrey said presently dropping foot be out of depth chamber said there be deep channel across sand not far from island so in case shore can not be far away in quarter of hour water be again waist deep geoffrey stood up think see dark line ahead lionel will soon be there ten minute water be not above knee must see low shore now at distance of few hundred yard ahead untying rope under arm let spar drift on waded forward until reached land there be long mud bank yet to cross exhausted a be took long time to do at last came to sandy bank rising sharply ten foot above flat threw down on lay for hour without word being spoken now lionel geoffrey said at last raising to sitting position must make effort to get on find shelter there be people living in island have heard that be wild set making living by wreck on sand by smuggling good without paying due to queen still will not refuse shelter food assuredly there be nothing on to tempt to plunder rose to foot helped lionel up once on top of bank level country stretched before wind aided footstep sweeping along with such tremendous force at time have difficulty in keeping foot a went on came upon patch of cultivated land with hedgerow deep ditch mile further perceived house on approaching saw that be low structure of size with several out building made way to knocked at door knocked twice before be opened then bolt be withdrawn door be opened few inch man looked out seeing two lad opened widely well who be what do want asked roughly have be wrecked in storm on sand be sailing from bricklesey for sheerness when storm caught man looked at closely pale face evidently exhausted condition vouched for truth of story house be full said gruffly can not take in stranger will find dry hay in out house will bring food there when have eaten drunk have best journey on so saying shut door in face be strange treatment geoffrey said must not have thought man must have refused shelter to dog such day a what do say lionel will go on think can go further until have rested geoffrey lionel replied faintly let lie down in shelter if be only for hour after if man brings food a say can go on again went into shed man have pointed out be half full of hay let take thing off wring lionel give roll in hay to dry will soon get warm after that stripped wrung water from clothes rolled in hay until felt glow of returning warmth then put on clothes again scarcely have done so when man came in with large tankard two hunk of bread here said drink then be off want stranger hanging round here at other time boy must have refused hospitality so cheerlessly offered be too weak to resist temptation tankard contained hot spiced ale sensation of warmth comfort stole over a soon a have drunk content eaten few mouthful of bread man stood by while ate be only one saved from wreck asked trust that be not geoffrey replied master of boat tied to mast a soon a struck two men with be going to try to get to shore in same way a soon a have finished stood up handed tankard to man be sorry must turn out said a if somewhat ashamed of want of courtesy other day must be different to day can not take anyone in thank for what have given geoffrey said can tell be way to ferry follow road will take there about couple of mile can not mistake way feeling greatly strengthened refreshed lad again started be curious affair geoffrey said can not make out why must not let in however doe not matter much feel warm over now in spite of wet clothes so do lionel agreed perhaps there be smuggler inside fugitive from justice hiding there anyhow be thankful for warm ale seems to have given new life altogether have walked quarter of mile when saw four horseman coming on road be closely wrapped up in cloak a passed with head bent down to meet force of gale broad brimmed hat pulled low down over eye boy did not get even glimpse of feature wonder who can be geoffrey said looking after be very well mounted look like person of degree what on earth can be doing in wretched place a must be going to house left for noticed road stopped there be curious geoffrey be business of ours know that lionel know there be sort of rumour about of papist plot conspirator must hardly choose more out of way spot than to hold meeting must not be at surprised if there be mischief on foot mile further three men on foot met like others be closely wrapped up to eye have ridden here geoffrey said after have passed have high riding boot on must have left horse on other side of ferry see there be village short distance ahead will go in there dry clothes have substantial meal if can get then will talk business over village consisted of dozen house only among be small public house several men be sitting by fire with pot of ale before have be wrecked on coast landlord have barely escaped with life want to dry clothes to have what food can give have plenty of egg landlord said wife will fry for have meat in house fish egg

blanket to wrap yourselves in can sit by fire here until thing be dry hearty meal of fried egg drink of hot ale completed restoration of boy clothes be speedily dried for landlady have just finished baking week batch of bread hour in oven completely dried clothes be ready almost a soon a meal be finished many question be asked a to wreck point at have be cast ashore be short distance from house at end of road geoffrey said went there for shelter must not take in though gave bread hot ale exclamation of indignation be heard among men sitting round ralph hawker have name of being surly man one said must not have thought that must have turned shipwrecked man from door on day a say be papist though whether be not can not say have strange way there be many stranger pass ferry asks for house however be affair of mine though hold there be good in secret way be so said go beyond reason for man to refuse shelter to sea have cast ashore such day a a soon a have finished meal again dressed lad paid reckoning went out scarcely have done so when two horseman rode up drawing rein inquired if be going right for house of one ralph hawker lie about mile on geoffrey said can not miss way road end there a spoke gust of wind of extra fury blew off one of rider hat be stopped by wall of house few yard away geoffrey caught handed to horseman with word of thanks pressed firmly on head two men rode on did notice that geoffrey asked brother have shaven spot on top of head man be papist priest in disguise there be something afoot lionel vote that try get to bottom of be ready if think so geoffrey be hazardous business know for be unarmed there be know seven eight of at rate must risk that geoffrey said besides can run if can not fight let have try come of chapter vii popish plot there be one about for wind be blowing with such fury that few cared to venture out of door boy therefore started back along road by have come without being observed have better strike off from road geoffrey said for more of men may be coming along like enough someone will be on watch at house so have best make long detour when get near come down on from other side know saw window there be well enough lionel agreed question be how be to hear what be saying inside be obliged to shout to catch others word now there be not least chance of hearing anything through closed shutter must wait till get there then see what be to be done lionel managed to detect plot at sluys may have same luck here after hour brisk walking again approached house from side at have before come upon where a geoffrey observed there be window made way cautiously up to then moved quietly round to side here there be two window on ground floor shutter be closed for glass be unknown except in house of comparatively wealthy place be taken by oiled paper in bad weather be protected by outer shutter geoffrey stole out few pace to look at window above be evidently loft said a rejoined lionel can see by roof that room live in be entirely upon ground floor if can get in there might possibly hear what be going on below room be not likely to be ceiled there be sure to be crack between plank through can see what be going on below noise of wind be so great there be little chance of hearing now let look about for something to help to climb up lying by out house close by found rough ladder composed of single pole with bit of wood nailed on to foot apart placed up against door of loft must see that be fastened only by hasp with piece of wood put through staple have be arranged that geoffrey only must go up lionel removing pole when entered keeping watch behind out house lest anyone must come round house have cut heavy stick a came along to give mean of defence lionel stood at pole while geoffrey climbed up removed piece of wood from staple then holding hasp to prevent wind blowing in door with crash entered loft glance showed that extended over whole of house that be entirely empty closed door behind jammed with couple of wedge of wood have cut before mounting then lay down on rough plank began to crawl along saw gleam of light at further end felt sure that proceeded from room in party be assembled although have little fear of being heard owing to din kept up by wind moved along with extreme care until reached spot whence light proceeded a have anticipated be caused by light in room below streaming through crack between rough planking rising on to knee looked round then crawled to crack appeared much wider than rest board being more than inch apart lying down over be able to obtain view of portion of room below must see part of long table looked down upon head of five men sitting on one side of now applied ear to crevice man be speaking in interval between gust of wind shook house to foundation must hear what be said be use hesitating longer time for action have arrived jezebel must be removed interest of holy religion little danger in carrying out plan have be proposed next time windsor road pass through wood near datchet weak guard overpowered two told off to execute free england from tyranny glory honour throughout catholic world england disorganized without head must offer resistance a soon a day fixed meet at staines at house of final detail share man be to done scatter through country readiness for rising philip of spain be last sentence geoffrey caught for when speaker ceased confused general talk took place must only catch word here there without meaning connection therefore drew quietly back to door of loft opened thought first of jumping straight down in

long be foreseen a inevitable one power be champion of roman catholicism other of protestantism yet although so much hung upon result of encounter europe looked on with most intense interest party entered upon struggle without ally entirely from personal fault of sovereign of two nation queen elizabeth by constant intrigue underhand dealing with france spain grasping policy in netherlands meanness parsimony fact that be ready at moment to sacrifice netherlands to own policy have wholly alienated people of low country for while own effort for defence be paralysed by constant interference of elizabeth benefit be obtained from english army whose order be to stand always on defensive queen only anxiety appearing to be to keep grasp upon town have be handed over to a price of alliance own counsellor be driven to wit end by constant change of purpose troop be starving in rag from parsimony fleet lay dismantled useless from want of fund except such arming drilling a took place at expense of noble county city preparation be made to meet coming storm upon other hand philip of spain who might have be at head of great catholic league against england have isolated by personal ambition have declared ready in event of conquest of england to place james of scotland upon throne must have have scotland with together with catholic of england still powerful important body france too must have joined combination against elizabeth protestant of england must have be well nigh irresistible must not bring to do dream be annexation of england to spain smarting a english catholic be under execution of mary of english spirit revolted against idea of rule of spain great catholic noble hastened when moment of danger arrived to join in defence of country while scotland seeing advantage to be gained in struggle stood sullenly aloof france gave aid to project be to result if successful in aggrandizement of already dangerously formidable neighbour thus england spain stood alone philip slowly steadily preparing for great expedition for conquest of england elizabeth hesitating doubtful at one moment gathering seaman arming fleet month two later discharging sailor laying up ship in spring of drake with six vessel belonging to crown twenty four equipped by merchant of london other place have seized moment when elizabeth fickle mind have inclined to warlike measure knowing that mood might last day have slipped out of plymouth sailed for spain few hour before messenger arrived with peremptory order from elizabeth against entering spanish port offering

english seaman a be prisoner in spain reply be there be english prisoner in spain a be notoriously untrue be agreed in fleet that spaniard might take in future must be sold to moor money reserved for redeeming of such englishman a might be in captivity there elsewhere english fleet then sailed for cape st vincent picking up on way large convoy of store ship bound for tagus where armada be collecting be burned drake brought up at cape st vincent hoping to meet there portion of armada expected from mediterranean a harbour be necessary landed stormed fort at faro took possession of harbour there expected enemy did not appear drake sailed up to mouth of tagus intending to go into lisbon attack great spanish fleet lying there under admiral santa cruz that force gathered there be enormous drake well knew relying a much on goodness of cause a on valour of sailor upon fact that enemy must be too crowded together to fight with advantage must have carried out plan have not ship arrived from england with order forbidding to enter tagus however lay for time at mouth of river destroying ship entered mouth sending in challenge to santa cruz to come out fight spanish admiral did not accept drake then sailed to corunna there a at cadiz destroyed ship collected in harbour then returned to england having in course of few month inflicted enormous amount of damage upon spain having taken first step to prove england be mistress of sea while little band of english have be defending sluys against army of duke of parma philip have be continuing preparation filling up void made by destruction wrought by drake preparing armada might well have considered to be invincible elizabeth be still continuing negotiation be quite ready to abandon netherlands to spain if must keep town held there must not bring to hand over to netherlands to spain urged state to make peace to replied that did not wish for peace on such term a spain must alone grant must defend for ten year longer if left alone did not ask for further help only wanted town restored to have armada started a philip intended in september must have found england entirely unprepared for elizabeth still obstinately refused to believe in danger few ship have be held in commission after drake return have be so long neglected that must hardly keep sea without repair rest lay unrigged in medway delay gave fresh time for preparation parma army be lying in readiness for invasion under canvas at dunkirk commander have received information from spain that sailing of armada be delayed cold wet exposure told terribly upon of who be ready to embark in september not be fit for service at commencement of year expense of army of armada be so great that philip be at last driven to give order to armada to

got ready for sea sent sailor to home execution of philip order be prevented by sudden death of santa cruz duke of medina sidonia be appointed successor a knew nothing of state of armada fresh delay became necessary time be occupied by elizabeth not in preparing for defence of country in fresh negotiation for peace be ready to make concession to spain philip be now only amusing by deceiving everything be now prepared for expedition just a fleet be ready to start negotiation be broken off though elizabeth government have made preparation for defence of country england have not be idle throughout whole country men have be mustered officered armed be ready to move a soon a danger became imminent muster of midland county strong be to form separate army be to march at once to spot between windsor harrow rest be to gather at point of danger coast company be to fall back wherever enemy landed burning corn driving off cattle avoiding battle until force of neighbouring county joined must landing take place a be expected in suffolk kent sussex be calculated that between men must bar way to invader before reached while men of western county must remain to encounter duke of guise who have engaged to bring across army of frenchman to aid spaniard spain although well aware of strength of england on sea believed that must have difficulty with raw english levy parma who have met english at sluys have learnt to respect fighting quality in letter to philip gave opinion that even if armada brought reinforcement of men must still have insufficient force for conquest of england said when will have landed must fight battle after battle will lose men by wound disease must leave detachment behind to keep open communication in short time body of army will become so weak that not only may be unable to advance in face of enemy time may be given to heretic majesty other enemy to interfere there may fall out notable inconvenience with loss of everything be unable to remedy unfortunately english fleet be far le prepared than land force militia have be easily cheaply extemporized fleet can only be prepared by long painful sacrifice entire english navy contained thirteen ship of over four hundred ton including small cutter pinnace there be thirty eight vessel of sort size carrying queen flag fortunately sir john hawkins be at head of naval administration in spite of parsimony of elizabeth have kept fleet in good state of repair equipment merchant navy although numerous be equally deficient in vessel of size philip have encouraged ship building in spain

invasion have parma started in vessel have prepared lord howard who commanded english navy must not have fired shot to have prevented crossing well might sir john hawkins in despair at elizabeth caprice exclaim be wasting money wasting strength dishonouring discrediting by uncertain dallying though daily report came from spain of readiness of armada to set sail elizabeth even when again permitted navy to be manned fettered by allowing to be provided with ration for only month at time permitting reserve to be provided in victualling store while largest vessel be supplied with ammunition for only day half service rest of fleet with enough for one day service council must hing lord howard letter prove that queen only be responsible for miserable state of thing prevailed at

vickars saw coast of ireland fade away from sight without feeling of satisfaction relief hope have be that ship must be wrecked on progress down coast knew not that wild irish be slaying whom sea spared ignorant a be of english tongue must undoubtedly have shared fate of spanish companion thought only of risk of being drowned must have preferred taking to certainty of captivity perhaps for life in spanish prison part that have played since have be picked up off gravelines must not be sustained indefinitely might a well spend life in prison where at least there must be faint hope of being exchanged a wander about spain life a imbecile beggar a soon therefore a saw that peril of coast of ireland be passed that vessel be likely to reach spain in safety determined that must on reaching port disclose real identity there be on board several scotch irish volunteer decided to throw upon pity of one of rather than on of spaniard did not think that in case life be in danger have be detected when first picked up during early part of voyage must doubtless have be thrown overboard without mercy now that passion of combatant have subsided that have be so long among have a believed won good will of many by assistance have rendered to sick wounded thought that there be little fear of life being taken in cold blood one of irish volunteer gerald burke by name have for long time be seriously ill geoffrey have in many small way shown kindness a lay helpless on deck determined finally to confide in although still very weak burke be now convalescent be sitting alone by poop rail gazing upon coast of spain with eager eye when geoffrey under pretext of coiling down rope approached young man nodded kindly to voyage be nearly over poor lad said in spanish trouble now will be worse than mine have given many drink of water from scanty supply wish must do something for in return know that even understand what say to must give opportunity of speaking to after mr burke geoffrey said in english when one will notice speaking irishman gave start of astonishment at hearing addressed in english life be in hand sir pray betray geoffrey said rapidly a went on coiling down

to foundered geoffrey then told how have be knocked off english ship by fall of mast have swum to galleon taken refuge beneath bowsprit until sank how when picked up carried on to spanish ship feigned to have lost sens in order to conceal ignorance of spanish knew said that be recognized a english at time must at once be killed thought that if must conceal who be for time must simply be sent to galley where have heard that there be many english prisoner working think death must have be preferable to lot mr burke said yes sir there be always hope of escape of exchange when spoke kindly to afternoon partly understood what said for in long time have be on board have come to understand little spanish thought that maybe must assist in way must gladly do so though regard englishman a enemy of country in what way can help must furnish with disguise ignorance of spanish must lead to detection immediately have be thinking over sir seemed to that a there will be objection to landing to morrow thinking a do have lost sens might join after once got out of town have money in waistbelt if must purchase clothes for might then join a servant a ride along at next town come to none must know have be in service during voyage there must be nothing strange in irish gentleman being accompanied by irish servant who spoke little spanish must serve faithfully sir until perhaps opportunity

shipmate here see start be not likely that will recognize if do so need simply say that a have shown such kindness on board ship have resolved to take with to madrid in order to see if anything must be done to restore to reason however be better that must keep in background a much a possible will arrange to start at so early hour in morning that none of who may land with from ship may put up at same inn be likely to be about next morning vessel entered port be soon surrounded by boat full of people inquiring anxiously for news of other ship for friend acquaintance on board presently large

geoffrey prospect be bad one altogether if be not that dearly love inez that be sure will be unhappy with philip of sottomayor must give whole thing up make love to daughter of comfortable citizen who must give corner of house seat at table for rest of day seriously geoffrey began well seriously geoffrey intention be to run away with inez if can be managed how be to be managed at present have not faintest idea to begin with daughter of spanish grandee be always kept in very strong cage closely guarded need very large golden key to open now a be aware gold be very scarce commodity with then after getting out lavish expenditure must be needed for flight must have to make way to sea coast to do sort of thing to throw dust into eye of pursuer to get passage to place beyond domain of philip mean to france england netherlands beyond will be question of future subsistence until if ever marquis make up mind to forgive daughter take to heart again contingency in opinion likely to be extremely remote doe lady inez say to geoffrey asked lady inez have have small opportunity of saying anything on subject geoffrey here in spain there be mighty few opportunity for courtship with at home matter be easy enough there be lack of opportunity for pleading suit winning girl heart if be to be won here in spain matter be altogether different unmarried girl be looked after a sharply a if be certain to get into mischief other instant have opportunity be never suffered to be for moment alone with man out of door in have always duenna by side a to private chat thing be simply impossible then how do manage to make love geoffrey asked well very little go long way in spain manner of bow wave of fan dropping of glove flower touch of hand in crowded room of thing go a far a month open love making in ireland then how did manage with duenna so a to be able to speak to in garden well in first place made very attentive to duenna in second place old lady be devout know ireland be land of saint presented with amulet containing paring of nail of st patrick geoffrey burst into laugh in irishman joined well if be not really st patrick latter went on came from ireland anyhow be next best thing then in third place old lady be very fond of inez although be a strict a dragon inez coaxed into belief that there must not be harm in exchanging few word when be close by time to hear what be said now think know a much a do about matter geoffrey will understand that few note have be exchanged that inez love beyond everything be vague uncertain have not slightest idea what will come of week passed nothing be done meeting between gerald burke inez in garden of retiro have ceased day two afterwards duenna having positively refused to allow to continue threatening inez to inform father of unless gave up gerald burke fund dwindled rapidly although geoffrey lived in very closest way what in world be to be done geoffrey have only got twenty dollar left at outside will pay for lodging food for month for life of can not see what be to be done when be gone unless take to road geoffrey shook head a far a be concerned said a be at war with spain must be fair if met spanish ship at sea to capture plunder be afraid law of war justify private plunder must be perfectly ready to go out take service in vineyard to earn living in way if must be managed must rob cardinal if have chance gerald burke said if ever got rich must restore money four fold so obtain absolution only unfortunately see way to robbing cardinal a to digging in field must rather hang at once be constitutionally averse to labour if one once took to sort of thing there must be end to everything be still open to geoffrey said to get friend to obtain commission for must do gerald said moodily of thing be what must most hate might make peace with english government get of estate back again that will not do to feed gerald burke said firmly have thought that if ever carry off inez might for sake do so for own now hope of help from spain be at end cause in ireland be lost be use going on struggling against inevitable be not going to sue english government a beggar for doubt must borrow small sum from irishman scotchman here hold on for few month most of be well nigh a poor a be must not ask besides there must be chance of repaying if be to rob anyone must rather plunder rich don than own countryman of one thing be resolved geoffrey said will not live at expense longer gerald can speak spanish very fairly now can either take service in spanish family a said get work in field gerald laughed dear geoffrey extra expense caused by last week be a far a can calculate one penny for bread a much for fruit rest of living be obtained at expense of friend at rate geoffrey said smiling insist that money be now thrown into common fund have offered several time before always said have best keep for emergency think emergency have come now ten english pound in belt will enable to take step other question be what step might last living a do for three four month at end of time must be absolutely penniless therefore now be time while have still small stock in hand to decide upon something what be to decide upon gerald burke asked helplessly have be thinking over great deal geoffrey said idea be that have best go to cadiz other large port although spain be at war with england netherlands trade still go on in private ship dutch english vessel carry on commerce with spain therefore seems to that there must be merchant in cadiz who must be ready to give employment to men capable of speaking writing in spanish english in case to certain extent in dutch from there too there might be chance of getting passage to england holland if found that impossible owing to vessel being too carefully searched before sailing might at worst take passage a sailor on board spanish ship bound for indie take chance of escape capture there on voyage at least be what planned for think idea be good one geoffrey at rate to cadiz will go know about mercantile business going a sailor must get commission from governor there a well a here in madrid at rate will go donna inez be taken last week by father to estate have somewhere between seville cadiz in order suppose that may be nearer don philip who be hear at last recovering from long illness know that there be slightest use in seeing again will do so if be possible if by miracle must succeed in carrying off cadiz must be more likely place to escape from than anywhere yes know think idea be mad one have never be in love yet when be will know that lover believe in word 'impossible at rate mean to give inez chance of determining own fate if be ready to risk everything rather than marry don philip be ready to share risk whatever may be accordingly on following day gerald burke disposed of greater part of wardrobe belonging purchased two pony for few crown geoffrey with solitary suit of clothes in wallet fastened behind saddle started for journey to cadiz mounted outside city for gerald shrank from meeting acquaintance upon sorry steed a have purchased once on way spirit rose laughed chatted gaily spoke of future a if difficulty be cleared away pony although rough animal be strong sturdy carried rider at good pace sometimes travelled alone sometimes jogged along with party whom overtook by way who have slept in same posadas inn at have put up for night most of inn be very rough to geoffrey astonishingly dirty food consisted generally of bread miscellaneous olio stew from great pot constantly simmering over fire flavour whatever might be being entirely overpowered by of oil garlic be most marked of constituent bed be wholly unknown at place guest simply wrapping in cloak lying down on floor although in few exceptional case bundle of rush be strewn about to form common bed travelling be delightful be now late in autumn when be once past dreary district of la mancha have descended to rich plain of cordova vintage be in full progress harvest everywhere being garnered in mid day meal consisted of bread fruit costing smallest coin eaten by wayside in shade of clump of tree heard many tale on way down of band of robber who infested road having taken precaution of having doubloon for have exchanged geoffrey english gold sewn up in boot have fear of encountering gentry having nothing to lose save wallet few dollar have kept out for expense of journey few jewel gerald burke retained be sewn up in stuffing of saddle after ten day travel reached seville where stayed couple of day where wealth splendour of building surprised geoffrey who have not visited antwerp of great commercial centre of netherlands be strange taste of spanish king observed to gerald burke to plant capital at madrid in centre of barren country when might make such splendid city a capital must see charm in climate be detestable with hot sun bitter cold wind here temperature be delightful air be soft balmy country round be garden there be cathedral worthy of capital seems strange taste gerald agreed believe that when madrid be first planted stood in midst of extensive forest that be merely hunting residence for king then when forest went must have gone too geoffrey said madrid have not even river worthy of name have single point to recommend a far a can see for capital of great empire if be spaniard must certainly take up residence in seville upon following morning again started joining before have ridden many mile party of three merchant travelling with servant to cadiz merchant looked little suspiciously at first at two young men upon rough steed a soon a discovered from first salutation that be foreigner became more cordial welcomed accession of strength to party for carrying of weapon be universal portion of road between seville cadiz particularly unsafe a be traversed by so many merchant wealthy people conversation speedily turned to disturbed state of road think one of merchant said that ordinary band of robber must dare attack looked round with satisfaction at six armed servant who rode behind depends gerald burke said with sly wink at geoffrey upon what value robber may place upon valour of servant a rule serving men be very chary of skin must imagine that robber must be pretty well aware of fact most of be disbanded soldier deserter must say that four of be more than match for six servant must wager that men must make very poor show of if came to fighting there be three self two gentleman merchant said in tone of disquiet well gerald rejoined own that from appearance must not think worshipful sir that fighting be altogether in line now servant young a be have taken part in much fighting in netherlands have have experience with sword if be attacked by robber must naturally stand neutral having nothing to defend having inclination to get throat cut in protecting property of others think that will see for yourselves that be reasonable be soldier of fortune ready to venture life in good service for good pay mightily disinclined to throw away for mere love of fighting chapter xii recruiting fund a soon a gerald burke began conversing with merchant geoffrey fell back took place among servant with whom at once entered into conversation to amuse continued in same strain that have heard gerald adopt towards merchant spoke in term of apprehension of danger of journey of rough treatment have befallen who have ventured to offer opposition to robber be not long in discovering by anxious glance cast round by manner of question that at least of party be not to be relied upon in case of encounter be rather surprised at gerald remaining so long in company with merchant for pace be slow one a be followed by eight heavily laden mule driven by two muleteer must have be much pleasanter thought to have trotted on at usual pace about midday a be passing along edge of thick wood party of men suddenly sprang out ordered to halt geoffrey shouted to men with to come on drawing sword dashed forward two of men only followed others hesitated until shot from musket knocked off one of hat whereupon man comrade turned horse head rode off at full speed merchant have drawn sword stood on defensive geoffrey on reaching be surprised to find gerald burke be sitting quietly on horse without apparent intention of taking part in fight put up sword geoffrey said calmly affair be business of ours have nothing to lose be business of ours to defend money bag of gentleman robber eight in number now rushed up one of merchant glancing round saw that two of men only have come up to assistance muleteer who be probably in league with robber have fled leaving animal standing in road prospect seemed desperate one of merchant be elderly man others be well on middle age mule be laden with valuable good have with considerable sum of money for making purchase at cadiz be time for hesitation will give five hundred crown if will both aid to beat off robber be bargain gerald replied now geoffrey have at fellow leaping from pony ranged by merchant just a robber attacked have not be for aid combat must have be short one for although determined to defend property to last trader have strength skill at arm one be unhorsed at first blow wounded two servant who have also dismounted fought sturdily gerald geoffrey disposed of man before robber who have not reckoned upon interference be prepared to resist attack fight did not last many minute trader did best although by mean formidable opponent distracted attention of robber who be startled by fall of two of party geoffrey received sharp cut on head at same moment ran opponent through body while gerald burke cut down man opposed to other four robber seeing be now outnumbered at once took to heel by st jago one of trader said be stout fighter young men have won fee well methought must have lost life a well a good doubt not must have done so have not ranged yourselves with now let bandage up wound for have received more le hurt when wound of be serious be attended to fallen robber be examined three of be dead man last cut down by gerald burke seemed likely to recover will hang upon tree a warning to knave will take with to next town give in charge of authority there one of trader asked if be must do gerald said must let go free if will tell truth about attack will be just a well for to get to bottom of affair find out whether be chance meeting whether of own people have be in league with be good idea trader agreed will carry out going up to man who have now recovered sens said to sternly have made up mind to hang may save life if will tell how came to set upon speak truth will go free otherwise will finish with without delay robber seeing unexpected chance of escape from punishment at once said that captain of band who be man geoffrey have last run through came out from seville evening before told that one juan campos with whom have long have intimate relation who be clerk to rich trader have upon promise that must receive one fifth of booty taken informed that master with two other merchant be starting on following morning for cadiz with very valuable lot of good twenty five thousand crown intended to lay out in purchase of good brought by galleon have just arrived from indie have arranged to bribe master two servant to ride away when attacked gang also to settle with muleteer so that must take part in affair have reckoned that flight of two of servant must probably affect others have therefore expected rich booty to fall into hand without trouble of striking blow for be well followed suggestion one of trader said to gerald have suspicion of honesty of clerk have not made discovery must doubtless have played similar trick upon other occasion will ride back at once friend for if hears of failure of attack may take alarm make off with can lay hand upon venture be to be in common will leave to to carry out return dismiss campos two rascally servant three trader went apart consulted together presently eldest of party returned to young men have five day journey before said two servant upon whom can place reliance have evidence of unsafety of road a have heard have large sum of money with have already more than earned reward offered friend have agreed with that if will continue to journey with a far a cadiz to give aid of valour must be again attacked will make five hundred crown thousand be large sum have well nigh fortune at stake feel that owe life a well a saving of money must desire nothing better gerald replied will answer with life that good money will arrive safely at cadiz trader then called up two serving men told that on arrival at cadiz must present with hundred crown for having so stoutly done duty employer of treacherous clerk then turned horse head rode back towards seville while others prepared to proceed on way two muleteer have now come out from among bush be busy refastening bale on mule rope having become loosened in struggle of animal while fight be going on merchant have decided to say nothing to men a to discovery that be in league with robber fellow be in alliance with band be scourge to country one of trader said if be to inform authority at next town must in first place be blamed for letting wounded man escape secondly might be detained for day while investigation be going on in country next worse thing to being prisoner be to be complainant law be luxury in wealthy idle can alone afford to indulge a soon therefore a baggage be readjusted party proceeded on way what do think of geoffrey gerald burke asked a rode for short distance by side of supposed servant be magnificent geoffrey replied seems to that real road to wealth in spain be to hire out a guard to traveller ah must not get much if made bargain beforehand be only at moment of urgent danger that fear will open purse string widely have bargained beforehand with trader might have thought lucky if have got ten crown apiece a price of escort to cadiz indeed must have be only too glad if last night offer have be made to when man see that property life be really in danger doe not stop to haggle be content to give handsome percentage of what be risked for aid to save rest well thank goodness money trouble be at end geoffrey said will be long time before need have anxiety on score thing certainly look better gerald said laughing if inez consent to make runaway match of with sha' have to ask to pay expense cadiz be reached without further adventure merchant kept agreement

out whether will follow fortune remain to become day marchesa of sottomayor if adopts former alternative have to arrange plan to carry off to get out of country operation in foresee little difficulty of course if be caught life be forfeited there be question about that question for to consider be how be to set about to carry out respective plan need only consider plan a far a can see geoffrey said of course will do what can to assist if manage to get off safely with young lady will escape at same time not at burke said have only to wait here quietly until see opportunity will go with to morrow to merchant be introduced to to day say that be going away for time will be obliged if will make useful in way until return in way will have sort of established position here can wait until see chance of smuggling on board english dutch vessel mine be very different affair may talk lightly of be perfectly aware that run tremendous risk that chance be very strongly against whatever chance be geoffrey said quietly will share with kindness have saved from what at best might have be imprisonment for life not improbably must have be torture death at hand of inquisition be certainly not going to withdraw from now when be entering upon what be undoubtedly very dangerous adventure if escape from spain escape together if not fate befalls be ready to risk very well so be geoffrey gerald burke said holding out hand to if mind be made up will not argue question with indeed value companionship aid too highly to try to shake determination let then at once talk over what be now joint enterprise ribaldo estate lie about way between seville passed within few mile of a came hither first thing of course will be to procure sort of disguise in can see inez have talk with now seems to for have be thinking matter over in way a rode that only disguise in must be possible must be that of priest monk geoffrey laughed aloud must in first place have to shave off moustachio gerald fear that even after have done so there must be nothing venerable in appearance whatever mission with might pretend to charge chance of obtaining private interview with lady must be slight be afraid must lack odour of sanctity geoffrey what else can one do think over man way in played idiot when be picked out of water show that be quick at contriving plan be simple business in comparison to geoffrey replied however be not pressed for time will think over to night may light upon possible scheme for own at present have not least idea how matter be to be managed a in morning there be several other traveller taking breakfast in same room conversation be not renewed until gerald burke strolled out followed at respectful distance by geoffrey who still passed a servant reached quiet spot on rampart here geoffrey joined stood for minute looking over sea what magnificent position for city geoffrey said at last standing on rocky tongue of land jutting out at entrance to splendid bay ought to be impregnable since can only be attacked on side facing that sandy isthmus what number of ship be lying up bay what busy scene be with boat passing repassing though must be two mile away fancy can hear shout of sailor yes be very fine gerald said have seen several time before still can make allowance for do see group of small ship mile beyond others be english dutchman be allowed to trade a see be kept apart there be three war galley lying close to one be allowed to land boat going off be strictly examined who go on board have to show permit from governor to trade so see chance of getting on board one of be slight indeed higher up bay lie puerto de santa maria where great trade be carried on much wine shipped though more come from jeres lie up river know passed through on way here yes be splendid position for trade suppose commerce carried on here be larger than in port in europe though antwerp ranked a first until trouble began in netherlands ought to be first have trade of atlantic sea board standing at mouth of mediterranean command also while wealth of new world pours in here be great already there be saying what will be in future while day trade from far east must flow in here also by vessel trading round south of africa cadiz have one fault space on stand be too small for great city see how close house stand together how narrow be street can not spread without extending beyond rock over sand then strength must be gone must be open to capture by enterprising enemy having command of sea there now having indulged humour let return to more important matter have thought over what be talking about last night have certainly thought over geoffrey said know that thinking have resulted in much only plan occurs to a being at possible be be talking in joke at madrid of turning robber must be possible think to get together small band of men to aid in carrying off young lady from ground of father house while journeying on road must then have talk with if find willing to fly with must leave men have engaged journey across country in sort of disguise to port if objected must conduct back to neighbourhood of house allow to return there be one difficulty must

seville cadiz there be irish college at place there be several priest whom knew before entered church who must be sure perform service for on ordinary occasion be different thing asking to take share in such business a for must render liable to sort of penalty punishment from superior however difficulty must be got over somehow at rate plan seems to promise better than anything have thought of first difficulty be how to get ruffian for such business can not go up to first beetle browed knave meet in street say to be disposed to aid in abduction of lady geoffrey laughed fortunately have intermediary ready at hand how so gerald exclaimed in surprise why how on earth can have acquaintance with ruffian in cadiz not very intimate acquaintance gerald if take trouble to go into court yard of inn when get back will see one of rascally muleteer who be in league with robber who attacked on way be in conversation when came out with man who breakfasted with be probably bargaining for load for mule back to seville have doubt that through might put into communication with cutthroat of town be capital idea geoffrey will have talk with man a soon a get back for if be not still there be sure to be able to learn from of men about stable where to find must go very carefully to work gerald geoffrey said must never do to let of fellow know exact object for engaged for might be sure of getting far larger sum from marquis for divulging plan to carry off daughter than must afford to pay for service quite see will be careful on return to inn gerald burke at once made inquiry a to muleteer learned that must probably return in hour to see if bargain must be made with trader for hire of mule back to seville gerald waited about until man came want to have talk with friend said muleteer looked at with suspicious eye be busy said in surly tone have time to waste must not be wasting if be to lead to putting dozen crown in pocket oh if be to lead to senor can spare hour for think that anything be likely to come out of job came here to try to arrange will walk away to quieter place gerald said there be too many people about here for to talk comfortably rampart be two three minute walk can talk there without interruption when arrived upon rampart gerald commenced conversation think be foolish friend not to have taken into confidence other day before little affair must have made opportunity well enough stopped to luncheon if have drawn aside told frankly that friend of yours be about to make attack upon trader that must guarantee that must make worth while what do mean by saying friend have knowledge of affair beforehand man asked furiously say so gerald replied because have on excellent authority wounded robber made clean breast of whole affair of share in a well a of rascally clerk of one of trader if have not be for merchant must have handed over to magistrate at place where stopped that night dissuaded upon ground that must have to attend a witness against that be not worth while to lose valuable time merely for pleasure of seeing hung however be beside question what be saying be be pity did not say to frankly presence here be inopportune if will stand apart if unexpected affair take place will get say two thousand crown out of twenty five thousand friend be going to capture have done that see thing might have turned out differently did not know muleteer stammered did not know for certain of course be soldier of fortune if have be sharp might have guessed however be too late for now now what wanted to ask be if must get dozen of friend to take service under in little adventure have to carry out will be well paid suppose will have much trouble over what must pay cabbalero muleteer asked humbly for have be greatly impressed with valour displayed by young irishman servant in fray thought that intended to get together company for adventure on road in case might be able to have profitable dealing with in future will give

instead of entering at once rode on mile further fastened horse up in wood gerald must have left there alone geoffrey insisted on staying with for night care nothing about sleeping in open air gerald must be folly to risk success of enterprise upon chance of one happening to come through wood finding animal before return in morning have hearty meal at seville will do very well until morning gerald

married to must never have run away have not insisted on marrying man hated will of course beg to forgive fear never will must hope that will inez that will ask to come back to spain sometimes care for know for a have told estate in ireland be amply large enough for want will be glad for sake that must be reconciled to inez shook head know father gerald must never go back to spain again not if promised to give whole fortune father never forgives be to entice back to spain must be only to shut up to obtain dispensation from rome annulling marriage must have difficulty in doing have got will

satisfaction be evinced by abundance of food supplied meal being frequently supplemented by fruit other little luxury severely a laboured geoffrey companion be comparatively happy short a be time that former have worked with gang appreciated liberty now enjoyed especially congratulated upon being spared painful life of galley slave at sea a to boldero change from prison with companion hated degrading work coarse scanty food made new man of have be two twenty when captured by spaniard be now in prime of life strength work have seemed very hard to geoffrey at first be to a play while companionship of countryman freedom from constant surveillance absence of care abundance excellence of food filled with new life lady of boy household often sat listened to strange song rose from slave toiling in garden a work approached conclusion geoffrey companion have many talk over what must next befall there be one reason only that weighed in favour of life with slave gang in present position there be possibility so far a must discern of effecting escape whereas a slave must galley in rowed be overpowered by ship attacked must obtain freedom chance of however be remote a fast rowing galley must almost always make escape must vessel attacked prove too strong to be captured when last bed have be levelled last shrub planted superintendent told to follow into house a bey be desirous of speaking with found seated on divan christian said have watched while have be at work truly have not spared yourselves in service have laboured for with strength well willingly see now that be true that people of nation differ much from spaniard who be dog see that trust be to be placed in be true believer must appoint to position where must win credit honour a be can not place over believer in prophet be willing that must return to gang from took will therefore leave free to work for yourselves there be many of friend who have seen labouring will give employment will be known in place that be under protection that who insult ill treat will be severely punished must have complaint to make come freely to will see that justice be done evening crier will go through place proclaiming that two english galley slave have be given freedom by will henceforth live in town without molestation from anyone carrying on work selling labour like true believer crier will inform

hire little house for furnish with what be needful to recommend to neighbour to give purse of piastre with to maintain yourselves until work come to stephen boldero expressed warmest gratitude on part of companion to bey for kindness have done simple justice bey said thanks be necessary faithful work must have reward a have done to so do to next morning a be leaving female slave presented with purse of silver gift of bey wife daughter who have often derived much pleasure from song of two captive superintendent conducted to small hut facing sea be furnished with few article be according to native idea necessary for comfort there be cushion on divan of baked clay raised about foot above floor served a sofa during day a bed at night there be small piece of carpet on floor few cooking utensil on shelf dish of burnt clay nothing more be required there be however small chest in after superintendent have left found two set of garment a worn by native be comfort indeed geoffrey said clothes be in rag a for yours le say about better will feel like new man in thing will be glad stephen agreed for clothes give galley slave be scarce decent for christian man to wear consolation have be that if have be shocked by appearance must have given more clothes a did not mind there be reason why must still must be comfort to be cleanly decent again for first few day native of place looked askance at christian in midst bey order have be peremptory that insult must be offered to two day after liberation one of principal men of place sent for employed in digging foundation for fountain deep trench of hundred yard in length for pipe for bringing water to after that have many similar job receiving always wage paid to regular workman giving great satisfaction by steady toil sometimes when not otherwise engaged went out in boat with fisherman receiving portion of catch in payment of labour so month passed away very frequently talked over method of escape only plan seemed at possible be to take boat make out to sea knew that must be pursued if overtaken must revert to former life at galley change must be terrible one indeed after present life of freedom independence knew too that might be day before meeting with ship for trader in mediterranean hugged northern shore a much a possible in order to avoid dreaded corsair there must be far greater chance of being recaptured by one of moorish cruiser than of lighting upon christian trader be question of chance stephen said when chance come will seize be use giving up life against there be not much to be said unless fair prospect of escape offer to chapter xvi escape in one respect geoffrey said a be talking over chance of escape be sorry that bey have behaved so kindly to what be stephen boldero asked in surprise well be thinking that be not for might manage to contrive plan of escape in concert with galley slave get down to shore here row off to galley overpower three four men who live on board make off with of course must have have to accumulate beforehand quantity of food barrel of water for have noticed that when go out always take store on board with bring on shore on return what have not be consumed still suppose must be managed however seems to that hand be tied in direction by kindness of bey after conduct to must be ungrateful in extreme for to carry off galley so must geoffrey besides doubt whether plan must succeed may be sure spaniard be a jealous a can be of good fortune that have met with be to propose scheme to chance be strongly in favour of one of trying to better own position by denouncing must only trust a far a can see if ever do anything must be done by there be doubt that if night when there be strong wind blowing from south east be to get on board one of fishing boat hoist sail run before must not be far off from coast of spain before started to look for what better must be there can talk spanish well enough must not pas a spaniard besides must find out soon enough that be not catholic where must be then sent to row in galley clapped into dungeon of inquisition like enough burnt alive at stake must be out of frying pan into fire with vengeance think might pas a spaniard geoffrey said for there be great deal of difference between dialect of different province confined a have be for last ten year with spanish sailor must have caught way of talking still agree with will be better to wait for bit longer for chance may occur rather than risk landing in spain again where even if passed a native must have a hard work to get living a have here with greater chance of making way home again during time that have be captive three four vessel have be brought in by corsair men composing crew have be either sold a slave to moor arab in interior sent to algiers town lay over hundred mile to east be of various nationality spanish french italian a two friend learned from talk of native for always abstained from going near point where prisoner be landed a be powerless to assist unfortunate captive in way sight of distress be very painful to one day however learned from people who be running down to shore to see captive landed from ship have be brought in by corsair during night that there be two three woman among captive be first time that female have be captured since arrival at place for woman seldom travelled far from home in day except wife of high official journeying in great ship be safe from attack of moorish corsair let go down see boldero said have not seen face of white woman for nine year will go if like geoffrey said will not guess that be european for be burnt a dark a moor went down to landing place eight men two woman be landed from boat be sole survivor of crew be spaniard boldero said pity that poor girl suppose other woman be servant girl who be about sixteen year of age be very pale have evidently be cry terribly did not seem to heed cry threat with townspeople a usual assailed newly arrived captive kept eye fixed upon one of captive who walked before be father doubt geoffrey said be probably last look at come away stephen be awfully sorry came here will not be able to get girl face out of mind for know how long without word went back to hut have particular work day geoffrey went restlessly in out sometimes pacing along strand sometimes coming in throwing on divan stephen boldero went on quietly mending net have be damaged night before saying nothing glancing occasionally with amused look at companion restless movement late in afternoon geoffrey burst out suddenly stephen must try rescue girl somehow from fate supposed be what be coming to boldero said quietly well let hear about know have be thinking over ever since morning what be idea know have idea beyond getting father down to boat making off well certainly have not done much if have got farther than stephen said drily now if have spent day talking over with instead of wandering about like one out of mind must have got great deal further than by time however have be thinking for know what young fellow be a soon a saw that girl face looked at be dead certain there be end of peace quietness that must be bent upon plan of getting off did not need five minute to show be right have be spending time thinking while have thrown yours away in fidgeting well think be worth trying of course will be vastly more difficult job getting girl father away than just taking boat sailing off a have often talked of doing then on other hand must altogether alter position afterwards by appearance hers have doubt be well to do trader perhaps wealthy one walked with head upright when crowd be yelling cursing be evidently man of courage determination now if have reached spanish coast by must have be questioned right left a have said along must soon have found that be not spaniard for must not have said where came from given past history said where family lived must be altogether different if landed with one must be interested about must only be two poor devil of sailor who have escaped with must help to pas off get employment so that difficulty have hitherto prevented from trying to escape be very greatly diminished now a to getting away of course have be taken up to bey doubt will send a present to bey of algiers know be have be done several time before when young woman have be captured have be thinking over see possibility of getting to speak to a long a be at bey see that can be done anyhow will be indoors most of time if must go into garden there must be other woman with only plan a far a can see at present must be to carry off from escort on journey suppose will have more than two at most three mounted men with ought to be able to dispose of a to father matter be comparatively easy know way of prison have doubt can get out somehow only there be trouble of question of time have got to be rescued brought back hidden somewhere till nightfall have got to be set free same evening have to embark early enough to be well out of sight before daylight maybe there will not be breath of wind stirring be tough job geoffrey look at way will be tough job geoffrey agreed be afraid escort must be stronger than think present of kind to bey be regarded a important must say dozen horseman at least will be sent with in case attempt at rescue must be hopeless have arm if have must not kill six mounted men if even one escaped plan must be defeated question be must send by land seems to quite a likely that might send by water yes be likely enough geoffrey in case everything must depend upon vessel sent in if be great galley there be end of if be one of little coaster might be managed be sure to learn that before long bey might keep for fortnight so perhaps longer for to recover somewhat from trouble get up good look again so a to add to value of present if be well bright must be pretty enough for anything in meantime can arrange plan for getting father away of course if go with big escort on horseback if go in galley there be end of plan be ready to help geoffrey if there be chance of success be not going to throw away life if there be not unless go down in coaster there be end of scheme quite agree to geoffrey replied can not accomplish impossibility learned upon following day that three of newly arrived captive be to take place of galley slave who have be killed in capture of spanish ship have defended stoutly that others be to be sold for work in interior be pretty certain boldero said that trader will not be one of three chosen for galley work must break down in month make that part of business easier for can get away on journey inland hide up here until daughter be sent off geoffrey looked round bare room well say a how must hide here boldero said in answer to look might hide somewhere among sand hill outside place take food at night yes might do geoffrey agreed must be managed easily enough must think for there be clump of bush scattered over sand hill mile back from sea trouble will be if get here find after that can not rescue daughter will make difference boldero said in case will make off with alone everything else will go on just same of course must be very sorry not to save girl a far a be concerned if save father will answer purpose geoffrey made reply just at moment own future be very secondary matter in comparison to rescue of unhappy spanish girl geoffrey companion have be in habit of going up occasionally to prison have won over guard by small present be permitted to go in out with fruit other little luxury for galley slave now abstained from going near place in order that suspicion might fall upon after escape of having have communication with spanish trader shortly after arrival of captive two merchant from interior came down geoffrey learned that have visited prison have made bargain with bey for captive except transferred to galley two companion have talked matter over frequently have concluded be best that only one of must be engaged in adventure for absence of might be noticed after discussion be agreed that geoffrey must undertake task that boldero must go alone to house where be now at work must mention that friend be unwell be obliged to remain at home for day a knew direction in captive must be taken geoffrey started before daybreak kept steadily along until reached spot where be probable must halt for night be twenty mile away there be here well of water grove of tree late in afternoon saw party approaching consisted of merchant two armed arab five captive of whom be carrying burden be crawling painfully along overpowered by heat of sun by length of journey by weight carried several time arab struck heavily with stick to force to keep up geoffrey retired from other side of clump of tree lay down in depression of sand hill until darkness came on when again entered grove crawling cautiously forward made way close up to party fire be blazing meal have be already cooked eaten trader two arab be sitting by fire captive be lying extended on ground presently at command of one of arab rose to foot proceeded to collect more piece of wood for fire a returned light fell on gray hair of man upon whom geoffrey have noticed that girl eye be fixed noted place where lay down have nothing to do now to wait until party be asleep felt sure that guard must be set for attempt on part of captive to escape must be nothing short of madness there be nowhere for to go must simply wander about until died of hunger exhaustion until be recaptured in case must be almost beaten to death in hour time trader men lay down by fire be quiet geoffrey crawled round until be close to spaniard waited until felt sure that arab be asleep then crawled up to man started a touched silence senor geoffrey whispered in spanish be friend have come to rescue care not for life few day of work will kill sooner better have nothing to live for killed wife other day daughter be captive in hand thank whoever be will not go be going to try to save daughter too geoffrey whispered have plan for carrying off word gave new life to spaniard in case sir be ready whoever

advantage of falling off in spanish commerce have indeed herself suffered enormously by emigration of ten of thousand of most intelligent of population owing to persecution of protestant trader manufacturer largely belonged to new religion have carried industry knowledge to england holland thus religious bigotry of king of spain france have resulted in enormous loss to trade commerce of country in corresponding advantage to protestant rival geoffrey vickars partner reaped full benefit of change extensive acquaintance of spanish trader with merchant in mediterranean port enabled to turn large share of new current of trade into hand of geoffrey capital transferred from spain to england be very much larger than employed by majority of english merchant whose wealth have be small indeed in comparison to of merchant prince of great centre of trade such a antwerp amsterdam genoa cadiz geoffrey vickars soon came to be looked upon a one of leading merchant in city of london there can be doubt geoffrey brother said a lay on couch in garden in early day of convalescence looked at river dotted with boat flowed past falling of mast be fortunate thing for one never can tell how

make assault with whole force vere knew that must scarcely hope to repel called council of chief officer asked opinion whether with present number part of work must be manned in case of assault if not whether be advisable to withdraw guard from outlying position to hold only town be unanimously of opinion that force be too small to defend whole sir horace vere sir john ogle alone gave advice to

up hill for now ground grew very bad indeed instead of soft turf springy heather met great patch of flat limestone rock just like ill made pavement with deep crack between stone ledge filled with fern so have to hop from stone to stone now then slipped in between hurt little bare toe though be tolerably tough one still must go on up must not tell why what must tom have said if have seen walking over moor behind very same irishwoman who have taken part upon road whether be that looked too little behind whether be that kept out of sight behind rock knoll never saw though saw now began to get

must see nothing to eat anywhere still le to drink heath be full of bilberry whimberries be only in flower yet for be june a for water who can find on top of limestone rock now then passed by deep dark swallow hole going down into earth a if be chimney of dwarf house underground more than once a passed must hear water falling trickling tinkling many many foot below how longed to get down to cool poor baked lip brave little chimney sweep a be dared not climb down such chimney a so went on on till head spun round with heat thought heard church bell ringing long way off ah thought where there be church there will be house people perhaps one will give bit sup so set off again to look for church for be sure that heard bell quite plain in minute more when looked round stopped again said why what big place world be so be for from top of mountain must see what must not see behind far below be harthover dark wood shining salmon river on left far below be town smoking chimney of colliery far far away river widened to shining sea little white speck be ship lay on bosom before lay spread out like map great plain farm village amid dark knot of tree seemed at very foot have sense to see that be long mile away to right rose moor after moor hill after hill till faded away blue into blue sky between moor really at very foot lay something to a soon a tom saw determined to go for be place for deep deep green rocky valley very narrow filled with wood through wood hundred of foot below must see clear stream glance oh if must get down to stream then by stream saw roof of little cottage little garden set out in square bed there be tiny little red thing moving in garden no bigger than fly a tom looked down saw that be woman in red petticoat ah perhaps must give something to eat there be church bell ringing again surely there must be village down there well nobody must know what have happened at place news must not have got there yet even if sir john have set policeman in county

minute for cottage be more than mile off good thousand foot below illustration play by bathe in mother child p however down went like brave little man a be though be very footsore tired hungry thirsty while church bell rang so loud began to think that must be inside own head river chimed tinkled far below be song sang clear cool clear cool by laughing willow dreaming pool cool clear cool clear by shining shingle foaming wear under crag where ouzel sings ivied wall where church bell ring undefiled for undefiled play by bathe in mother child dank foul dank foul by smoky town in murky cowl foul

after have slept exactly a long a be good for found swimming about in stream being about four inch may be accurate inch long having round parotid region of fauces set of external gill hope understand big word just like of sucking eft mistook for lace frill till pulled at found hurt made up mind that be part of best left alone in fact fairy have turned into water baby water baby never heard of water baby perhaps not be very reason why story be written there be great many thing in world never heard of great many more nobody ever heard of great many thing too nobody will ever hear of at least until coming of cocqcigrues when man will be measure of thing there be such thing a water baby how do know have be there to see if have be there to see have seen none must not prove that there be none if mr garth doe not find fox in eversley wood a folk sometimes fear never will doe not prove that there be such thing a fox a be eversley wood to wood in england so be water know to water in world one have right to say that water baby exist till have seen water baby existing be quite different thing mind from not seeing water baby thing nobody ever did perhaps ever will do surely if there be water baby somebody must have caught one at least well how do know that somebody have not must have put into spirit into illustrated news perhaps cut into two half poor dear little thing sent one to professor owen one to professor huxley to see what must say about ah dear little man doe not follow at a will see before end of story water baby be contrary to nature well dear little man must learn to talk about such thing when grow older in very different way from that must not talk about ai ca when speak of great wonderful world round of wisest man know only very smallest corner be a great sir isaac newton said only child picking up pebble on shore of boundless ocean must not say that can not be that be contrary to nature know what nature be what can do nobody know not even sir roderick murchison professor owen professor sedgwick professor huxley mr darwin professor faraday mr grove other of great men whom good boy be taught to respect be very wise men must listen respectfully to say even if must say be sure never must can not exist be contrary to nature must wait little see for perhaps even may be wrong be only child who read aunt agitate argument cousin cramchild conversation lad who go to popular lecture see man pointing at few big ugly picture on wall making nasty smell with bottle squirt for hour two calling that anatomy chemistry who talk about can not exist contrary to nature wise men be afraid to say that there be anything contrary to nature except what be contrary to mathematical truth for two two can not make five two straight line can not join twice part can not be a great a whole so on at least so seems at present wiser men be le talk about can not be very rash dangerous word can not if people use too often queen of fairy who make cloud thunder flea bite take just a much trouble about one a about other be apt to astonish suddenly by showing that though say can not yet can what be more will whether approve not therefore be that there be dozen hundred of thing in world must certainly have said be contrary to nature if did not see going on under eye day long if people have never seen little seed grow into great plant tree of quite different shape from tree again produce fresh seed to grow into fresh tree must have said thing can not be be contrary to nature must have be quite a right in saying so a in saying that most other thing can not be suppose again that have come like m du chaillu traveller from unknown part that human being have ever seen heard of elephant suppose that described to people said be shape plan anatomy of beast of foot of trunk of grinder of tusk though be not tusk at two fore teeth run mad be section of skull more like mushroom than reasonable skull of reasonable unreasonable beast so forth so forth though beast assure have seen shot be first cousin to little hairy coney of scripture second cousin to pig suspect thirteenth fourteenth cousin to rabbit yet be wisest of beast can do everything save read write cast account people must surely have said nonsense elephant be contrary to nature have thought be telling story a french thought of le vaillant when came back to paris said that have shot giraffe a king of cannibal island thought of english sailor when said that in country water turned to marble rain fell a feather must tell more knew of science elephant be impossible monster contrary to law of comparative anatomy a far a yet known to must answer le more thought did not learned men too hold till within last twenty five year that flying dragon be impossible monster do not now know that there be hundred of found fossil up down world people call pterodactyles be only because be ashamed to call flying dragon after denying so long that flying dragon must exist truth be that folk fancy that such such thing can not be simply because have not seen be worth no more than savage fancy that there can not be such thing a locomotive because never saw one running wild in forest wise men know that business be to examine what be not to settle what be not know that there be elephant know that there have be flying dragon wiser be le inclined will be to say positively that there be water baby water baby indeed why wise men of old said that everything on earth have double in water may see that be if not quite true still quite a true a most other theory be likely to hear for many day there be land baby then why not water baby be there not water rat water fly water cricket water crab water tortoise water scorpion water tiger water hog water cat water dog sea lion sea bear sea horse sea elephant sea mouse sea urchin sea razor sea pen sea comb sea fan of plant be there not water grass water crowfoot water milfoil so on without end thing be only nickname water thing be not really akin to land thing be not always true be in million of case not only of same family actually same individual creature even know that green drake alder fly dragon fly live under water till change skin just a tom changed if water animal can continually change into land animal why must not land animal sometimes change into water animal be put down by of cousin cramchild argument stand up to like man answer quite respectfully of course thus if cousin cramchild say that if there be water baby must grow into water men ask how know that then how know that must more than proteus of adelsberg cavern grows into perfect newt if say that be too strange transformation for land baby to turn into water baby ask if ever heard of transformation of syllis distomas common jelly fish of m quatrefages say excellently well who must not exclaim that miracle have come to pas if saw reptile come out of egg dropped by hen in poultry yard reptile give birth at once to indefinite number of fish bird yet history of jelly fish be quite a wonderful a must be ask if know about if doe not tell to go look for advise very respectfully of course to settle more what strange thing can not happen till have seen what strange thing do happen day if say that thing can not degrade be change downwards into lower form ask who told that water baby be lower than land baby even if be doe know about strange degradation of common goose barnacle one find sticking on ship bottom still stranger degradation of cousin of theirs of one hardly like to talk so shocking ugly be lastly if say a most certainly will that transformation only take place in lower animal not in higher say that seems to little boy to grown people very strange fancy for if change of lower animal be so wonderful so difficult to discover why must not there be change in higher animal far more wonderful far more difficult to discover may not man crown flower of thing undergo change a much more wonderful than rest a great exhibition be more wonderful than rabbit burrow let answer if say a will that not having seen change in experience be not bound to believe ask respectfully where microscope have be doe not of in coming into world go through transformation just a wonderful a of sea egg butterfly reason analogy a well a scripture tell that transformation be not last though what will be know not yet be here a crawling caterpillar will be hereafter a perfect fly old greek heathen a be saw a much a two thousand year ago care very little for cousin cramchild if see even le than so forth so forth till be quite cross then tell that if there be water baby at least there ought to be at least can not answer meanwhile dear little man till know great deal more about nature than professor owen professor huxley put together tell about what can not be fancy that anything be too wonderful to be true be fearfully wonderfully made said old david so be so be everything around down to very deal table yes much more fearfully wonderfully made already be table a stand now nothing piece of dead deal wood than if a fox say goose believe spirit must make dance talk to by rapping on be in earnest oh dear know that be fairy tale fun pretence that be not to believe one word of even if be true at event so happened to tom therefore keeper groom sir john made great mistake be very unhappy sir john at least without reason when found black thing in water said be tom body that have be drowned be utterly mistaken tom be quite alive cleaner merrier than ever have be fairy have washed see in swift river so thoroughly

cometh from afar not in entire forgetfulness not in utter nakedness trailing cloud of glory do come from god who be home there can know more than if be must believe that for then great fairy science who be likely to be queen of fairy for many year to come can only do good never do harm instead of fancying with people that body make soul a if steam engine must make own coke with people that soul have nothing to do with body be only stuck into like pin into pin cushion to fall out with first shake will believe one true orthodox inductive rational deductive philosophical seductive logical productive irrefragable salutary nominalistic comfortable realistic on account to be received doctrine of wonderful fairy tale be that soul make body just a snail make shell for rest be enough for to

above felt very happy though must not well tell why of course must have be very cold sitting there on september night without least bit of clothes on wet back tom be water baby therefore felt cold no more than fish suddenly saw beautiful sight bright red light moved along river side threw down into water long tap root of flame tom curious little rogue that be must need go see what be so swam to shore met light a stopped over willow run at edge of low rock there underneath light lay five six great salmon looking up at flame with great goggle eye wagging tail a if be very much pleased at came to top to look at wonderful light nearer made splash heard voice say there be fish rose did not know what word meant seemed to know sound of to know voice spoke saw on bank three great two legged

then said tak ' muckle fellow lad be ower fifteen punds haud hand steady tom felt that there be danger coming longed to warn foolish salmon who kept staring up at light a if be bewitched before must make up mind down came pole through water there be fearful splash struggle tom saw that poor salmon be speared right through be lifted out of water then from behind there sprang on three men three other men there be shout blow word tom recollected to have heard before shuddered turned sick at now for felt somehow that be strange ugly wrong horrible began to come back to be men be fighting savage desperate up down fighting such a tom have seen too many time before stopped little ear longed to swim away be very glad that be water baby have nothing to do more with horrid dirty men with foul clothes on back foul word on lip dared not stir out of hole while rock shook over head with trampling struggling of keeper poacher of sudden there be tremendous splash frightful flash hissing be still for into water close to tom fell one of men who held light in hand into swift river sank rolled over over in current tom heard men above run along seemingly looking for drifted down into deep hole below there lay quite still must not find tom waited long time till be quiet then peeped out saw man lying at last screwed up courage swam down to perhaps thought water have made fall asleep a

for twenty four hour like grime so when grow to be big man do behave a honest fellow must never touch fish head of game belongs to man without express leave then people will call gentleman treat like one perhaps give good sport instead of hitting into river calling poaching snob then tom went on down for be afraid of staying near grime a went vale looked sad red yellow leaf showered down into river fly beetle be dead gone chill autumn fog lay low upon hill sometimes spread so thickly on river that must not see way felt way instead following flow of stream day after day past great bridge past boat barge past great town with wharf mill tall smoking chimney ship rode at anchor in stream now then ran against hawser wondered what be peeped out saw sailor lounging on board smoking pipe ducked under again for be terribly afraid of being caught by man turned into chimney sweep once more did not know that fairy be close to always shutting sailor eye lest must see turning aside from

here come to very saddest part of story know people will only laugh at call much ado about nothing know one man who must not be officer with pair of grey moustache a long a arm who said once in company that two of most heart rending sight in world moved most to tear must do anything to prevent remedy be child over broken toy child stealing sweet company did not laugh at moustache be too long

wondering when strange lady must come again give what must give how much whether must give more than others thought of nothing lollipop by day dreamt of nothing else by night what happened then that began to watch lady to see where kept sweet thing began hiding sneaking following about pretending to be looking other way going after something else till found out that kept in beautiful mother of pearl cabinet away in deep crack of rock longed to go to cabinet yet be afraid then longed again be le afraid at last by continual thinking about longed so violently that be not afraid at one night when other child be asleep must not sleep for thinking of lollipop crept away among rock got to cabinet behold be open when saw nice thing inside instead of being delighted be quite frightened wished have never come there then must only touch did then must only taste one did then must only eat one did then must only eat two then three so on then be terrified lest must come catch began gobbling down so fast that did not taste have pleasure in then felt sick must have only one more then only one more again so on till have eaten up while close behind stood mr bedonebyasyoudid people may say why did not keep cupboard locked well know may seem very strange thing never doe keep cupboard locked one may go taste for fare accordingly be very odd so be be quite sure that know best perhaps wish people to keep finger out of fire by having burned took off spectacle because did not like to see too much in pity arched up eyebrow into very hair eye grew so wide that must have taken in sorrow of world filled with great big tear a too often do said be ah poor little dear be just like rest said to herself tom heard saw now must not fancy that be sentimental at if do think that be going to let off human being when do wrong because be too tender hearted to punish then will find very much mistaken a many man doe year day what did strange fairy do when saw lollipop eaten did fly at tom catch by scruff of neck hold howk hump hurry hit poke pull pinch pound put in corner shake slap set on cold stone to reconsider so forth not bit may watch at work if know where to find will never see do for if have knew quite well tom must have fought kicked bit said bad word turned again that moment into naughty little heathen chimney sweep with hand like ishmael of old against man man hand against did question hurry frighten threaten to make confess not bit may see a said at work often enough if know where to look for will never see do for if have must have tempted to tell lie in fright must have be worse for if possible than even becoming heathen chimney sweep again leaf that for anxious parent teacher lazy one call who instead of giving child fair trial such a must expect demand for force by fright to confess own fault be so cruel unfair that judge on bench dare do to wickedest thief murderer for good british law forbids ay even punish to make confess be so detestable crime that be never committed now save by inquisitor king of naples few other wretched people of whom world be weary then say have trained up child in way must go when grew up have departed from why then did solomon say that must not depart from perhaps way of beating hurrying frightening questioning be not way that child must go for be not even way in colt must go if want to break in make quiet serviceable horse folk may say ah fairy doe not need to do that if know everything already true if did not know must not surely behave worse than british judge jury more must parent teacher so just said nothing at about matter not even when tom came next day with rest for sweet thing be horribly afraid of coming be still more afraid of staying away lest one must suspect be dreadfully afraid too lest there must be sweet a be to be expected having eaten lest then fairy must inquire who have taken behold pulled out just a many a ever astonished tom frightened still more when fairy looked full in face shook from head to foot however gave share like rest thought within that must not have found out when put sweet into mouth hated taste of made so sick that have to get away a fast a must terribly sick be very cross unhappy week after then when next week came have share again again fairy looked full in face more sadly than have ever looked must not bear sweet took again in spite of when mr doasyouwouldbedoneby came wanted to be cuddled like rest said very seriously must like to cuddle can not be so horny prickly tom looked at be over prickle just like sea egg be quite natural for must know believe that people soul make body just a snail make shell be not joking little man be in serious solemn earnest therefore when tom soul grew prickly with naughty temper body must not help growing prickly too so that nobody must cuddle play with even like to look at what must tom do now go away hide in corner cry for nobody must play with knew full well why be so miserable week when ugly fairy came looked at once more full in face more seriously sadly than ever must stand no longer thrust sweetmeat away saying want ca bear now then burst out cry poor little man told mr bedonebyasyoudid word a happened be horribly frightened when have done so for expected to punish very severely instead only took up kissed be not quite pleasant for chin be very bristly indeed be so lonely hearted thought that rough kissing be better than none will forgive little man said always forgive one moment tell truth of own accord then will take away nasty prickle be very different matter put there only can take away how can do asked tom cry afresh well think be time for to go to school so will fetch schoolmistress who will teach how to get rid of prickle so went away tom be frightened at notion of schoolmistress for thought must certainly come with birch rod cane comforted at last that might be something like old woman in vendale be not in least for when fairy brought be most beautiful little girl that ever be seen with long curl floating behind like golden cloud long robe floating round like silver one there be said fairy must teach to be good whether like not know said little girl did not seem quite to like for put finger in mouth looked at tom under brow tom put finger in mouth looked at under brow for be horribly ashamed of little girl seemed hardly to know how to begin perhaps must never have begun at if poor tom have not burst out cry begged to teach to be good help to cure prickle at grew so tender hearted that began teaching a prettily a ever child be taught in world did little girl teach tom taught first what have be taught ever since said first prayer at mother knee taught much more simply for lesson in world child have such hard word in a lesson in therefore water baby like better than like lesson long to learn more more grown men can not puzzle quarrel over meaning a do here on land for lesson rise clear pure like test out of overton pool out of everlasting ground of life truth so taught tom day in week only on sunday always went away home kind fairy took place before have taught tom many sunday prickle have vanished quite away skin be smooth clean again dear said little girl why know now be very same little chimney sweep who came into bedroom dear cried tom know too now be very little white lady whom saw in bed jumped at longed to hug kiss did not remembering that be lady born so only jumped round round till be quite tired then began telling other story how have got into water have fallen over rock how have swum down to sea how have flown out of window how other till be talked out then began over again ca say of two talked fastest then set to work at lesson again liked so well that went on well till seven full year be past gone may fancy that tom be quite content happy seven year truth be be not have always one thing on mind be where little ellie went when went home on sunday to very beautiful place said what be beautiful place like where be ah be just what must not say be strange true that one can say that who have be oftenest in even nearest to can say least about make people understand least what be like there be good many folk about other end of nowhere where tom went afterwards who pretend to know from north to south a well a if have be penny postman there a be safe at other end of nowhere nine hundred ninety nine million mile away what say can not concern dear sweet loving wise good self sacrificing people who really go there can never tell anything about save that be most beautiful place in world if ask more grow modest hold peace for fear of being laughed at quite right be so all that good little ellie must say be that be worth rest of world put together of course that only made tom more anxious to go likewise miss ellie said at last will know why can not go with when go home on sunday will have peace give none must ask fairy so when fairy mr bedonebyasyoudid came next tom asked little boy who be only fit to play with sea beast can not go there said who go there must go first where like do what like help somebody like why did ellie do ask ellie blushed said yes tom did not like coming here at first be so much happier at home where be always sunday be afraid of tom at first because because because be over prickle be not prickly now be miss ellie said ellie like very much now like coming here too perhaps said fairy will learn to like going where like helping one like a ellie have put finger in mouth hung head down for did not see that at so when mr doasyouwouldbedoneby came tom asked for thought in little head be not so strict a sister perhaps may let off more easily ah tom tom silly fellow yet know why must blame while so many grown people have got very same notion in head when try get just same answer a tom did for when asked second fairy told just what first did in very same word tom be very unhappy at when ellie went home on sunday fretted cried day did not care to listen to fairy story about good child though be prettier than ever indeed more overheard of le liked to listen because be about child who did what did not like took trouble for other people worked to feed little brother sister instead of caring only for play when began to tell story about holy child in old time who be martyred by heathen because must not worship idol tom must bear more ran away hid among rock when ellie came back be shy with because fancied looked down on thought coward then grew quite cross with because be superior to did what must not do poor ellie be quite surprised sad at last tom burst out cry must not tell what be really in mind while be eaten up with curiosity to know where ellie went to so that began not to care for playmate for sea palace anything else perhaps that made matter easier for for grew so discontented with everything round that did not care to stay did not care where went well said at last be so miserable here will go if only will go with ah said ellie wish might worst of be that fairy say that must go alone if go at now poke that poor crab about tom for be feeling very naughty mischievous fairy will have to punish tom be very nearly saying care if doe stopped in time know what want to do said whining most dolefully want to go after horrid old grime like be certain if find will turn into chimney sweep again know be have be

must not find shouted after did not answer asked other child have not seen at last went up to top of water began cry screaming for mr bedonebyasyoudid perhaps be best thing to do for came in moment oh said tom oh dear oh dear have be naughty to ellie have killed know have killed not quite that said fairy have sent away home will not come back again for know how long at tom cried so bitterly that salt sea be swelled with tear tide be of inch higher than have be day before perhaps be owing to waxing of moon may have be so be considered right in new philosophy know to give spiritual cause for physical phenomenon especially in parlour table of course physical cause for spiritual one like thinking praying knowing right from wrong so odds till come even a folk say down in berkshire how cruel of to send ellie away sobbed tom however will find again if go to world end to look for fairy did not slap tom tell to hold tongue took on lap very kindly just a sister must have done put in mind how

epimetheus got great deal of trouble a most men do in world got three best thing in world into bargain good wife experience hope while prometheus have just a much trouble great deal more a will hear of own making with nothing beside save fancy spun out of own brain a spider spin web out of stomach prometheus kept on looking before so far ahead that a be running about with box of lucifer be only useful thing ever invented do a much harm a good trod on own nose tumbled down a most deductive philosopher do whereby set thames on fire have hardly put out again yet so have to be chained to top of mountain with vulture by to give peck whenever stirred lest must turn whole world upside down with prophecy theory stupid old epimetheus went working grubbing on with help of wife pandora always

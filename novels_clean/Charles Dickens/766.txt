darling child forgive chapter blissful time have gone on loving dora harder than ever idea be refuge in disappointment distress made amends to even for loss of friend more pitied pitied others more sought for consolation in image of dora greater accumulation of deceit trouble in world brighter purer shone star of dora high above world dont think have definite idea where dora came from in what degree be related to higher order of being be quite sure must have scouted notion of being simply human like other young lady with indignation contempt if may so express be steeped in dora be not merely over head ear in love with be saturated through through enough love might have be wrung out of metaphorically speaking to drown anybody in yet there must have remained enough within over to pervade entire existence first thing did on own account when came back be to take night walk to norwood like subject of venerable riddle of childhood to go round round house without ever touching house thinking about dora believe theme of incomprehensible conundrum be moon matter what be moon struck slave of dora perambulated round round house garden for two hour looking through crevice in paling getting chin by dint of violent exertion above rusty nail on top blowing kiss at light in window romantically calling on night at interval to shield dora dont exactly know what from suppose from fire perhaps from mouse to have great objection love be so much in mind be so natural to to confide in peggotty when found again by side of evening with old set of industrial implement busily making tour of wardrobe imparted to in sufficiently roundabout way great secret peggotty be strongly interested must not get into view of case at be audaciously prejudiced in favour quite unable to understand why must have misgiving be low spirited about young lady might think well off observed to have beau a to pa said what did gentleman expect for gracious sake observed however that mr spenlows proctorial gown stiff cravat took peggotty down little inspired with greater reverence for man who be gradually becoming more more etherealized in eye day about whom reflected radiance seemed to to beam when sat erect in court among paper like little lighthouse in sea of stationery by by used to be uncommonly strange to to consider remember a sat in court too how dim old judge doctor wouldnt have cared for dora if have known how wouldnt have gone out of sens with rapture if marriage with dora have be proposed to how dora might have sung played upon glorified guitar until led to verge of madness yet not have tempted one of slow goer inch out of road despised to man frozen out old gardener in flower bed of heart took personal offence against bench be nothing to insensible blunderer bar have more tenderness poetry in than bar of public house taking management of peggottys affair into own hand with little pride proved will came to settlement with legacy duty office took to bank soon got everything into orderly train varied legal character of proceeding by going to see perspiring wax work in fleet street melted must hope twenty year by visiting miss linwoods exhibition remember a mausoleum of needlework favourable to self examination repentance by inspecting tower of london going to top of st paul wonder afforded peggotty a much pleasure a be able to enjoy under existing circumstance except think st paul from long attachment to work box became rival of picture on lid be in particular vanquished considered by work of art peggottys business be what used to call common form business in common very light lucrative common form business be being settled took down to office one morning to pay bill mr spenlow have stepped out old tiffey said to get gentleman sworn for marriage licence a knew must be back directly place lying close to surrogate to vicar general office too told peggotty to wait be little like undertaker in common a regarded probate transaction generally making rule to look more le cut up when have to deal with client in mourning in similar feeling of delicacy be always blithe light hearted with licence client therefore hinted to peggotty that must find mr spenlow much recovered from shock of mr barkiss decease indeed came in like bridegroom peggotty have eye for when saw in company with mr murdstone be very little changed hair looked a thick be certainly a black a ever glance be a little to be trusted a of old ah copperfield said mr spenlow know gentleman believe made gentleman distant bow peggotty barely recognized be at first somewhat disconcerted to meet two together quickly decided what to do came up to hope said that be doing well can hardly be interesting to said yes if wish to know looked at other addressed to peggotty said be sorry to observe that have lost husband not first loss have have in life mr murdstone replied peggotty trembling from head to foot be glad to hope that there be nobody to blame for one nobody to answer for have said thats comfortable reflection have done duty have not worn anybodys life away said peggotty be thankful to think mr murdstone have not worrited frightened sweet creetur to early grave eyed gloomily remorsefully thought for instant said turning head towards looking at foot instead of face be not likely to encounter soon again source of satisfaction to doubt for such meeting a can never be agreeable expect that who always rebelled against just authority exerted for benefit reformation must owe good will now there be antipathy between old one believe said interrupting smiled shot a evil glance at a must come from dark eye rankled in baby breast said embittered life of poor mother be right hope may do better yet hope may correct here ended dialogue have be carried on in low voice in corner of outer office by passing into mr spenlows room saying aloud in smoothest manner gentleman of mr spenlows profession be accustomed to family difference know how complicated difficult always be with that paid money for licence receiving neatly folded from mr spenlow together with shake of hand polite wish for happiness lady went out of office might have have more difficulty in constraining to be silent under word if have have le difficulty in impressing upon peggotty who be only angry on account good creature that be not in place for recrimination that besought to hold peace be so unusually roused be glad to compound for affectionate hug elicited by revival in mind of old injury to make best must of before mr spenlow clerk mr spenlow did not appear to know what connexion between mr murdstone be be glad of for must not bear to acknowledge even in own breast remembering what did of history of poor mother mr spenlow seemed to think if thought anything about matter aunt be leader of state party in family that there be rebel party commanded by somebody else so gathered at least from what said while be waiting for mr tiffey to make out peggottys bill of cost miss trotwood remarked be very firm doubt not likely to give way to opposition have admiration for character may congratulate copperfield on being on right side difference between relation be much to be deplored be extremely general great thing be to be on right side meaning take on side of moneyed interest rather good marriage believe said mr spenlow explained that knew nothing about indeed said speaking from few word mr murdstone dropped a man frequently doe on occasion from what miss murdstone let fall must say be rather good marriage do mean that there be money sir asked yes said mr spenlow understand there money beauty too be told indeed be new wife young just of age said mr spenlow so lately that must think have be waiting for lord deliver said peggotty so very emphatically unexpectedly that be three discomposed until tiffey came in with bill old tiffey soon appeared however handed to mr spenlow to look over mr spenlow settling chin in cravat rubbing softly went over item with deprecatory air a if be jorkinss doing handed back to tiffey with bland sigh yes said thats right quite right must have be extremely happy copperfield to have limited charge to actual expenditure out of pocket be irksome incident in professional life be not at liberty to consult own wish have partner mr jorkins a said with gentle melancholy be next thing to making charge at expressed acknowledgement on peggottys behalf paid tiffey in banknote peggotty then retired to lodging mr spenlow went into court where have divorce suit coming on under ingenious little statute repealed now believe in virtue of have seen several marriage annulled of merit be husband whose name be thomas benjamin have taken out marriage licence a thomas only suppressing benjamin in case must not find a comfortable a expected not finding a comfortable a expected being little fatigued with wife poor fellow now came forward by friend after being married year two declared that name be thomas benjamin therefore be not married at court confirmed to great satisfaction must say that have doubt about strict justice of be not even frightened out of by bushel of wheat reconciles anomaly mr spenlow argued matter with said look at world there be good evil in look at ecclesiastical law there be good evil in be part of system very good there be have not hardihood to suggest to doras father possibly might even improve world little if got up early in morning took off coat to work confessed that thought might improve common mr spenlow replied that must particularly advise to dismiss idea from mind a not being worthy of gentlemanly character that must be glad to hear from of what improvement thought common susceptible taking that part of common happened to be nearest to for man be unmarried by time be out of court strolling past prerogative office submitted that thought prerogative office rather queerly managed institution mr spenlow inquired in what respect replied with due deference to experience with more deference be afraid to being doras father that perhaps be little nonsensical that registry of court containing original will of person leaving effect within immense province of canterbury for three whole century must be accidental building never designed for purpose leased by registrar for own private emolument unsafe not even ascertained to be fire proof choked with important document held positively from roof to basement mercenary speculation of registrar who took great fee from public crammed public will away anyhow anywhere having other object than to get rid of cheaply that perhaps be little unreasonable that registrar in receipt of profit amounting to eight nine thousand pound year to say nothing of profit of deputy registrar clerk of seat must not be obliged to spend little of money in finding reasonably safe place for important document class of people be compelled to hand over to whether must perhaps be little unjust that great office in great office must be magnificent sinecure while unfortunate working clerk in cold dark room upstairs be worst rewarded least considered men doing important service in london that perhaps be little indecent that principal registrar of whose duty be to find public constantly resorting to place needful accommodation must be enormous sinecurist in virtue of post might be besides clergyman pluralist holder of staff in cathedral what not while public be put to inconvenience of have specimen afternoon when office be busy knew to be quite monstrous that perhaps in short prerogative office of diocese of canterbury be altogether such pestilent job pernicious absurdity for being squeezed away in corner of st paul churchyard few people knew must have be turned completely inside out upside down long ago mr spenlow smiled a became modestly warm on subject then argued question with a have argued other said what be after be question of feeling if public felt that will be in safe keeping took for granted that office be not to be made better who be worse for nobody who be better for sinecurists very well then good predominated might not be perfect system nothing be perfect what objected to be insertion of wedge under prerogative office country have be glorious insert wedge into prerogative office country must cease to be glorious considered principle of gentleman to take thing a found have doubt prerogative office must last time deferred to opinion though have great doubt of find be right however for have not only lasted to present moment have done so in teeth of great parliamentary report made not too willingly eighteen year ago when objection of mine be set forth in detail when existing stowage for will be described a equal to accumulation of only two year half more what have done with since whether have lost many whether sell now then to butter shop dont know be glad mine be not there hope may not go there yet awhile have set down in present blissful chapter because here come into natural place mr spenlow falling into conversation prolonged saunter to fro until diverged into general topic so came about in end mr spenlow told day week be doras birthday must be glad if must come down join little picnic on occasion went out of sens immediately became mere driveller next day on receipt of little lace edged sheet of note paper favoured by papa to remind passed intervening period in state of dotage think committed possible absurdity in way of preparation for blessed event turn hot when remember cravat bought

accordingly when mentioned with greatest precaution to mr crewler mama said mama said traddles reverend horace crewler when mentioned with possible precaution to mr crewler effect upon be such that gave scream became insensible couldnt approach subject again for month did at last said well reverend horace did said traddles be excellent man most exemplary in way pointed out to that ought a christian to reconcile to sacrifice especially a be so uncertain to bear uncharitable feeling towards a to copperfield give word felt perfect bird of prey towards family sister took part hope traddles why cant say did returned when have comparatively reconciled mr crewler to have to break to sarah recollect mentioning sarah a one have something matter with spine perfectly clenched hand said

on anything on approaching house where miss spenlow lived be at such discount in respect of personal look presence of mind that traddles proposed gentle stimulant in form of glass of ale having be administered at neighbouring public house conducted with tottering step to miss spenlows door have vague sensation of being a be on view when maid opened of wavering somehow across hall with weather glass in into quiet little drawing room on ground floor commanding neat garden also of sitting down here on sofa seeing traddless hair start up now hat be removed like one of obtrusive little figure made of spring fly out of fictitious snuff box when lid be taken off also of hearing old fashioned clock ticking away on chimney piece trying to make keep time to jerking of heart wouldnt also of looking round room for sign of dora seeing none also of thinking that jip once barked in distance be instantly choked by somebody ultimately found backing traddles into fireplace bowing in great confusion to two dry little elderly lady dressed in black looking wonderfully like preparation in chip tan of late mr spenlow pray said one of two little lady be seated when have done tumbling over traddles have sat upon something be not cat first seat be so far recovered sight a to perceive mr spenlow have evidently be youngest of family that there be disparity of six eight year between two

consider most calculated to promote happiness of party discovered afterwards that miss lavinia be authority in affair of heart by reason of there having anciently existed certain mr pidger who played short whist be supposed to have be enamoured of private opinion be that be entirely gratuitous assumption that pidger be altogether innocent of such sentiment to have never given sort of expression must ever hear of miss lavinia miss clarissa have superstition however that must have declared passion if have not be cut short in youth at about sixty by over drinking constitution over doing attempt to set right again by swilling bath water have lurking suspicion even that died of secret love though must say there be picture of in house with damask nose concealment did not appear to have ever preyed upon will not said miss lavinia enter on past history of matter poor brother franciss death have cancelled that have not said miss clarissa be in habit of frequent association with brother francis there be decided division disunion between francis took road took ours considered conducive to happiness of party that must be so be so of sister leaned little forward to speak shook head after speaking became upright again when silent miss clarissa never moved arm sometimes played tune upon with finger minuet march must think never moved niece position supposed position be much changed by brother franciss death said miss lavinia therefore consider brother opinion a regarded position a being changed too have reason to doubt mr copperfield that be young gentleman possessed of good quality honourable character that have affection be fully persuaded that have affection for niece replied a usually did whenever have chance that nobody have ever loved anybody else a loved dora traddles came to assistance with confirmatory murmur miss lavinia be going on to make rejoinder when miss clarissa who appeared to be incessantly beset by desire to refer to brother francis struck in again if doras mama said when married brother francis have at once said that there be not room for family at dinner table must have be better for happiness of party sister clarissa said miss lavinia perhaps neednt mind now sister lavinia said miss clarissa belongs to subject with branch of subject on alone be competent to speak must not think of interfering on branch of subject have voice opinion must have be better for happiness of party if doras mama when married brother francis have mentioned plainly what intention be must then have known what have to expect must have said pray invite at time possibility of misunderstanding must have be avoided when miss clarissa have shaken head miss lavinia resumed again referring to letter through eye glass have little bright round twinkling eye by way be like bird eye be not unlike bird altogether having sharp brisk sudden manner little short spruce way of adjusting like canary miss lavinia a have said resumed ask permission of sister clarissa mr copperfield to visit here a accepted suitor of niece if brother francis said miss clarissa breaking out again if may call anything so calm breaking out wished to surround with atmosphere of doctor common of doctor common only what right desire have to object none be sure have ever be far from wishing to obtrude ourselves on anyone why not say so let brother francis wife have society let sister lavinia have society can find for hope a appeared to be addressed to traddles traddles made sort of reply traddles be inaudible think observed that be highly creditable to concerned dont in least know what meant sister lavinia said miss clarissa having now relieved mind can go on dear miss lavinia proceeded mr copperfield sister clarissa have be very careful indeed in considering letter have not considered without finally showing to niece discussing with niece have doubt that think like very much think maam rapturously began oh miss clarissa giving look just like sharp canary a requesting

experience of stricken pidger saw from gravity with miss clarissa nodded head that great weight be attached to word light for call in comparison with such sentiment light inclination of very young people pursued miss lavinia be dust compared to rock be owing to difficulty of knowing whether be likely to endure have real foundation that sister clarissa have be very undecided how to act mr copperfield mr traddles said friend finding looked at beg pardon of inner temple believe said miss clarissa again glancing at letter traddles said exactly so became pretty red in face now although have not received express encouragement a yet fancied that saw in two little sister particularly in miss lavinia intensified enjoyment of new fruitful subject of domestic interest settling down to make most of disposition to pet in there be good bright ray of hope thought perceived that miss lavinia must have uncommon satisfaction in superintending two young lover like dora that miss clarissa must have hardly le satisfaction in seeing superintend in chiming in with own particular department of subject whenever impulse be strong upon gave courage to protest most vehemently loved dora better than must tell anyone believe that friend knew how loved that aunt agnes traddles everyone who knew knew how loved how earnest love have made for truth of appealed to traddles traddles firing up a if be plunging into parliamentary debate really did come out nobly confirming in good round term in plain sensible practical manner evidently made favourable impression speak if may presume to say so a one who have little experience of such thing said traddles being engaged to young lady one of ten down in devonshire seeing probability at present of engagement coming to termination may be able to confirm what have said mr traddles observed miss lavinia evidently taking new interest in of affection be modest retiring that wait wait entirely maam said traddles miss clarissa looked at miss lavinia shook head gravely miss lavinia looked consciously at miss clarissa heaved little sigh sister lavinia said miss clarissa take smelling bottle miss lavinia revived with few whiff of aromatic vinegar traddles looking on with great solicitude while then went on to say rather faintly sister have be in great doubt mr traddles what course ought to take in reference to liking imaginary liking of such very young people a friend mr copperfield niece brother franciss child remarked miss clarissa if brother franciss wife have found convenient in lifetime though have unquestionable right to act a thought best to invite family to dinner table might have known brother franciss child better at present moment sister lavinia proceed miss lavinia turned letter so a to bring superscription towards referred through eye glass to orderly looking note have made on part of seems to said prudent mr traddles to bring feeling to test of own observation at present know nothing of be not in situation to

opportunity until have have opportunity sister lavinia said miss clarissa be so assented miss lavinia with sigh until have have opportunity of observing copperfield said traddles turning to feel be

require from mr copperfield distinct assurance on word of honour that communication of kind will take place between niece without knowledge that project will be entertained with regard to niece without being first submitted to to sister lavinia miss clarissa interposed be so clarissa assented miss lavinia resignedly to receiving concurrence must make most express serious stipulation not to be broken on account wished mr copperfield to be accompanied by confidential friend today with inclination of head towards traddles who bowed in order that there might be doubt misconception on subject if mr copperfield if mr traddles feel least scruple in giving promise beg to take time to consider exclaimed in state of high ecstatic fervour that not moment consideration must be necessary

of button of coat might have be more clever perhaps love said what nonsense do think be nonsense returned dora without looking at be sure be of course be have forgotten said dora still turning button round round what relation agnes be to dear bad boy blood relation replied be brought up together like brother sister wonder why ever fell in love with said dora beginning on button of coat perhaps because couldnt see not love dora suppose have never seen at said dora going to button suppose have never be born said gaily wondered what be thinking about a glanced in admiring silence at little

love gratitude then walked slowly forth have engaged bed at decent alehouse close by be going out at gate when happening to turn head saw light in doctor study half reproachful fancy came into mind that have be working at dictionary without help with view of seeing if be so in case of bidding good night if be yet sitting among book turned back going softly across hall gently opening door looked in first person whom saw to surprise by sober light of shaded lamp be uriah be standing close beside with one of skeleton hand over mouth other resting on doctor table doctor sat in study chair covering face with hand mr wickfield sorely troubled distressed be leaning forward irresolutely touching doctor arm for instant supposed that doctor be ill hastily advanced step under impression when met uriah eye saw what be matter must have withdrawn doctor made gesture to detain remained at rate observed uriah with writhe of ungainly person may keep door shut neednt make known to town saying went on toe to door have left open carefully closed then came back took up former position there be obtrusive show of compassionate zeal in voice manner more intolerable at least to than demeanour must have assumed have felt incumbent upon master copperfield said uriah to point out to doctor strong what have already talked about didnt exactly understand though gave look other answer going to good old master said few word meant to be word of comfort encouragement put hand upon shoulder a have be custom to do when be quite little fellow did not lift grey head a didnt understand master copperfield resumed uriah in same officious manner may take liberty of umbly mentioning being among friend have called doctor strongs attention to going on of mr strong much against grain with assure copperfield to be concerned in anything so unpleasant really a be be mixing up with what oughtnt to be be what meaning be sir when didnt understand wonder now when recall leer did not collar try to shake breath out of body dare say didnt make very clear went on naturally be of inclined to give such subject wide berth howsever at last have made up mind to speak plain have mentioned to doctor strong that did speak sir be to doctor who have moaned sound might have touched heart thought have effect upon uriah mentioned to doctor strong proceeded that anyone may see that mr maldon lovely agreeable lady a be doctor strongs wife be too sweet on one really time be come being at present mixing ourselves up with what oughtnt to be when doctor strong must be told that be full a plain to everybody a sun before mr maldon went to india mr maldon made excuse to come back for nothing else that he always here for nothing else when come in sir be just putting to fellow partner towards whom turned to say to doctor strong upon word honour whether hed ever be of opinion long ago not come mr wickfield sir must be so good a tell yes sir come partner for god sake dear doctor said mr wickfield

with what oughtnt to be dear strong said mr wickfield in tremulous voice good friend neednt tell that have be vice to look for one master motive in everybody to try action by one narrow test may have fallen into such doubt a have have through mistake have have doubt wickfield said doctor without lifting up head have have doubt speak up fellow partner urged uriah have at one time certainly said mr wickfield god forgive thought have returned doctor in tone of most pathetic grief thought at one time said mr wickfield that wished to send maldon abroad to effect desirable separation returned doctor to give annie pleasure by making provision for companion of childhood nothing else so found said mr wickfield couldnt doubt when told so thought implore to remember narrow construction have be besetting sin that in case where there be so much disparity in point of year thats way to put see master copperfield observed uriah with fawning offensive pity lady of such youth such attraction however real respect for might have be influenced in marrying by worldly consideration only make allowance for innumerable feeling circumstance may have tended to good for heaven sake remember that how kind put said uriah shaking head always observing from one point of view said mr wickfield by be dear to old friend entreat to consider what be be forced to confess now having escape there way out of mr wickfield sir observed uriah when got to did said mr wickfield glancing helplessly distractedly at partner that did doubt think wanting in duty to that did sometimes if must say feel averse to agnes being in familiar relation towards a to see what saw in diseased theory fancied that saw never mentioned to anyone never meant to be known to anyone though be terrible to to hear said mr wickfield quite subdued if knew how terrible be for to tell must feel compassion for doctor in perfect goodness of nature put out hand mr wickfield held for little while in with head bowed down be

conversation think that best embodiment of chivalry realization of handsomest most romantic figure ever imagined by painter must have said with more impressive affecting dignity than plain old doctor did be not prepared went on to deny perhaps may have be without knowing in degree prepared to admit may have unwittingly ensnared that lady into unhappy marriage be man quite unaccustomed to observe can not believe that observation of several people of different age position too plainly tending in one direction that so natural be better than mine have often admired a have elsewhere described benignant manner towards youthful wife respectful tenderness manifested in reference to on occasion almost reverential manner in put away from lightest doubt of integrity exalted in eye beyond description married that lady said doctor when be extremely young took to myself when character be scarcely formed so far a be developed have be happiness to form knew father well knew well have taught what must for love of beautiful virtuous quality if did wrong a fear did in taking advantage never meant of gratitude affection ask pardon of lady in heart walked across room came back to same place holding chair with grasp trembled like subdued voice in earnestness regarded a refuge for from danger vicissitude of life persuaded that unequal though be in year must live tranquilly contentedly with did not shut out of consideration time when must leave free still young still beautiful with judgement more matured gentleman upon truth homely figure seemed to be lightened up by fidelity generosity word uttered have force other grace must have imparted to life with lady have be very happy until tonight have have uninterrupted occasion to bless day on did great injustice voice

family by hand when lion must lie down with lamb family be on term with mr micawber said thought so too at least be light dear mr copperfield pursued mr micawber in view subject when lived at home with papa mama papa be accustomed to ask when point be under discussion in limited circle in what light doe emma view subject that papa be too partial know still on point a frigid coldness have ever subsisted between mr micawber family necessarily have formed opinion delusive though may be doubt of course have maam said aunt precisely so assented mr micawber now may be wrong in conclusion be very likely that be individual impression be that gulf between family mr micawber may be traced to apprehension on part of family that mr micawber must require pecuniary accommodation can not help thinking

never understood micawber said wife may be incapable of if so be misfortune can pity misfortune be extremely sorry dear emma said mr micawber relenting to have be betrayed into expression might even remotely have appearance of being strong expression must say be that can go abroad without family coming forward to favour in short with parting shove of cold shoulder upon whole must rather leave england with such impetus a posse than derive acceleration of from quarter at same time dear if must condescend to reply to communication joint experience render most improbable far be from to be

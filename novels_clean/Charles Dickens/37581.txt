clock be going to strike be frightful to behold when cuckoo looked out of trap door in palace gave note six time shook time like spectral voice like something wiry plucking at leg be not until violent commotion whirring noise among weight rope below have quite subsided that terrified haymaker became again be startled without reason for rattling bony skeleton of clock be very disconcerting in operation wonder very much how set of men most of how dutchman can have have liking to invent for there be popular belief that dutchman love broad case much clothing for own lower self might know better than to leave clock so very lank unprotected surely now be observe that kettle began to spend evening now be that kettle growing mellow musical began to have irrepressible gurglings in throat to indulge in short vocal snort checked in bud a if have quite made up mind yet to be good company now be that after two three such vain attempt to stifle convivial sentiment threw off moroseness reserve burst into stream of song so cosy hilarious a never maudlin nightingale yet formed least idea of so plain too bless might have understood like book better than book must name perhaps with warm breath gushing forth in light cloud merrily gracefully ascended few foot then hung about chimney corner a own domestic heaven trolled song with strong energy of cheerfulness that iron body hummed

say that anything be what ought to be be coming coming coming here if like cricket did chime in with chirrup chirrup chirrup of such magnitude by way of chorus with voice so astoundingly disproportionate to size a compared with kettle size must see that if have then there burst like overcharged gun if have fallen victim on spot chirruped little body into fifty piece must have seemed natural inevitable consequence for have expressly laboured kettle have have last of solo performance persevered with undiminished ardour cricket took first fiddle kept good heaven how chirped shrill
